0,2004,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,American,"Shy, soft-spoken Joel Barish and unrestrained free-spirit Clementine Kruczynski begin a relationship on a Long Island Rail Road train from Montauk to Rockville Centre. They are almost immediately drawn to each other, despite their contrasting personalities, and both had felt the need to travel to Montauk that day. Although they do not realize it, Joel and Clementine are, in fact, former lovers, now separated after having spent two years together. After a fight, Clementine had hired the New York City firm Lacuna, Inc. to erase all of her memories of their relationship. Upon discovering this from his friends Rob and Carrie, Joel was devastated and decided to undergo the procedure himself, a process that takes place while he sleeps.
Much of the film subsequently takes place in Joel's mind, during this memory erasure procedure. Joel finds himself revisiting his memories of Clementine in reverse, starting from the disintegration of their relationship. As he comes across happier, positive memories of Clementine early in his relationship, he decides to preserve at least some memory of her and his love for her, trying to evade the procedure by taking his idealized memory of Clementine into memories not related to her, or waking up to stop the process. Despite his efforts, the memories are steadily erased. He comes to the last remaining memory of Clementine, the day he had first met her at a beach house in Montauk. As this memory disintegrates around them, she tells him, ""Meet me in Montauk.""
Separate, but related, story arcs revolving around the employees of Lacuna are revealed during Joel's memory erasure. Patrick, one of the Lacuna technicians performing the erasure, uses Joel's memories and mannerisms to seduce and romance Clementine. Mary, the Lacuna receptionist, is dating the other memory-erasing technician, Stan, but has feelings for Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, the married doctor and head of Lacuna. During Joel's memory wipe, Mary discovers she had previously had an affair with Dr. Mierzwiak and agreed to have this erased from her memory when Dr. Mierzwiak's wife found out. On learning this, she asks Stan whether he knew about this, to which he claims that he didn't. Mary then quits her job and steals the company's records, mailing them to all of Lacuna's customers out of revenge.
The film returns to the present, after Joel and Clementine have met at the train station of Montauk. They both come upon their Lacuna records later that day, and react with shock and bewilderment – they have no clear memory of having known each other, let alone having had a relationship and having had their memories erased. Joel pleads with Clementine to restart their relationship; Clementine initially resists, pointing out it could go the same way. Joel accepts this and they decide to try anyway.",8.3,tt0338013,"Montauk train on track ""B."" Random thoughts for Valentine's Day, 2004. Today is a holiday invented by greeting card companies... Last call... to make people feel like crap. I ditched work today. Took a train out to Montauk. Montauk train boarding on track ""B."" I don't know why. Aah! I'm not an impulsive person. I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning. I gotta get my car fixed. Hi. Cindy? It's Joel. Joel! Listen, I don't feel very well today. No, food poisoning, I think. It's goddamn freezing on this beach. Montauk in February. Brilliant, Joel. Page is ripped out. Don't remember doing that. It appears this is my first entry in two years. Sand is overrated. It's just tiny little rocks. If only I could meet someone new. I guess my chances of that happening are somewhat diminished, seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know. Maybe I should get back together with Naomi. She was nice. Nice is good. She loved me. Why do I fall in love with every woman I see... who shows me the least bit of attention? Hi. I'm sorry? - I just said hi. - Hi. Hello. Hi. Okay if I sit closer? How far are you going? Uh, Rockville Center. Get out! Me too! Really? What are the odds? Do I know you? Do you ever shop at Barnes  Noble? Sure. Sure. That's it! Yeah? I've seen you, man! Book slave there for, like, five years now. Ah. I would have thought I would've remembered you. Jesus! Is it five years? It might be the hair. What might? It changes a lot. The color. That's why you might not recognize me. It's called Blue Ruin, the color. Right. Yeah. Snappy name, huh? I like it. Yeah. Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red... Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. You think there could possibly be a job like that? I mean, how many hair colors could there be? Fifty, maybe. Someone's got that job. Agent Orange! I came up with that one. I apply my personality in a paste. Oh, I doubt that very much. Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you? Sorry. I was just... I'm trying to be nice. Yeah. I got it. My name's Clementine, by the way. I'm Joel. Hi, Joel. Hey. No jokes about my name. Oh, no, you wouldn't do that. You're trying to be nice. I don't know any jokes about your name. Huckleberry Hound. I don't know what that means. Huckleberry Hound? What are you, nuts? It's been suggested. No? I'm sorry. Just... It's a pretty name, though. It really is nice. It's, uh... It means ""merciful."" Right? Clemency? Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told. Gee, I-I wouldn't think that about you. Why wouldn't you think that about me? I don't know. I just... I don't know. I just, uh... You seem nice, so... Oh, now I'm nice? Oh, God. Don't you know any other adjectives? I don't need ""nice."" I don't need myself to be it, and I don't need anybody else to be it at me. Okay. Joel? It's Joel, right? Yes. I'm sorry I yelled at you. I'm a little out of sorts today. My embarrassing admission is, I really like that you're nice right now. I mean, I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm gonna like, but right now... I'm glad you are. I have so much stuff that, uh, I probably should, uh... Oh! I'm sorry. Okay. I-I'm writing, and... No, no. I just... Sure. No. That's okay. I just have... You know, this is... Okay. - Ohh! Hey! - Take care, then. Jesus! Hi. I could, uh, give you a ride, if you need. It's cold. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah? It is frosty. You're not a stalker or anything, right? I'm not a stalker. You're the one that talked to me. Remember? That is the oldest trick in the stalker book. Really? There's a stalker book? Mm-hmm. Okay. I gotta read that one. Look, I'm sorry if I came off sorta nutso. I'm not, really. Oh, it's okay. I didn't think you were. Did you wanna have a drink? I have lots of drinks, and I could, um... Um... Never mind. Sorry. That was stupid. I'm embarrassed now. No, no, no, no. Good night, Joel. Two Blue Ruins. Thank you. Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant. I'm just kidding! Come on. You're kinda closed-mouthed, aren't you? I'm sorry. It's just, you know, my life isn't that interesting. I go to work, I come home. Don't know what to say. You should read my journal. I mean, it's just... blank. Really? Does that make you sad or anxious? I mean, I'm always anxious, thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, taking advantage of every possibility, making sure I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have. I think about that. Yeah? You're really nice. Ohh! God, I have to stop saying that. I'm gonna marry you. I know it. Um... okay. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime. It gets frozen this time of year. That sounds scary. Exactly. I'll pack a picnic. A night picnic. Night picnics are different. And, um, we could... Sounds good. But I... I should, uh, go. Now. You should stay. No, I really... I'm... I... I have to get up so early. I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like it. Yes. Wish me a happy Valentine's Day when you call! That'd be nice. What took you so long? I just walked in. Mm-hmm. You miss me? Yeah. Oddly enough, I do. Oh! You said ""I do."" I guess that means were married. I guess so. Tomorrow night? Honeymoon on ice? It's really solid this time of year. Whoa! I don't know. Come on. Come on. Eee! Come on. Come on, come on. Whew. Oh. So beautiful. Isn't it? Uh, don't go too far. - Whoo! Oww! Ow! - Whoa! Oh! - Are you okay? - Ouch! Fuck it. Ohh! Oh, my ass! I think I should go back. Come on. Come on! What if it breaks? - ""What if""? Do you really care right now? - Huh? Come here. Please. Come on. Ohh. Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Slidy-slidy. Slidy-slidy. Whoa! This is good. Here, let me show you this one thing. What are you doing? Whoa. Come on. Think I heard a crack. It's not gonna crack or break or... It's so thick. Show me which constellations you know. Um... Oh. I don't... know any. Show me which ones you know. Okay. Okay. Oh. Here's Osidius. Where? Right there. See? Sort of a swoop and a cross. Osidius the Emphatic. You're full of shit. Right? Nope. Osidius is right there. Swoop and cross. Shut the fuck up! Clementine. Cock-a-doodle-doo. Hey. Hey. Hey. Sorry to wake you, but we're... here. Ahh. Can I come over to your house... to sleep? I'm so tired. Okay. Um, yeah. Sure. Let me get my toothbrush. Yeah. Oh. Just... Yes? Can I help you? What do you mean? Can I help you with something? No. What are you doing here? I'm not really sure what you're asking me. Oh. Thanks. We're looking for 159. What number's that? I don't know where that is. Jesus Christ, you'd think they'd light the number, or at least put a number on... Is that him? I think so. Yeah, that's him. Wait. That's him. Hey, Joel. Frank. Oh, shit. Jesus. The only Valentine's Day cards I get are from my mother. How pathetic is that, huh? You're lucky you have Clementine, man. She is way cool. Hey, you got any big Valentine's Day plans with her? No. Well, it's only a day away. Better make some reservations or something. Don't want to end up at Mickey D's. Right? McRomance! You want some fries with that shake? I have to, uh, go to sleep now, Frank. It's 8:30. Patrick, stop it. Ohh! Okay. Okay. Okay. Whew. Okay. Showtime at the Apollo. Shh, shh, shh. Hey. Quiet. Hey, Joel. What's up? Oh. Hi, Frank. I only get Valentine's Day cards from my mom. How pathetic is that? You're lucky you have Clementine, Joel. Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big Valentine's Day plans with her? No. It's only a day away. Better make a reservation or something. Don't wanna end up at Mickey D's. Oh, no! Yes! Valentine's Day is three goddamn days away! I want it resolved. I'm willing to be the one to resolve it. So I call her, and she's changed her number. So I walked over to Antic Attic, you know, to get her something. I thought I'd go over to work, give her an early valentine, and... You won't believe it. She's there with... this guy, this really young guy. And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am. Excuse me? Can I help you find something, sir? Hey, Clem-ato. Patrick! Baby boy. What you doing here, baby? Just came to surprise you. Let me know if you need something, sir. You look good. Hi. How are you? Pretty good. Pretty bored. Pretty tired. Uh-huh. I so want what's in your suit. Oh, good. Why? Why would she do that to me? Hey, does anybody want a joint? Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest. Oh, God. She's punishing me. I know, honey. For being honest. It's horrible. I should just go to her house. No! No, no, no. You don't wanna go there, man. You don't wanna go there. Get off. It's too... Right. Yeah. I don't want to seem desperate. Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign, make a clean break. Right? Right? All right, Joel, look, man, seriously. Rob! Here's the deal. Don't do that. Rob, what are you doing? No, no, no, no. What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie? What's your brilliant, reasoned solution? You're gonna make this about our shit now? This isn't about us. I agree. It's not about us. It's about Joel, who's an adult. Okay? Not Mama Carrie's kid. - What are you... - That's your laundry! That's great. That's good. Okay. What is it? I don't know. It's some place that does a thing. Good morning. Lacuna. No, I'm sorry. That offer expired after the new year. Yeah, sure. We can fit you in... How about on the fifth? That's a Wednesday. All right, great. Could you spell that, please? Okay, and we'll need a daytime phone number. Great. Have a nice day. See you then. May I help you? I'm Joel Barish. Excuse me? I'm Joel. Barish. I have an appointment with Dr... Mierzwiak. - Here. Could you please fill this out? - I just want to talk to him. You still need to fill the form out, sir. Really? - Thank you. - Great. I don't have a pen. There's a pen right there. Good morning. Lacuna. Oh. Oh, yeah, that offer. That's done now. That expired after the new year. Mr. Barish? How are we today? Not too good, actually. Boo! Oh, my God! Stan! Sorry. Sorry, I was just... I'm working! Sorry. Sorry. Here, Doctor. Thank you. You should not have seen this. I apologize. This is a hoax, right? I mean, this is Clem... I assure you, no. No. Mm-mmm. There's no such thing as this. Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence. Suffice it to say that Miss, uh... Miss Kruczynski was not happy, and she wanted to move on. We provide that possibility. ""Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on. We provide that possibility."" What the hell is that? Nicest guy she ever went out with. Oww! Fuck! God, Rob! Give it a rest! It's okay. It's all right. Carrie, I am making a birdhouse. What can I say, Joel? You know Clementine. She's like that. She's impulsive. She decided to erase you almost as a lark. A lark. Why? Why? Why? Why did you do that? Wait, wait, wait, wait! I'm sorry, Doctor. He just barged right in here. Okay. I want it done. I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time. - Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary. - But there are people waiting. Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh... to come inside. And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo. Good-bye, Mrs. Woo. Yes, of course. Now, the, uh... the first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish, is to go home... and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine. Anything. And we'll use these items to create a map of Clementine in your brain. Okay? So we'll need, uh, uh, photos, clothing, gifts, books she may have bought you, CDs you may have bought together, journal entries. We want to empty your home... We want to empty your life of Clementine. And after the mapping is done, our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight. That way, when you awake in the morning, you'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened... a new life awaiting you. Wake up, buddy! No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel. You can't have the procedure done three times in one month. Well, it's just not our policy... How are you today, Mr. Barish? Hello. I'm right here. I know it's an emergency, and we'll do everything we can... We can fit you in on the first of March. Maybe you could talk to the doctor, a- and he... All right, so let's make an appointment. What day would you like to come in this week? Mr. Barish. Um, he's really busy this afternoon. Maybe tomorrow would be better. Around 12:15? Can you do that? February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day. This is, uh, Stan Fink, one of our most experienced and skilled technicians. He'll be handling your case tonight. Great to meet you, Mr. Barish. My name is Joel Barish, and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski. Very good. Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine. Uh, I was... living with this woman, Naomi, uh, a couple years ago, and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach... I don't like parties. Naomi couldn't go, but I went... and I, uh, met Clementine. I'm sorry. Let's start with your most recent memories... and work backwards from there, more or less. There's an emotional core... to each of our memories, and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process. By the time you wake up in the morning, all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared, as in a dream upon waking. Is there any risk of brain damage? Well, uh, technically speaking, the procedure is brain damage, but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss. Comfortable? What we're doing here, Mr. Barish, is actually creating a map of your brain. Okay, let's get started. If we want to get this procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do. I want you to react to these objects, Mr. Barish, if you will. There's a good story behind this one... Uh, actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get a much better emotional readout... if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items. Just try to focus on the memories. Oh. Sorry. Okay. Healthy activity up there again. Healthy readouts. Very good. - Here's another object. - That's so... Next item. Okay. Potato head. Next item. Okay. Just focus on the memories. Patrick, do me a favor. Hey, Patrick, do me a favor, will ya? Yeah. Can you check the voltage regulator? What do we got there? Uh, voltage looks fine. Really? Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here. I'm... Well, uh, technically the procedure is brain damage. Check the, uh... Check the connections, please. Oh, there you are. I... Why am I... I don't understand what I'm looking at. Why am I standing here and... Oh, my God. Déjà vu. Déjà vu. This is so... All right, we should get started. If we're gonna get the procedure... underway tonight, we have some work to do. I'm in my head already, aren't I? I suppose so. Uh, this is about right. This is what it... This is what it would look like. Very good. We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here. That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home. Ah, there we go. Patrick? Yeah? Patrick, can you check... Patrick? I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice. Patrick? Patrick? - Why are there so many wires? - A lot of equipment. - Does that help? - Are you sure you set that thing up properly? How's that? How are you today, Mr. Barish? There we are, Mr. Barish. That's better. - I don't know if I like this. - Think I might try this, then. We're almost done now. Mmm. Journal. That would be invaluable. ""I met someone tonight. I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine, and she's amazing."" Whoa! Jesus! What? What? Come on! Careful! Step back! Just take it easy. That's fine. Let's not roach the guy. All right, you got that one. This place is sort of a dump, don't you think? It's an apartment, Patrick. Patrick. Well, not a dump, then, but sorta plain. Uninspired. And there's sort of a stale smell. Patrick, can we just please get through this? We got a very long night ahead of us. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. This is the last time I saw you. It's 3:00. I kinda sorta wrecked your car. Were you driving drunk? It's pathetic. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic. Well, it is pathetic. It's fucking irresponsible. Could've killed somebody. Oh, God. Maybe you did kill somebody. Should we turn on the news and see? Oh, Christ! Should I check the grill to see if there's any children or small animals? I didn't kill anybody! It's just a fucking dent, Joel. You're like an old lady or something. Well, what are you like? A wino? A wino? Jesus, are you from the '50s or something? A wino? Face it, Joely. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain... you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight? No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you? I'm sorry. Okay? Clem, I didn't mean it. All right? Clem? Your keys. I was just... I was just... I won't need them anymore. Angry or annoyed or something, I don't know. Clem? Got it. Mary's coming over tonight. Yeah? Yeah. Just thought you'd wanna know. I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me. She likes you okay. Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over. I have a girlfriend now. Do whatever you want. Did I tell you I have... Yeah. Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend? We gotta focus here, Patrick. Yeah, the thing is, our situation is... is a little weird. My girlfriend situation. I'm sure it is. You gotta be... Clem, let me drive you home. Get out of my face, faggot! Look at it out here! It's all falling apart! I'm erasing you, and I'm happy! You did it to me first! I can't believe you did this to me. Goddamn it. Clem! Can you hear me? By morning you'll be gone! The perfect ending to this piece-of-shit story! Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me? Is that a problem? No, I think it's... funny. So, who do you think's better-looking, me or this guy? Patrick, let's focus, buddy. Remember that girl we did last week? The one with the... potatoes? That girl? That's this guy's girl. Right. Yeah. Was. We took care of that. Oh, God! Well, uh... I kinda fell in love with her that night. What? You little fuck... What? She was unconscious, man. Well, she was beautiful, and... I stole a pair of her panties as well. Jesus! What? It's not like... I mean, they were clean and all. Don't tell me this stuff, man! I don't wanna hear this shit! They were clean! What? D-Don't! Stop! Okay. Yeah! All right! We got work to do. Give me my papers. There's, um... There's more. After we did her, I kind of... went to where she works and asked her out. You what? Jesus. Jesus, Patrick! Do you have... any idea... how unethical... It's not really that bad. What? Get that look off your face. What's wrong? Patrick, you stole a girl's panties! There's someone here. He stole your underwear. I don't see anyone. Joel? Where are my boots? Why are you showing me poisons? Can't you understand English? ""Potions,"" I said. Potions. Love potion, please. I'm fucking crawling out of my skin! Should've left you at the flea market. First thing to do is... sift in a cup of powdered whale heart. Wanna go? I want to have a baby. Let's talk about it later. No! I want to have a baby. I don't think we're ready. You're not ready. Clem, do you really think you could take care of a kid? What? I don't wanna talk about it here. I can't hear you. I can never the fuck understand what you're saying. I don't wanna talk about this! Fucking ventriloquist! We're fucking gonna talk about it! I... don't... want... to... You can't just say something like that and say you don't wanna talk about it! I'm sorry, Clem. I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children, I'm creative and smart, and I'd make a fucking great mother! Oh, God... Mmm! It's you, Joel. It's you who can't commit to anything! It's going! It's going! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! Maybe I should end this right here, Joel! Leave you at the flea market with this stupid costume jewelry! It's done. This is crap. Maybe you could find yourself an antique rocking chair to die in! All the pain, confusion... Oh. Hi, Patrick. Hi, Mary. How's it goin'? Hey, you. Oh, it's freezing outside. Find us okay? Yeah. Mmm. Hot! Poor guy. Mmm? Oh. Don't you have anything real to drink? Uh, we haven't really checked yet. Patrick? Uh, yeah. Uh, let me do the honors. Mary hates me. Never really had much luck with the ladies. Maybe if you stop stealing their panties. Stan. Stan. There's more. No! Yes. No! Hey, hey! Oh, you didn't want any, did you, Patrick? Uh, no, that's okay. Wait. ""Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."" Oh. Oh! Oh! Mmm! That's Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. I found it in my Bartlett's. What's your Bartlett's? It's a quote book, Patrick. It's a book of quotations. I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day. Definitely. Howard is pure Bartlett's. God! Can you wake him up? You can't wake him up. Mmm. You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me. Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating. I don't do that. I want to know you. Hmm? I don't constantly talk. Jesus! People have to share things, Joel. Mm-hmm. That's what intimacy is. I'm really pissed that you said that to me. I'm sorry. It just... really just isn't that interesting. I wanna read some of those journals you're constantly scribbling in. What do you write in there if you don't have any thoughts or passions or... love? November 19, 2003. Dinner at Kang's again. Are we like those poor couples... you feel sorry for in restaurants? Are we the dining dead? I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about. I like that. How's the chicken? Good. More? No. No. Thank you. She's gonna be drunk and stupid now. Hey, would you do me a favor... and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower? Yeah. Oh. Yeah. It's really... - Gross. - gross. - It's just... - Repulsive. It's repulsive. Patrick, can we get through this? Patrick. Hey, Tangerine. Oh, Patrick, it's you. I'm so miserable right now. Why? What's wrong? I don't know. Excuse me? I'm so confused! Can I help you find something, sir? Confused? What are you confused about? Everything's fine. Baby, come here. Scared of what? Do you love me? Of course I do. Where's the self-help section? Do you think I'm ugly? No! You're beautiful! Maybe I should come over. No, no. I don't know. I- I'm a mess, Patrick. Well, just let me come over. I'll cheer you up. Okay. Stan, can I leave for a while? My girlfriend's really upset. We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's... Let him go, Stan! Let him go. I'll help. See? How hard can it be? - She hates me. She wants me to go. - Go. All right. I'll be right over, Tangerine. You like? Oh, man! I matched my sweatshirt exactly. I like it. You do? You look like a tangerine. Ohh! ""Clemen-teen"" the tangerine. Mmm! Juicy! And seedless. I like that. I like tangerines! Can you see me doing ducks? Tangerine. Joel. Ducks. Quack-quack. How does he know to call you that? How did who know? Oh, my God. Clem? This is pretty cool. That's what they called themselves. The Clash... the only band that mattered. They called themselves that for a reason. It's amazing, isn't it? Like social justice... Yeah, it's totally incredible. What Howard gives to the world. Yeah. To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so clean. And adults are, like, this mess of sadness... and... phobias. Howard just makes it all go away. Oh, my God. Baby, what's going on? I don't know. I don't know! I'm lost, I'm scared, I feel like I'm disappearing. Disappearing? My skin's coming off! I'm getting old! Nothing makes any sense to me! You're not getting old. Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense. Ohh, Tangerine. Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense, Patrick. It's okay. It's okay. Hey, let's go out dancing. Yeah? You wanna go out to Montauk with me? Montauk? Yeah. No! Come up to Boston with me. Sure. Yeah. We can go next weekend. No, no. Now. Now. Yeah. I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles now. Hi, it's Joel. Um, leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you. Pick up! Pick up, man! W-W-W-W-Whoa. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Hello? Yeah, what's up? I got into a little situation with the old lady. Can you handle things tonight alone? I'm really sorry, man. Don't worry about it. I got it under control, man. He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway. Thanks, Stan. I owe you big-time. Dude, I gotta go. I gotta go. Charles. Come on, Charles. ""Look! You and me on the Charles River. I could die right now, Clem. I'm just happy. I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want..."" I'm so excited. Yea. I'm excited too! Cool. Oh, uh, I, uh... I got you this... What? thing, um... Happy early Valentine's Day. Oh! Wow. What is it? Uh, I don't know. Open it up. Oh. It... It's gorgeous! - You like it? - Yeah. It's just my taste. Really. I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked. Thank you. Let's go. Okay. Joely? Yeah, Tangerine? Am I ugly? Mm-mmm. When I was a kid, I thought I was. Can't believe I'm crying already. Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely it is to be a kid. Like you don't matter. So, I'm eight... and I have these toys, these dolls. My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine. And I keep yelling at her: ""You can't be ugly! Be pretty!"" It's weird. Like if I can transform her, I would magically change too. You're pretty. Joely, don't ever leave me. Pretty. Pretty. Pretty. Pretty. Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory. Just this one. I don't wanna hold your hand. Come on. Whoo! Whoa! Stop it! I could die right now, Clem. I'm just... happy. I've never felt that before. Mmm. I'm just exactly... where I wanna be. Clem? I wanna call it off. I'll give you a sign. I wanna call it off! Can you hear me? I don't want this anymore! I wanna call it off! Is anybody there? Clementine? Joel? Clement... Joely? Clem! Joel? Clem! What? We gotta go. We gotta go. What? Where? I have an idea of how to stop this. Stop what? Joely. Come on, Clem. Smell my armpit! Smell my armpit! No! Don't tickle me! Don't make me smell you. Smell my pits! No. Good. Concentrate, Clem. We gotta get back to the office. There was a tape recorder. No, not the picture. Not the picture. Where is it? Back here. Come on! Oh, look at me. Hey, I look good there. Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can't show you evidence. Suffice it to say that Miss, uh... Miss Kruczynski... was not happy and she wanted to move on. Good. Now, tell me about Clementine. Just tell me everything you remember. That's what he said. Then... What did we see that day? No, wait. Oh, look! Hey! Shit! We're going to see my grandma. Joel, why... No, I don't want to... Joel, please! We're not going on a train. Don't make me run anymore. Come on! Mierzwiak! Do we always have to run? Mierzwiak! Please. So, why don't we begin by you telling me... everything you can remember. Mierzwiak! Wake me up! Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish. I thought you understood what was going on here. I don't know. You're erasing her from me. You're erasing me from her... I don't know. You've got this thing. I'm in my bed. I know it. I'm in my brain. I'm part of your imagination too, Joel. How can I help you from there? Uh, I'm inside your head too. I'm you. Sorry. Look. Who's that? Oh, he-he works for us. That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick, baby boy. He's stealing my identity. He stole my stuff. He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things. He stole her underwear. Oh, Jesus Christ! He stole her underwear. I could die right now, Clem. I'm just happy. I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want to be. I want to go home. Hey. What? Clem! Wait. Clem! Clem? They're erasing you. I'm here! Clem, focus. I hired them, okay? I'm so stupid. Sweetie, calm down. Enjoy the scenery. I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore. Okay, well, you know, just tell them to cancel it then. What the hell are you talking about? I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep. Wake yourself up! Okay. You want me to wake up? Okay. Great. All right. Okay, here we go. This make you happy if I try? Yeah. I'll try really hard. Here we go. That was a great idea. Yeah. Okay. Boy, that's working like gangbusters. Don't! That tickles me! Oh, my goodness. Oh, my God. What is that? Jesus Christ! What the... It's a birthmark! It did work, for a second, but I couldn't... I couldn't move. See? Oh, well, isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies? It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually... Look, I don't want to discuss this right now, okay? Fine. Then what? I'm listening. I don't know. You erased me. That's why I'm here. That's why I'm doing this in the first place. I'm sorry. You... You! You know me. I'm impulsive. That's what I love about you. Joel? Mm-hmm? I have another idea for this problem. This is a memory of me, the way you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch. What? Joel, the eraser guys are coming here, so what if you take me somewhere else, somewhere where I don't belong, and we hide there till morning? Oh, man. I can't remember anything without you. Tsk, that's very sweet, but try, okay? Okay. It's working! I'm a genius! Joel? Joel? Where'd you go? I'm supposed to come too! Listen, I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl. Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel? Sure. He just likes to be near me. Absolutely! Clem? It worked. My God, look at this! Wow! It worked! Look! Look at this dress, man! Oh, my God! Look at it! I wish I could take it with me. Who am I? Mrs. Hamlyn. Right. Mrs. Hamlyn. I must be about four. Oh, my gosh. Found the salad bowl, so I'm serving salad and string beans. Is he okay under there? Peanut, are you all right? God, honestly, I feel like I could clean up all day. Listen, would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans? No, not at all. Oh, my God. I love this kitchen. Thank you so much. She's not looking at me. She's busy. She's not looking at me. No one ever looks at me. I want my mommy. Oh, baby Joel. Hey, Joely! Joely! Is every little peanut under there okay? Mm-hmm! He's fine. Do you have something to drink? Would you drink a cocktail at this hour? I mean, I know it's not 5:00. I would die for a vodka. Oh, hang on. Let me check if I have that. Okay! I'm just gonna wait right here. Joel! Hey, no, sweetie. Uh, Joely. Your mother wants me to mind you. Get back under the table. Ice cream. Ice cream. No, not until after, you know, you've had your dinner. Come on, Joel! Joel, grow up! Don't leave me, Clem. Oh, my God, Clem. This is sort of warped. I'm scared. I want my mommy! Don't cry, baby Joel. Baby Joel, it's okay. Joel. Joely. Joel! Stop it! Look, I think it's working. Look, we're hidden, Joel. Look! Hey, honey, look. Wait there. My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it. Yuck. It stopped. What? It stopped erasing. Oh, shit. This is terrible. He's off the map. He's off the map. Where? I don't know where! What do you mean? I don't know where! This is bad. This is very, very bad news. Where are my glasses? Okay. Crap. Okay. What do we do? What do I do? What shall we do? I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. - What shall we do? - Crap. Crap. I don't know! - I just said that I don't know what to do. - I'm sorry. What do we do? I don't know. Now, look, you're freaking me out. Mellow out. Well, you have to do something. He could wake up all half-baked. Quiet. You're freaking me out. Shh. Shh. All gooey and... and half-baked. Hmm, that sounds so good. Oh, shit! I'm hungry. Oh, shit. Oh! Oh! What? Oh! What, what? What? - We should call Howard. - No way. No, sir, man. This is my... I can handle this. I can't call Howard. He's an unbaked cookie. He's... There's no time to fuck around. I got this under control. What are you talking about? Stop fucking around! Okay, I'll call Howard. Hello. Hello, Howard? Hey, it's Stan. Um, I'm working on this guy down here, and we seem to have lost him for a moment, and, uh, I can't... I can't bring him back up. Okay, uh, tell me what happened before he disappeared. Well, I wasn't sure, really, 'cause I was away from the monitor for a minute... and I had it on autopilot because I had to, uh... I had to pee. Where's Patrick? Patrick? Patrick had to go home sick. Ah, geez. Okay, what's the address? I know. I'm so sorry. That's okay. Come on. I'm at South Village. Yeah. Apartment E. Rockville Center. Mary? He's coming right now. Yeah? I'm staying. - Get your stuff, Mary. - I'm staying. I think you should go. Hell, no. Mary... Shit. I am so stoned. Please, Mary. You have to go. Stop being stoned, Mary. I don't want him to see me stoned. Mary, you have no idea how much trouble we're gonna get into if Howard comes... I look like shit! Joely, stop it! Joel! Look! Hey, Joel! Joel! I want her to pick me up. It's weird how strong that desire is. Joel, look at me! Look. You'll remember me in the morning, and you'll come to me, and you'll tell me about us, and we'll start over. Pat? I just... Pat? I thought we could have a little cocktail. That Patrick guy... he's copying me. What Patrick guy? That guy! What? He's here in my apartment. He's one of those eraser guys. He fell for you when they were doing you, and now he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you, and you guys are dating. Really? Is he cute? Clem, there's nothing wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met. You... You're kind, beautiful... and smart and funny... and... nice. What? Okay. All right. Okay. Oh! Move, move, move! Come on. Let's go. Careful, careful. Fine. Oh, my God. I'm still stoned. Those eyedrops you gave me didn't do shit. Be cool. Cool. Hello, Mary. What are you doing here? Oh, hi, Howard. She was just here to help out. I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible. I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings... of the work that we do. Well, not that I do, but the work that is done... by people... where I also work, the work of my colleagues. All right, well, let's see if we can, uh, get to the bottom of this, shall we? Uh, yeah. Um... Well, that's odd. I already tried that. Did you try going through the C-gate? Yeah, of course. I mean... yes. Yeah. All right. You want to get linked up? Yeah. All right. I already... I ran the utility programs, and I had nothing there, so I checked all the memories against the printed logs. Here, Howard. Okay. I got you a chair. There you go. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Whew! All right, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go through the entire memory, see if something comes up. I love being bathed in the sink. Such a feeling of security. I've never seen you happier, baby Joel. Hmm! There it is. I don't understand why it's off the map like that. What the heck was he doing there? His eyes are open. - Has this happened before with him? - No. Oh, this is... this is not good. No. I'm gonna have to... I'm gonna have to give him this. Can't you see I love you, Antoine? Okay, we're back in. Wow. That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something. Thank you, Mary. Um, Howard, you should get some sleep. I-I think I'll be fine now. Why can't you see I love you, Antoine? Hmm. Lucky me. Lay one on me. Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally. Yes, I know, but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally? Oh! Oh! What was that? Hey. My God, there's people coming out of your butt. There is? - Got it. - Tangerine! What, Joel... What are you doing? We gotta go. Go on. Please, please, go. Please go! You can run, but you can't hide. Clem, come on! There I am. That truck. Doc? Please. All right, let's begin by you telling me... everything you remember... That's strange. He's in a memory that we've already erased. Oh, well, at least we know where he is. He's back on track, right? Come on, Clem. He seems to have developed some sort of resistance to the procedure. I don't want to run anymore. Shit. Come on, come on. Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried. Where? Hide me in your humiliation. Humiliation. Come on, you big baby! I'm sorry, okay? Let me drive you home. No! - Bye, Howard. - No, wait. Howard. He's disappeared again. Oh, dear. I'm so sorry, Howard. Humiliation. Humiliation. Hu-mi-lia... Joel. I don't like it either. I'm just trying to find horrible secret places to... Joel, honey, I have a surprise... I just... Oh, um... Uh, you know what, honey? I'm just gonna ask you in the morning. Good night, sweetheart. No. I'm sorry, Joel. Joely. Shut up. Look! Joel! Joel, look! What? Look where we are! Whoo! Clem, this isn't good. Then hide me somewhere... somewhere really buried. Hit it! Hit it! I can't! I gotta go home. I'll do it later! Come on, you big sissy! Ooh! Ooh, he has a girlfriend! Wait. What am I doing? You know something, Freddy? And he loves her! You don't scare me anymore. Ow! Ow! Joel! Joely, get up. Come on, it's not worth it. Hit him! Hit him! They're not worth it, Joel! Tra-la-la-la-la! He's not listening! Come on, Joel. Stupid! I'm so ashamed. It's okay. You were a little kid. Yeah? Come on. That's where I live... lived. I wish I knew you when I was a kid. Do you like my pink hat? Here, look, feel better. You can really kill me this time. It's my turn. Go. One, two, three. I can? You're really gonna die though. Okay. One, two, three. You're dead. Oh, my mom. It's... It's okay. We're playing. Hi, Joel's mom. He's killing me. It's not real. Okay, are you dead yet? You're dead! Uh, I think I got the hang of this. I still don't understand it, but I'm finding him quickly enough. Clem! Clem! Jo... Joely? Are you okay, Joel? Joel? Joel? Oh, my God. That was terrible. Okay, okay. That was like three seconds. All right. Let me do it one more time. One more, then I get to go. Okay. Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Look at this. This is so cool! Cool. Look out! Look out! Ah! Shit! It's fluff. Our house! Come on. Whoo-hoo! Come on. Come on. We gotta go! Whoo! Come on! We gotta go. Clem? We gotta go. Aah! Come on! No! This is a really bad time for this! Get off me! Oh, God! I don't even know where we're going. It's gonna be fun. Come on. It's the best place. No, this way. No, this way. No, no, no. This way. You're no help at all. What's wrong with you? Let go of me, Joel! I like watching you work, Howard. I guess, uh... I guess I'll go out for... for some air, if nobody minds. It looks like you have everything under control here. Yeah, that's, uh... that's fine. Do you like quotes, Howard? What do you mean? Oh, you know, like famous quotes? I find reading them inspirational, and in my reading, I've come across some I thought you might like too. Oh, well, I... I'd love to hear some. There's one that goes, ""Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."" That's Nietzsche, right? Yeah. And here I thought I could tell you something you didn't know. Oh, no. It's... It's a good quote. I'm happy we both know it. Yeah. Oh, and there's this other one I like. It's by Pope Alexander, and it goes... Alexander Pope? Oh, yeah. Yeah, shit. It's just that I told myself not to say ""Pope Alexander"" and sound like a dope, and then I go ahead and say it. It's no big deal. You're such a sweetheart. The quote goes, ""How happy is the blameless vestal's lot? ""The world forgetting, by the world forgot. ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned."" I want to be a great big, huge elephant... with a huge trunk like that. Clem? Clementine? I haven't heard that one. It's lovely. I just thought it would be appropriate, maybe. I really admire the work you do, Howard. I don't mean to be so familiar. Oh, it's fine. It's fine. I- I- I- I- I... I'm happy to hear... I'm sorry. I've loved you for a very long time. I shouldn't have said that. Oh, Mary, no. It's... You're a wonderful girl. But I... You know, I have a wife and kids. You know I have a wife and kids. Oh, Mary. Oh, Mary, we can't do this. Oh, whoa. Well, good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak. What? Oh, my God! Who is it? Uh... Thank you, Stan. Thanks a lot. Hollis. Hollis! Hollis! Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Hollis. - I knew it, Howard. - Hollis, it didn't start out to be like this. I came here to work. Hollis, this is a one-time mistake! I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush! Yeah. I swear I basically forced him into it! Don't be a monster, Howard. Tell the girl. Tell me what? Oh, you poor kid. You can have him. You did. What? Oh, uh, we have a history. I'm sorry. Y-You wanted the procedure. You... You wanted it done... so you could get past, uh... You could... Yeah. Um, I have to, uh, finish the work in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later. Okay? Hey. Let me give you a lift home. Fuck this thing. Damn it. Hi. Hi. Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again. I guess I thought you were... humiliated. You did run away, after all. I just needed to see ya. Yeah? I'd like to, um, take you out or something. You're married. Not yet. Not married. No, I'm not married, no. Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance, so I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage... or whatever it is you've got going there. If you wanna be with me, you're with me. Okay. Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive. But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours. I remember that speech really well. I had you pegged, didn't I? You had the whole human race pegged. Hmm. Probably. I still thought you were gonna save my life, even after that. Mmm. I know. It would be different... if we could just give it another go around. Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can. Okay, so just tell me what you remember, and, uh, then we'll take it from there. Okay. I liked you immediately. You didn't come on to me at all. I liked that. I was so tongue-tied around you at first. I wanted you to think I was smart. I couldn't wait to come to work. I had these fantasies of us being married... and having kids and... just... Oh, Howie, I can't do this. We agreed it's for the best, Mary. Yeah, I know. Oh, God. I'll take the bottom and you... Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here. I can take that. So you want me to carry that? Help me with that. Can you get the cooler? Honey, the cooler is... That's light, huh? Oh, I can get that. You can get it. No, no, no, no! Don't take anything. I can take the plane. Put the thing up. Put the gate back up. This is the day we met. You were down by the surf. I could just make you out in the distance. I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, ""Wow, how odd. I'm drawn to someone's back."" You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well... and even hate, eventually. At the time I thought, ""How cool! An orange sweatshirt."" Hi there. Hi. I saw you sitting over here... by yourself, and I thought, ""Thank God. Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either."" Yeah. I don't ever know what to say. I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken? And then you just took it... without waiting for an answer. It was so intimate, like we were already lovers. I'm Joel. Hi, Joel. So, no jokes about my name. You mean like... Huckleberry Hound, that sort of thing? Yeah. Like that. Oh, no jokes. No jokes. One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. Oh. I think your name is magical. This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon. I know. What do we do? Enjoy it. You married? No. Let's move into this neighborhood! I do sort of live with someone though. Male or female? What? Female. Female. At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree. You know these people? No, of course not. Come on. They might have a dog. There's no dog. What are you doing? It's freezing out. I can't believe this. Hoo-hoo! - Clementine! - There we go. Whoo-hoo! Come on, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight. Believe me. It's dark. So, uh, what's your girlfriend's name? Naomi, but we're not really... I mean... We're... Whatever. So this is great. Now I can look for, um, candles, matches... and the liquor cabinet. Oh, God. I think we should go. There's no phone line. What? I think we should go. Why? It's our house... just for tonight. We are ""David and Ruth Laskin."" Which one do you want to be? Uh... I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible. What are you do... Alcohol! Oh, boy. So, are you okay with wine? I don't know. Well, you choose the wine. I'm gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more... Ruth. I'm Ruth-less at the moment. I really should go. I've gotta catch my ride. So go. I did. I thought maybe you were a nut, but you were exciting. I wish you'd stayed. I wish I'd stayed too. Now I wish I'd stayed. I wish I'd done a lot of things. Oh, God, I wish I had... I wish I'd stayed. I do. Well, I came back downstairs, and you were gone. I walked out. I walked out the door. Why? I don't know. I felt like a scared little kid. I was like... It was above my head. I don't know. You were scared? Yeah. Thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think. Was it something I said? Yeah. You said, ""So go""... with such disdain, you know? Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay. Joely? What if you stayed this time? I walked out the door. There's no memory left. Come back and make up a good-bye, at least. Let's pretend we had one. Bye, Joel. I love you. Meet me in Montauk. I didn't crash the plane. The plane crashed. I didn't crash the plane. You were operating the plane with the remote control, and then it crashed. It was fucking windy. Come on, man. You're stoned, and you're driving. Yeah, the pot balances it out. The pot brings you back up. That's why I smoke it. If I'm going to be drinking, then I'll smoke it. It does. That's a medical fact. It was proven on the Science Network. Honey, just watch the road. I can't see shit. I saw you talking to somebody pretty. She was nice. Yeah, man. Who was that? She was, um, just a girl. Okay. So I gotta... I gotta drop the van off. Thanks, Stan. Thanks. We'll talk. Hey! Hey. You got a lot of your stuff there, I see. Yeah, that's right. My stuff. I take it you're not coming back. I wouldn't come back if I was you either. Do you swear you didn't know? I-I swear. So you didn't do the erasing? Of course not. God, no. And you never even suspected we were together? Once, maybe. I was coming back from a job, and you were at his car. I saw you two talking. So I waved to you, and you giggled, you know. How'd I look? You looked happy. Happy with a secret. And after that? I never saw you two together again like that, so I just... I don't know. I just figured I was imagining things. Aah! Montauk train now boarding on track ""B."" All aboard. I really like you, Mary Svevo. You know that? Thanks. Let me get my toothbrush. Yeah. Just... Where are you, Clem? I'm worried. La-la-la-la-la. I feel like you're mad at me, and I don't know what I did. What did I do? I love you so much. I'll do anything to make you happy. Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it. Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you're okay. Oh. Whew. Vámonos, señor. I-I had a really nice time last night. Nice? I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life... last night. That's better. This is weird. To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak. My name is Mary Svevo. ""We've met, but you don't remember me. I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased."" I have since decided that this is a horrible... Some kind of teaser ad or something. In order to correct this, I'm sending everyone's file back to them. My name is Clementine Kruczynski. I'm here to erase Joel Barish. What is this? I don't know. He's boring. Is that enough reason to erase someone? I've been thinking lately how I was before and how I am now, and it's like he changed me. I feel like I'm always pissy now. I don't like myself when I'm with him. I don't like myself anymore. I can't stand to even look at him. That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile. - That sort of wounded puppy shit he does, you know? - What are you doing? I'm not doing anything. The bloom is certainly fucking off the rose at this point. - Are you screwing with me? - No! - You are screwing with me. - Joel, I'm not! - You clearly are. - Look, let's just take a minute and... Patrick, get the fuck away. Oh, sweetheart... Get the fuck away from me! Can we talk about it? No! Get the fuck away! Joel Barish. Hey, Clementine. Hey. Nice to see you. Yeah. Yeah. Really very educated. I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated. I couldn't really talk to her about books, you know? She's more of a magazine-reading girl. Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired. Sometimes... I was embarrassed in public... Hi. because she would pronounce... library ""libary."" Hi. Libary. Libary. Look what I found. I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine, it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane. You made me look skinny. Amazing, burning meteorite... will carry you to another world where things are exciting. But what you quickly learn is that... it's really an elaborate ruse. I'm sorry I yelled at you. It's okay. So flashy in a kind of obvious way. But still, it seduces you. Joel, I really like you. I hate that I said mean things about you. - Let me turn this off, okay? - Hey, it's... it's only fair. Where's the real Clementine? I mean, the whole thing with the hair... it's all bullshit. - I really like your hair. - Thank you. I really like your hair. Thank you. I do. The world's a goddamn mess. Is it some kind of a revolt? Change your hair color. You want a drink or something? Do you have any whiskey? No, I don't think her sex is... motivated. I saw it clearly the last night we were together. It wasn't sex. It was just sad. Hey. Sorry. I thought there was more. The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her... is to fuck 'em... or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of 'em. And she's so desperate and insecure... that she'll, sooner or later, go around fucking everybody. I don't do that. I wouldn't think that about you. - Because I don't. - I know. Because it really hurts me that you said that because I don't do that. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry about all this. I'm gonna... go. I'm a little confused. I don't really think I can be here. Um... bye. Bye. I thought I knew her so well. It was nice meeting you and all. But I don't know her at all. What a loss to spend that much time with someone, only to find out that she's a stranger. Wait. What? I don't know. Just wait. Just wait. What do you want, Joel? I don't know. I want you to wait for... just a while. Okay. Really? I'm not a concept, Joel. I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind. - I'm not perfect. - I can't see anything that I don't like about you. Right now I can't. But you will. But you will. You know, you will think of things, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped... because that's what happens with me. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay."
1,2003,Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,American,"After rescuing U.S. Marshal Ray Carter (Robert Patrick) in Mongolia, the Angels: Natalie Cook (Cameron Diaz), Dylan Sanders (Drew Barrymore), and Alex Munday (Lucy Liu), together with John Bosley's adoptive brother Jimmy Bosley (Bernie Mac), are sent to recover H.A.L.O.

DOJ official William Rose Bailey (Bruce Willis) and a protected witness, Alan Caulfield (Eric Bogosian) are among those killed. At Caulfield's house in San Bernardino, the Angels track his assassin Randy Emmers (Rodrigo Santoro) to a beach where they meet with former Angel Madison Lee (Demi Moore). During the Coal Bowl motorcycle race, Emmers targets another witness named Max Petroni (Shia LaBeouf), but is killed by the Thin Man (Crispin Glover). Inside Emmers' pocket, the Angels discover the photos of Caulfield, Max, and, surprisingly, Dylan, under her birth name, Helen Zaas.
Dylan reveals that she is a protected witness after sending her former boyfriend, Irish mob leader Seamus O'Grady (Justin Theroux), to prison. O'Grady has since targeted those who wronged him, including Dylan and Max, whose parents O'Grady killed. Max is sent to the home of Bosley's mother (Ja'net Dubois) for his protection. At a monastery, the Angels learn about the Thin Man's past from the Mother Superior (Carrie Fisher). Afterward, the Angels track O'Grady's mob at San Pedro and manage to get the rings, but O'Grady threatens Dylan with the murder of everyone she loves. While Natalie attends her boyfriend, Peter Kominsky (Luke Wilson)'s high school reunion at Hermosa Beach and Alex returns home to find her action star boyfriend-under-timeout, Jason Gibbons (Matt LeBlanc) telling her awestruck father (John Cleese) about her exploits, Dylan leaves the Angels and heads to Mexico. When Natalie, Bosley and Alex notices her letter, they read her reasons for leaving them. While Alex is upset by this, Natalie understands why Dylan led to protect them. When she asks about O'Grady's break out from jail, Charlie reveals someone had him released on good behavior. While in Mexico keeping a low profile, Dylan is convinced to return after seeing an apparition of former Angel Kelly Garrett (Jaclyn Smith).
Natalie and Alex deduce that Carter is a part of O'Grady's scheme after seeing him return Bosley's keys without any pain, since he had earlier claimed to have broken his ribs, which is now proved to have been a lie. Following him, the two witness him being shot to death by Madison, the true mastermind behind all of this. Though Dylan arrives to back the group, the Angels are shot by Madison, who takes the rings, though they survive by having worn Kevlar vests beforehand. At the base, Charlie through the speakers reprimands Madison for what she's done. He confronts her for endangering the lives of her former teammates. By the time that he had rescued them, the girls were in critical condition and Madison was kicked out of the Angels for it. Madison responds by pulling out her gold guns and shooting the speaker. The Angels realize that Madison, with the protection of O'Grady, is going to sell the rings to the Antonioni Crime Family, the Tanaka Yakuza, and the Diablo Cartel at the Hollywood Walk of Fame, where Jason's film's premiere is about to commence. The Angels set the three groups up to be arrested by the FBI instead, while they confront Madison and O'Grady. The Thin Man comes to the Angels' aid, where it's revealed he's in love with Dylan and is doing his part to protect her. O'Grady kills the Thin Man, but Dylan manages to throw him down to his death. The Angels fight Madison all the way to an abandoned theater, where they kick her to a gas-filling chamber, with her dooming herself by shooting her bullets, exploding it.
The Angels attend the premiere where they learn that Mama Bosley is adopting Max. Peter postpones his engagement with Natalie by buying for them a puppy named Spike while Alex terminates her timeout with Jason. The Angels celebrate their victory together with Bosley.",4.9,tt0305357,"Northern Mongolia Get off the babysitter. Daddy's home. What is an Angel doing so far from Heaven? l'm no Angel.

Yes, you are. Don't worry, Dylan. We're still gonna be your best butties. Now, Angels, a rose by any other name still smells as sweet. Thank you, Charlie. lt's not that funny. Yeah, it is. -Bos, can l get a ruling on this one? -You sure can. You know what? Personally, l'm not interested in Helen Zaas. l'm more concerned about yours. No matter what, you're still gonna be our Dylan. -Thank you, Bos. -You're welcome. Let me guess, you fell for the bad guy. l fell for the worst guy. But he was so cute, and l liked him so much. We had so much fun together... ...just driving around, listening to metal and.... years ago And then one night, things got really bad. l love you! l would die for you, Seamus! O'Grady. You got some balls. He said he'd kill me if l told anyone, but l had to put him away. -Of course you did. -You did the right thing. -He was my first. -Really? -But you told me you never did it. -My first bust. -Yeah. -Who was this guy? -Seamus O'Grady. -O'Grady? -As in the lrish mob? -l sent him to prison.

The Thin Man. -Our favourite assassin. -That's right. -This needs to go get analysed. -Yes, let's get up in there and do that. Let me see it. Yeah, l know exactly what this is. l have one. The nuns gave it to us at the orphanage. Orphanage. -Good work. -Max is in our protective custody now. -It's up to us to k eep him safe. -Hey, l know the safest place in town. Listen, don't you worry about a thing. No O'Grady ever set foot in South Central. Can you dig it? -Yeah. -This is my mama house. Rule number one: Don't look her in the eye. Understand? Or she'll pop.

Mother superior will see you now. Mother, do you recognize this man? Of course l know who he is. We called him Anthony, after St. Anthony of Padua... ...healer of the mute. Please come forward. Please, girls. But his real name, like so much about him, was a mystery. He came to us when he was 7. He was found wandering in the hills, living off roots and insects. w e believe his family was in a Romanian circus troupe... ... who died in a terrible fire. Although the doctors could find nothing physically wrong... ...he never spok e a word. And there were other idiosyncrasies. He was a painfully shy child... ... until it came time for his monthly haircut. ... until it came time for his monthly haircut. Then one morning, he was simply gone. The Thin Man was protecting Max. So you're saying this man is the sole benefactor of your orphanage? Yes, he really is an angel. Mother, have you had contact with him since? Well, not really that much... ...except for the odd haircut now and then. But he does send gifts. Like this morning. -Emmers' car. -That is a nice ride. An original numbers-matching GTO. -Thorn Birds. -l know. Bird poo. What order did you girls say you were from again? -Larus californicus. -California gull. Fecal matter consists mostly of scaly clypeiform. Sardines that fed on large brown algae, l'd say. There's also traces of tanker fuel and storm-water runoff as well. Sea gulls, tankers, storm water. San Pedro Harbour. -Who are you? -What?! Wait. -What? -Who are you? Oh, Jason Gibbons. The actor. Maybe you've seen Maximum Extreme. No. -lt was such a big movie. -What are you doing here? -l'm Alex's boyfriend. -Alex's boyfriend. Yeah. Well, technically, we're on what she calls a time-out. -What does that mean? -Exactly. Thank you. Yeah. l gotta say, you must be the world's most understanding father. -Why? -All the wild stuff she does. When l first met Alex, l thought she was a bikini waxer. lt was months before l knew about Charlie. Who's Charlie? San Pedro Harbour Merkin. That was the name of Seamus' pit bull. Armed guards. Security looks pretty tight. This dock is like a fortress. lD badges. l think cargo's our best bet. -Townsend Agency. -Bos, recon incoming. -Got you, baby. -Yeah, check the photo. That's our man.

Who do you think invented the McRib, Lucky Charms, huh? -Shamrock Shake? That's ours. -Give me your papers. -What? -Your papers. Let me tell you... ...you got nerve to ask me about my papers. My family suffered, man, for lack of potatoes. Foot-and-mouth disease. Canker sores. Circumcision. -Circumcision? -Right, my wife just had a set of twins. -Both leprechauns. -Leprechauns? Get a whiff. lrish Spring. You don't believe that, wipe your ass with a four-leaf clover. McGinty! Get this stuff on the ship. -Tough, eh? -That was heavy. l say we should take a break. Wait a second. l smell a rat. This ring is pure platinum. The HALO rings are titanium. HALO data chips should be weightless... ...surrounded by a hollow core that prevents thermal induction. lf the density of the object... ...is less than that of the substance in which it is immersed.... lt floats. There they are. l'm sure Helen Zaas was great, but l just can't imagine life... ...without Dylan Sanders. -Come on, let's get out of here. -Cheers to that. What's the rush, Helen? What's the rush, Helen? You've only been here five minutes. Now, l've waited for you before. Matter of fact, l've waited for you days. That's weeks. That's months. That's eight years. Enough about me. What about you, Helen? How have you been? Seamus. l see you still got a nice arse on you. You got a lot of nerve stealing from me. -Stealing back's more like it. -Give us the rings. Give us the rings. Give us the rings! Don't lose those. We'll be taking them back in about... ...48 seconds. l've been dreaming one day l'd get to see you again... ...and watch you die. Keep dreaming. Lights. Somebody get the lights! Seamus. Seamus! Seamus! You know l always like it with the light on. -You don't know me anymore. -l'm the only one here who knows you. Wait, wait, wait! l've got to say, Helen, l've never wanted you more. -Always wanting what you can't have. -Yeah? l'll have you any way l want. l got the rings. Let's get out of here! Don't let them get away! Got it? Come on, now! Let's go. Dylan, let's go. You can't hurt me anymore, Helen. l'm gonna teach you and your friends about pain. l'm gonna kill them just so you can hear them scream. Dylan! l got the rings. -Are you okay? -Yeah, l'm okay. Hit it. l know who did it. Hot damn it, l know who did it. Col. Mustard, in the dining room, with a lead pipe. Col. Mustard, in the dining room, with a lead pipe. -Col. Mustard? -Give me that. -Col. Mustard? -l said, Col. Mustard... ...in the dining room, with a lead pipe. -Go ahead and look in there. -Why don't you look. Col. Must-- -Col. Mustard? -Right. Col. Mustard? Col. Mustard? lt's Professor Plum... ...in the conservatory, with a candlestick. That's right. You got it right. -Damn! -How the hell you know that? We took in one just like him a long time ago, remember? Yeah, Mama, l remember. You gave my room away. You were the cock? l was the beaver. What are the chances that we were both mascots? -Unbelievable. -Oh, God. lt's like we were made for each other. The best l can figure it is, the clients contact Charlie directly. Okay, then he phones the girls. They show up at the place and do their thing. Now, l know, l know. At first, l didn't think l could handle it. The late nights, the never knowing when she'd have to go out on a job. Some of the men are pretty dangerous. And the outfits. Oh, boy. l'll be right back, Pete. lt's just number one. Have fun. Hello? l'm gonna say this. Our boy Pete has no idea what he's getting into. l don't think he really understands the responsibility. -No, no. -Pete? -The commitment. -Once they get into your house... -...you lose all spontaneity. -Gone. They do whatever they want. -Pete's asking her tonight? -That's what he said. But Alex is a wildcat. l mean, she gives as good as she gets. Alex! Hey. Jason, Daddy. What are you doing here, Jason? l was just explaining to your father here all about Charlie. Charlie? -Daddy.... -lt's all right, darling. l know. l'm so sorry, Daddy, that l didn't tell you. l didn't think you'd approve. l know you wanted me to be a neurosurgeon. But l've discovered a whole new way to help people... ...that makes me feel so... ...alive. Whatever makes you happy. l am so relieved! lt's just been killing me, you not knowing all these years. l-- Daddy... ...Natalie, Dylan and l are a team. And we just took on sailors. You can't even imagine the positions we get ourselves into. Daddy, l wish you could watch us work. You'd be so proud. l'm gonna take a shower... ...because l am covered in-- Well, you can only imagine what. And then when l get back, l am gonna give you... ...a full blow-by-blow. Ferret. -Natalie? -What, Pete? -l've been thinking. -Yeah? -About what? -Well, look... ...l know we just moved in together. -Yeah? -Yeah. And l know we agreed to take this kind of slow. -But-- -Yeah? There's just something l gotta ask. -Oh, boy. -Yeah. 'Oh, boy' is right. So here it goes. -Twirl me first. -Okay. Yeah. Hey! -About that question, Pete? -Let's talk about it later. ' Here's all your stuff back.' What's up with that? She's gone. She's not coming back. She loved these boots. She doesn't want us to get hurt. Wait a minute, you ladies risk your ass every day. Yeah. ' l'll never forgive myself if anything happens to you.' Where do we go from here, Charlie? Natalie, Alex. You need to k eep your spirits up. Any leads on the O'Gradys, Charlie? Any word on how Seamus broke out of prison? He didn't break out, Natalie. He was released. What? Who would have the power to pull something like that off? Johnnie Cochran. The Justice Department, the DA's office, the FBl. U.S. Marshal. That's Carter. l never gave rings to a guy before. The rings are secure, sir. And we can all breathe a little easier. -w ell done, Angels. -Thanks, Charlie. HALO is safe, thanks to you. lt's been a pleasure. l hope to work with you ladies again. But not too soon. Good luck with everything. Your keys. -What is it? -My ribs. These aren't mine. That was a nice reach for a guy with a couple of fractured ribs. Good going, Bos. -We got him. -We got who? Of course, he already had one ring. He just needed the other. He wanted to fake his own death so he wouldn't be a suspect. Who you all talking about? He needed time for his plan, so he set up Seamus. Then turned him loose on Dylan. I think you're onto something, Angels. Damn! So Carter's the bad guy! It's just speculation at this point, Bosley. w e need proof. -Keys, Bosley. -Let's hit it. Punk. Road's clear. You're good to move in. Almost there. Oncoming. Good job, Alex. -Can we go yet? -No, you can't, son. l gotta make sure it's safe. -We're gonna be late. -You're not gonna be late, young ma-- You old grizzly bear! Son, please work with me, young man. A few more minutes and you'll be in school. You'll never see me again. Man, you do not mess with a black man's do! l got the phone line. l'm calling from my car. Go secure. My end of the deal's done. The Angels are off the case. I have the rings. Dylan. Alex! Alex! Call buyer one. Alex, are you okay? Nat, the handle's broken. l can't disengage. The deal's on. Eight o'clock, just as we discussed. -Nat, plan B! -l'm calling in Bosley. We'll get you out of there, Alex. Hang tight. Follow the stars beyond the galaxy. Take shore to hope. Stop on a stair. A stair? Find a man with a map. Bosley, can you hear me? Bosley, we're going to Bravo configuration immediately. l'm on it. l'm on it. Okay? Now, get back. We're going to Bravo configuration. Get back! Stop! Stop! -Come on. -Okay. Come on, hurry. Skip. Run. Get on out of here. Come on. Get on out of here. -Great job, Bos. -Yeah, right. Carter's working with a partner. They're selling the list tonight. We'll take care of them and then find Dylan. -See you, Bos. -Yeah, all right, all right. This is some bullshit. -Kelly Garrett. -Hello, Dylan. Don't you have a case to solve? Well, l tried to outrun my past, but it caught up with me yesterday. And l put my friends in danger. They're in more danger now without you. Natalie and Alex are gonna replace me with someone great. A real Angel. Not someone who's pretending to be something she's not. Your past is what makes you who you are, Dylan. Don't forget that Charlie chose you for a reason. Angels are like diamonds. They can't be made. You have to find them. Each one is unique. Sometimes we search too hard for answers that are right in front of us. The buyers are set. We did it, partner! You know, l never really got that partner thing. Hello, Angels. Madison Lee. Why? Why be an Angel when l can play God? Looks like one of the three amigos has gone adiós. Welcome back, Dylan. You're such a typical rebellious Pisces. Always out to prove how tough you are... ...and you couldn't make it one day on your own, could you? Someone reminded me that every Angel is unique. And l knew it was you. Who else had contacts in Mongolia... ...could hack the HALO fail-safe and hire a surfer as an assassin? Same astrological phenom who would refer to a motocross rider... ...with a lion on his helmet as ' Leo.' Very well done. Very impressive, really. You've got it all figured out. And now l'm gonna really enjoy... ...knocking those halos right off your heads. But you're an Angel. No. You just don't get it. l don't take orders from a speaker box anymore. l work for myself. Well, your boss sucks. The Angels' ass-kicking pose. Seeing the three of you like that... ...does give me this little twinge of nostalgia for the old days. But back then, it was a little bit different. You see, when l was an Angel... ...we used guns. Sorry, Charlie. Hello, Angels. Good evening, Charlie. l love the new office. Madison, is that you? where are the Angels? l'm sure there's three more where they came from. Madison, what have you done? We're just having a little fun. You shouldn't worry yourself, Charlie. You've never had trouble... ...finding someone to give their life for you. Hurting the Angels doesn't prove you're the best. You know that. Do l? Madison, you were never able to accept that this agency... ... is about teamwork. w e're a family. w e do-- Yeah, yeah, yeah, l know. Angels forever. l've heard the sales pitch. lt was very seductive... ...once. Madison, you deliberately went rogue on the DeSoto case... ...and put your fellow Angels in danger. when we finally got you out of there... ...you were wounded so badly, we thought we might lose you. You did lose me. You see, being an Angel wasn't fulfilling my destiny. lt was keeping me from it. Your destiny is yet to be written. Do not do this, Madison. Taking the lives of innocent people is not the answer. There must be something in you that's still good. l was never good. l was great. Damn. What a bitch! You guys, we have to outthink Madison. No matter what we do, she's always two steps ahead of us. -She's selling the list off tonight, 8:00. -But where? -Nat, what else did Carter say? -Okay. 'Take the stars beyond the galaxy.' lt's safe to say it's on this planet. 'Take shore to hope and stop on a stair.' -There's a Hope Street downtown. -But no shore for miles. A stair. Astaire! Astaire? Astaire! -Possible concussion. -l'm worried. Guys, the stars. Hollywood Walk of Fame. Beyond the Galaxy Theatre. There's Dinah Shore, Bob Hope and Fred Astaire. -Nice, Nat. -Yeah! l think she's trying to kill us. l can't believe it. We are here in Hollywood. -Angels? -l knew we were gonna do it-- -Shut up, damn it! -What? l mean, not you, Mama. Sorry. -Have you lost your mind? -Yeah. l mean, no. We gonna talk about this later.

No, Madison. l'm nothing like you. l have something you'll never have. And what's that? Friends. -Enjoy heaven. -Go to hell. She is so fired. Party time. -Angels! -Bosley!

2,2017,Coco,American,"In Santa Cecilia, Mexico, Imelda Rivera is the wife of a musician, who leaves her and their 3-year-old daughter Coco, to pursue a career in music. When he never returns, Imelda banishes music from her life and that of her family and starts a shoemaking business with her family.
About 96 years later, Imelda's great-great-grandson, 12-year-old Miguel, now lives with Coco and their family. Miguel secretly dreams of becoming a musician like Ernesto de la Cruz, a popular actor and singer of Coco's generation. One day, Miguel inadvertently damages the picture frame holding a photo of Coco with her parents at the center of the family ofrenda and removes the photograph, discovering that his great-great-grandfather (whose face had been torn out) was holding Ernesto's famous guitar.
Concluding that Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather, Miguel leaves to enter a talent show for the Day of the Dead despite the objections of his grandmother Elena. He enters Ernesto's mausoleum and takes his guitar to use in the show, but becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza. However, he can interact with his Xoloitzcuintli dog Dante and his skeletal dead relatives who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him there, they realize that Imelda cannot visit, as Miguel removed her photo from the ofrenda. Discovering that he is cursed for stealing from the dead, Miguel must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise or he will become one of the dead; to do so, he must receive a blessing from a member of his family using an Aztec marigold petal that can undo the curse placed upon him when he stole Ernesto's guitar. Imelda offers Miguel a blessing, but on the condition that he abandon his musical pursuits when he returns to the Land of the Living. Miguel refuses and attempts to seek Ernesto's blessing.
Miguel encounters Héctor, a down-on-his-luck skeleton who once played music with Ernesto, and offers to help Miguel reach him. In return, Héctor asks Miguel to take his photo back to the Land of the Living so he can visit his daughter before she forgets him and he disappears completely. Upon learning he has other relatives, however, Héctor attempts to return Miguel to them, but Miguel escapes and infiltrates Ernesto's mansion, learning along the way that an old friendship between the two deteriorated before Héctor's death. Ernesto welcomes Miguel as his descendant, but Héctor confronts them, imploring Miguel to take his photo to the Land of the Living. After an argument between Ernesto and Héctor, Miguel soon realizes that Ernesto murdered Héctor using a poisoned drink and stole the songs Héctor had written, passing them off as his own to become famous.
To maintain his legacy, Ernesto steals the photo and has Miguel and Héctor thrown into a cenote pit. Miguel realizes that Héctor is his actual great-great-grandfather and that Coco is Héctor's daughter, the only living person who still remembers him. With the help of Dante – who turns into an alebrije – the dead Riveras find and rescue the duo. Miguel reveals that Héctor's decision to return home to Imelda and Coco resulted in his death, and Imelda and Héctor gradually reconcile. They infiltrate Ernesto's sunrise concert to retrieve Héctor's photo from Ernesto and his crimes are revealed to everyone. Ernesto is crushed by a falling church bell as in his previous life, but Héctor's photo falls into the water and disappears.
As the sun rises, Héctor is in danger of being forgotten by Coco and disappearing. Imelda and Héctor bless Miguel with no conditions attached so he can return to the Land of the Living to try and help Coco remember her father. Miguel plays ""Remember Me"", a song Héctor wrote for her during her childhood. The song revitalizes her memory of Héctor, and she gives Miguel the torn-out piece of the photo from the ofrenda, which shows Héctor's face, and tells her family stories about her father, thus keeping the memory of him alive. Elena reconciles with Miguel, accepting music back into the family.
One year later, Miguel proudly presents the family ofrenda – including the restored photo of Héctor and Imelda – to his new baby sister Socorro as Elena adds a photo of the now-deceased Coco. Letters kept by Coco contain evidence that Ernesto stole Héctor's songs. As a result, Ernesto's legacy is destroyed, and the community honors Héctor instead. In the Land of the Dead, Héctor and Imelda join Coco for a visit to the living Riveras as Miguel sings and plays for his dead and living relatives.",8.4,tt2380307," explosiveskull  GoldenBeard Sometimes, I think I'm cursed. Because of something that happened before I was even born. See, a long time ago, there was this family. The papa, he was a musician. He and his family would sing and dance and count their blessings. But he also had a dream. To play for the world. And one day, he left with his guitar and never returned. And the mama... She didn't have time to cry over that walk-away musician. After banishing all music from her life she found a way... to provide for her daughter. She rolled up her sleeves and she learned to make shoes. She could have made candy, or fireworks, or sparkly underwear... for wrestlers, but no, she chose shoes. Then she taught her daughter to make shoes. And later, she taught her son-in-law. Then her grandkids got roped in. As her family grew, so did the business. Music had torn her family apart. But shoes held them all together. You see, that woman was my great-great-grandmother, Mama Imelda. She died way before I was born. But my family still tells her story every year on Dia de los Muertos... the Day of the Dead. And her little girl, she's my great-grandmother, Mama Coco. Hola, Mama Coco. How are you, Julio? Actually, my name is Miguel. Mama Coco has trouble remembering things. But it's good to talk to her anyway. So, I tell her pretty much everything. I used to run like this. But now I run like this which is way faster. And the winner is Luchadora Coco! I have a dimple on this side, but not on this side. Dimple, no dimple. Dimple, no dimple. Miguel, eat your food. My abuelita, she's Mama Coco's daughter. Oh, you're a twig, mijo. Have some more. No, gracias. I asked if you would like more tamales! Si? That's what I thought you said! Abuelita runs our house just like Mama Imelda did. No music! No music!  Y aunque la vida  No music! I think we're the only family in Mexico who hates music. And my family's fine with that. But me... - Be back by lunch, mijo. - Love you, Mama. I am not like the rest of my family! - Hola, Miguel! - Hola! - Muchas gracias. - De nada, Miguel. Hey! Dante! Sit. Down. Roll over. Shake. Fist bump! Good boy, Dante! I know I'm not supposed to love music. But it's not my fault! It's his! Ernesto de la Cruz. The greatest musician of all time. Right here in this very plaza, Ernesto de la Cruz took his first steps... toward becoming the most beloved singer in Mexican history. He started out a total nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me. But when he played music, he made people fall in love with him. He starred in movies. He had the coolest guitar! He could fly! And he wrote the best songs. But my all-time favorite, it's...  Remember me  Remember me  Though I have to say goodbye -  Remember me -  Remember me  Don't let it make you cry For even if I'm far away  I hold you in my heart I sing a secret song to you  Each night we are apart Remember me  Though I have to travel far -  Remember me -  Remember me  Each time you hear a sad guitar  Know that I'm with you the only way that I can be  Until you're in my arms again  He lived the kind of life you dream about. Until 1942. When he was crushed by a giant bell. I want to be just like him. Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and I get this feeling like we're connected. Like if he could play music, maybe someday, I could too. If it wasn't for my family. - Ay-ay-ay, muchacho. - Huh? I asked for a shoe shine not your life story. Oh, yeah. Sorry. I just can't really talk about any of this at home. So... If I were you, I'd march right up to my family and say... ""Hey, I'm a musician. Deal with it."" I could never say that. You are a musician, no? I don't know. I mean, I only really play for myself. Ah! Did de la Cruz become the world's best musician by hiding his skills? No! He walked out onto that plaza and he played out loud. Mira, mira, they're setting up for tonight! The music competition for Dia de Muertos. You want to be like your hero? You should sign up! Uh-uh. My family would freak! Look, if you're too scared then, well, have fun making shoes. Come on, what did de la Cruz always say? Seize your moment? Show me what you got, muchacho. I'll be your first audience. Miguel! - Abuelita! - What are you doing here? You leave my grandson alone. Dona, please! I was just getting a shine. I know your tricks, mariachi. What did he say to you? He was just showing me his guitar. Shame on you. My grandson is a sweet little angelito querido cielito. He wants no part of your music, mariachi. You keep away from him. Ay, pobrecito. Oh, estas bien, mijo. You know better than to be here in this place! You will come home. Now. How many times have we told you? That plaza is crawling with mariachis. Yes, Tio Berto. - No, no, no, no, no! - Ah! Go away, you. Go! It's just Dante. Never name a street dog. They'll follow you forever. Now, go get my shoe. I found your son in Mariachi Plaza. Ay, Miguel! You know how Abuelita feels about the plaza. I was just shining shoes. A musician's shoes! But the plaza's where all the foot traffic is. If Abuelita says no more plaza, then no more plaza. - But what about tonight? - What's tonight? Well, they're having this talent show. And I thought I might... - Sign up? - Well, maybe? You have to have talent to be in a talent show. What are you gonna do? Shine shoes? It's Dia de los Muertos. No one's going anywhere. Tonight is about family. Ofrenda room. Vamonos. Don't give me that look. Dia de los Muertos is the one night of the year our ancestors can come visit us. We've put their photos on the ofrenda so their spirits can cross over. That is very important. If we don't put them up, they can't come. We made all this food, set out the things they loved in life, mijo. All this work to bring the family together. I don't want you sneaking off to who knows where. Where are you going? I thought we were done. Ay, Dios mio. Being part of this family means being here for this family. I don't want to see you end up like... Like Mama Coco's papa? Never mention that man! He's better off forgotten. But you're the one who... I was just... But... I... Papa? Papa is home? Mama, calmese, calmese. Papa is coming home? No, Mama. It's okay. I'm here. Who are you? Rest, Mama. I'm hard on you because I care, Miguel. Miguel? Miguel? What are we going to do with that boy? You're right. That's just what he needs. It's you. Get in here. Come on, Dante. Hurry up! You're gonna get me in trouble, boy. Someone could hear me. I wish someone wanted to hear me. Other than you. Ew. Okay. Perfecto! I have to sing. I have to play! The music, it's not just in me, it is me. When life gets me down, I play my guitar. The rest of the world may follow the rules, but I must follow my heart. Ugh! You know that feeling like there's a song in the air and... it's playing just for you?  A feeling so close...  You could reach out and touch it  I never knew  I could want something so much, but it's true  You must have faith, sister. Oh, but, Padre, he will never listen. He will listen. To music.  Only a song, only a song  Has the power to change a heart  Never underestimate the power of music. But my father, he will never give his permission. I am done asking permission. When you see your moment, you mustn't let it pass you by. You must seize it! Senor de la Cruz, what did it take for you to seize your moment? I had to have faith in my dream. No one was going to hand it to me. It was up to me to reach for that dream. Grab it tight and make it come true. ...and make it come true. No more hiding, Dante. I got to seize my moment! I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza if it kills me. Dia de los Muertos has begun! No, no. We have to make a clear path. The petals guide our ancestors home. We don't want their spirits to get lost. We want them to come and enjoy all the food and drinks on the ofrenda. Mama! Where should we put this table? In the courtyard, mijos. You want it down by the kitchen? Si. Next to the other one. - Get under! Get under! - Miguel? Nothing! Mama, Papa. I... Miguel, your abuelita had the most wonderful idea. We've all decided. It's time you joined us in the workshop! - What? - No more shining shoes. You'll be making them every day after school. Oh! Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to carrying on the family tradition. And on Dia de los Muertos! Your ancestors will be so proud. You'll craft huaraches just like your Tia Victoria. And wingtips like your Papa Julio. But what if I'm no good at making shoes? Ah, Miguel. You have your family here to guide you. You are a Rivera. And a Rivera is... A shoemaker. Through and through. That's my boy! Berto! Break out the good stuff. I want to make a toast. Dante! No, Dante. Stop! No, no, no, no, no! No. De la Cruz's guitar? Papa? Papa? Mama Coco, is your papa Ernesto de la Cruz? Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! It's him! I know who my great-great-grandfather was. Miguel, get down from there. Mama Coco's father was Ernesto de la Cruz! What are you talking about? I'm gonna be a musician! What is all this? You keep secrets from your own family? It's all that time he spends in the plaza. Fills his head with crazy fantasies. It's not a fantasy. That man was Ernesto de la Cruz! The greatest musician of all time! We've never known anything about this man! But whoever he was, he still abandoned his family. This is no future for my son. But, Papa, you said my family would guide me. Well, de la Cruz is my family. I'm supposed to play music. Never! That man's music was a curse. I will not allow it. - If you would just let... - Miguel... You will listen to your family. No more music. - Just listen to me play! - End of argument. You want to end up like that man? Forgotten? Left off your family's ofrenda? I don't care if I'm on some stupid ofrenda. - No! - Mama! There. No guitar. No music. Oh, come. You'll feel better after you eat with your family. I don't want to be in this family! Miguel! Miguel! I want to play in the plaza, like de la Cruz. Can I still sign up? You got an instrument? No. But if I can borrow a guitar... Musicians got to bring their own instruments. You find a guitar, kid, I'll put you on the list. - Can I borrow your guitar? - Sorry, muchacho. - You guys have a spare guitar? - No. I need a guitar just for a little bit. Get out of here, kid. Great-great-grandfather, what am I supposed to do? No, no, no, no. Dante, stop! Callate! Shh! I'm sorry. Senor de la Cruz, please don't be mad. I'm Miguel. Your great-great grandson. I need to borrow this. Our family thinks music is a curse. None of them understand but I know you would have. You would have told me to follow my heart. To seize my moment! So, if it's all right with you, I'm gonna play in the plaza. Just like you did! The guitar! It's gone! Somebody stole de la Cruz's guitar! The window's broken. Look! All right, who's in there? I'm sorry. It's not what it looks like. De la Cruz is my... There's nobody here. - Miguel! - Mama! Miguel, come home. Where are you, Miguel? Dios mio! Little boy. Are you okay? Here. Let me help you. Thanks. I... Do you mind? Whoa! Look how big she's getting. Dante! You can see me? Wait! What's going on? Dante! - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Miguel? - Miguel? - Miguel? You're here? Here, here. And you can see us? Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to! Remind me how I know you. We're your family, mijo. - Tia Rosita? - Si. - Papa Julio? - Hola. Tia Victoria? He doesn't seem entirely dead. He's not quite alive either. We need Mama Imelda. She'll know how to fix this. Oye! It's Mama Imelda. She couldn't cross over. - She's stuck! - On the other side! Tio Oscar? Tio Felipe? Oh. Hey, Miguel. I have a feeling this has something to do with you. But if Mama Imelda can't come to us... Then we are going to her. Vamonos! Whoa. Come on, Miguel. It's okay. Dante? Dante! Dante, wait up! You got to stay with me, boy. We don't know... where... This isn't a dream then. You're all really out there. - You thought we weren't? - Well, I don't know. I thought it might've been one of those made up things that adults tell kids. Like vitamins. Miguel, vitamins are a real thing. Well, now I'm thinking maybe they could be. Mija, it's not nice to stare at... Ay! Santa Maria! Are those... Alebrijes! But those are... Real alebrijes. Spirit creatures. They guide souls on their journey. Watch your step. They make caquitas everywhere. Welcome back to the Land of the Dead. Please have all offerings ready for re-entry. Welcome back. Anything to declare? Some churros. From my family. How wonderful. Next. If you are experiencing travel issues, agents at the Department of Family... Reunions are available to assist you. Next family, please. Oh! Your photos are on your son's ofrenda. Have a great visit. Gracias. And remember to return before sunrise. Enjoy your visit. Next. Your photo's on your dentist's ofrenda. Enjoy your visit. - Gracias. - Next? Yes! It is I. Frida Kahlo. Shall we skip the scanner? I'm on so many ofrendas it'll just overwhelm your blinky thingy. Well, shoot, looks like no one put up your photo, Frida. Okay, when I said I was Frida, just now, that was a lie. And I apologize for doing that. No photo on an ofrenda, no crossing the bridge. I'm just gonna zip right over. You won't even know I'm gone. Hey! Almost... there. Just a little further. Upsy-daisy... Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares? Dumb flower bridge! Aw. I don't know what I'd do if no one put up my photo. - Next? - Oh! Come, mijo. It's our turn. Welcome back, amigos. Anything to declare? As a matter of fact, yes. Hola. Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos. Please report to Level Seven. Whoa! I miss my nose. Come on, help us out, amigo. We got to get to a dozen ofrendas tonight. We are not visiting your ex-wife's family for Dia de Muertos! I demand to speak to the person in charge! I'm sorry, senora, it says here no one put up your photo. My family always puts my photo on the ofrenda. That devil box tells you nothing but lies! - Mama Imelda? - Oh, mi familia! They wouldn't let me cross the bridge. Tell this woman and her devil box that my photo is on the ofrenda. Well, we never made it to the ofrenda. - What? - We ran into... - Miguel? - Mama Imelda. What is going on? You the Rivera family? Well, you're cursed. What? Dia de los Muertos is the night to give to the dead. You stole from the dead! But I wasn't stealing the guitar. Guitar? It was my great-great-grandfather's. He would have wanted me to have it. Ah, ah, ah. We do not speak of that musician. He is dead to this family. Uh, you're all dead. I am sorry. Whose alebrije is that? That's just Dante. He sure doesn't look like an alebrije. He just looks like a plain old dog. Or a sausage someone dropped in a barbershop. Whatever he is, I am terribly allergic. But Dante doesn't have any hair. And I don't have a nose, and yet, here we are. But none of this explains why I couldn't cross over. Oh! You took my photo off the ofrenda? - It was an accident! - How do we send him back? Well, since it's a family matter... the way to undo a family curse - is to get your family's blessing. - That's it? Get your family's blessing and everything should go back to normal. But you got to do it by sunrise. What happens at sunrise? Hijole! Your hand! Whoa, Miguel, can't have you fainting on us. But not to worry. Your family's here. You can get your blessing right now. Cempasuchil, cempasuchil. Aha! Perdon, senora. Oh. Now, you look at the living and say his name. Miguel. Nailed it. Now say, ""I give you my blessing."" I give you my blessing. I give you my blessing to go home... to put my photo back on the ofrenda, and to never play music again. What? She can't do that! Well, technically, she can add any condition she wants. Fine. Then you hand the petal to Miguel. No skeletons! Mariachi Plaza, here I come. Two seconds and you already break your promise. This isn't fair. It's my life. You already had yours. Papa Julio, I ask for your blessing. Tia Rosita? Oscar? Felipe? Tia Victoria? Don't make this hard, mijo. You go home my way or no way. You really hate music that much? I will not let you go down the same path he did. The same path he did. He's family. Listen to your Mama Imelda. She's just looking out for you. Be reasonable. Con permiso, I need to visit the restroom. Be right back. Uh, should we tell him there are no restrooms in the Land of the Dead? Vamonos. We got a family looking for a living boy. If I want to be a musician, I need a musician's blessing. We got to find my great-great-grandpa. Hold it, muchacho. I found that living boy! Oh, whoa, excuse me. Excuse me, folks. Excuse me. Oh. No, no. Dante! Disturbing the peace. Fleeing an officer. Falsifying a unibrow. - That's illegal? - Very illegal. You need to clean up your act, amigo. Amigo? Oh, that's so nice to hear you say that because I have just had a... really hard Dia de Muertos and I could really use an amigo right now. And amigos, they help their amigos. You get me across that bridge tonight, and I'll make it worth your while. Oh! You like de la Cruz? He and I go way back. I can get you front row seats to his Sunrise Spectacular show. I'll get you backstage. You can meet him. You just got to let me cross that bridge! I should lock you up for the rest of the holiday. But my shift's almost up and I want to visit my living family. So I'm letting you off with a warning. Can I at least get my costume back? Uh... No. Some amigo. Hey! Hey! You really know de la Cruz? Who wants to... Ahh! Ay! You're alive! Shh! Yeah, I'm alive. And if I want to get back to the Land of the Living... I need de la Cruz's blessing. That's weirdly specific. He's my great-great-grandfather. He's your Gr... What? Ugh. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait. No, wait, wait, wait. Wait! Yes! You're going back to the Land of the Living! You know what? Maybe this isn't such a good... No, no, nino! Nino, nino, I can help you. You can help me. We can help each other. But most importantly, you can help me. - Miguel! - I'm Hector. That's nice. Esperame, chamaco! Ay, he is going to get himself killed. I need my spirit guide... Pepita. Who has that petal Miguel touched? Here. Nice alebrije. Ay, ay, hold still. Look up. A ver, a ver. Look up, up, up. Aqui arriba, eso... Eh, la rayita. Okay. Hey! Ta-da! Dead as a doorknob. So listen, Miguel, this place runs on memories. When you're well remembered, people put up your photo and you get to... cross the bridge and visit the living on Dia de Muertos. Unless you're me. You don't get to cross over? No one's ever put up my picture. But you can change that! This is you? Eh, muy guapo, eh? So, you get me to my great-great-grandpa... then I put up your photo when I get home? Such a smart boy! Yes! Great idea, yes! One hiccup. De la Cruz is a tough guy to get to and I need to cross the bridge soon. Like, tonight. So, you got any other family here, you know? Someone a bit more, eh, accessible? Mmm... Nope. Don't yank my chain, chamaco. You got to have some other family. Only de la Cruz. If you can't help me, I'll find him myself. Oh! Okay. Okay, kid. Fine! Fine! I'll get you to your great-great-grandpa. It's not gonna be easy, you know? He's a busy man. What are you doing? I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in. No. Skeletons don't walk like that. - It's how you walk. - No, I don't! Stop it! Whoa! Ernesto de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular? Que padre! Every year your great-great-grandpa puts on that dumb show... to mark the end of Dia de Muertos. - And you can get us in! - Um... Hey, you said you have front row tickets! That... was a lie. I apologize for that. Cool off, chamaco. Come on. I'll get you to him. How? Because I happen to know where he's rehearsing.  Remember me Don't let it make you cry  You better have my dress, Hector. Hola, Ceci. - Hola. - Ceci, I lost the dress. Ya lo sabia! I got to dress forty dancers by sunrise. Thanks to you, I'm one Frida short of an opening number! Dante! We shouldn't be in here. No, no, Dante! Ven aca! You! How did you get in here? - I just followed my... - Oh! The mighty Xolo dog! Guider of wandering spirits. And whose spirit have you guided to me? I don't think he's a spirit guide. Ah, ah, ah. The alebrijes of this world can take many forms. They are as mysterious as they are powerful. Or maybe he's just a dog. Come, I need your eyes. You are the audience. Darkness. And from the darkness, a giant papaya. Dancers emerge from the papaya, and the dancers are all me. And they go to drink from the milk of their mother, who is a cactus. But who is also me. And her milk is not milk but tears. Is it too obvious? I think it's just the right amount of obvious? It could use some music. Oh, what if you did like... Oh! And then it could go... And what if everything was on fire? Yes! Fire! Everywhere! Inspired! You have the spirit of an artist. The dancers exit. The music fades, the lights go out. And Ernesto de la Cruz rises to the stage! Huh? He does a couple of songs, the sun rises, everyone cheers... Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz? Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals! He's too busy hosting that fancy party at the top of his tower. Chamaco, you can't run off on me like that. Stop pestering the celebrities. You said my great-great-grandpa would be here! He's halfway across town throwing some big party. That bum. Who doesn't show up to his own rehearsal? If you're such good friends, how come he didn't invite you? He's your great-great-grandpa, how come he didn't invite you? Hey, Gustavo! You know anything about this party? It's the hot ticket! But if you're not on the guest list, you're never getting in, Chorizo. Hey! It's Chorizo! Choricito! A-ha. Very funny, guys. Very funny. Chorizo? Oh, this guy's famous! Go on, go on. Ask him how he died. I don't want to talk about it. He choked on some chorizo! I didn't choke, okay? I got food poisoning which is a big difference. This is why I don't like musicians. Bunch of self-important jerks. - Hey! I'm a musician! - You are? If you really want to get to Ernesto, there is that music competition... at the Plaza de la Cruz. Winner gets to play at his party. No, no. Chamaco, you're loco if you think... I need to get my great-great-grandfather's blessing! You know where I can get a guitar? I know a guy. Have you found him, Pepita? Have you found our boy? - A footprint! - It's a Rivera boot. - Size seven! - And a half. - Pronated. - Miguel. Why the heck would you want to be a musician? My great-great-grandpa was a musician! Who spent his life performing like a monkey for complete strangers. No thank you. No! Guacala! What do you know? So, how far is this guitar anyway? We're almost there. Keep up, chamaco. Come on. - Cousin Hector! - Hey! These guys! Hey, Tio! Que onda? These people are all your family? Uh... In a way. We're all the ones with no photos or ofrendas. No family to go home to. Nearly forgotten, you know? So, we all call each other cousin, or tio, or whatever. - Hector! - Tia Chelo! Muchas gracias! Hey! Save some for me! Is Chicharron around? Eh, in the bungalow. I don't know if he's in the mood for visitors. Who doesn't like a visit from Cousin Hector? Buenas noches, Chicharron! I don't want to see your stupid face, Hector. Come on. It's Dia de Muertos. I brought you a little offering. - Get out of here. - I would, Cheech. But the thing is, me and my friend, Miguel... We really need to borrow your guitar. - My guitar? - Yes. My prized beloved guitar? I promise we'll bring it right back. Like the time you promised to bring back my van? - Uh... - Or my mini-fridge? - Ah, you see... - Or my good napkins? My lasso? My femur? Well, no, not like those times. Where is my femur? You... Whoa, whoa. - You okay, amigo? - I'm fading, Hector. I can feel it. I couldn't even play that thing if I wanted to. You play me something. No. You know I don't play anymore, Cheech. The guitar is for the kid. You want it, you got to earn it. Ay, only for you, amigo. Any requests? You know my favorite, Hector.  Well, everyone knows Juanita  Her eyes each a different color  Her teeth stick out And her chin goes in  And her...  Knuckles they drag on the floor - Those aren't the words. - There are children present.  Her hair is like a briar  She stands in a bow-legged stance  And if I weren't so ugly  She'd possibly give me a chance  Brings back memories. Gracias. Wait. What happened? He's been forgotten. When there's no one left in the living world who remembers you... you disappear from this world. We call it the final death. Where did he go? No one knows. But I've met him. I could remember him when I go back! No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco. Our memories, they have to be passed down by those who knew us in life... in the stories they tell about us. But there's no one left alive to pass down Cheech's stories. Hey, it happens to everyone eventually. Come on, de la Cruzcito, you've got a contest to win. You told me you hated musicians. You never said you were one. How do you think I knew your great-great-grandpa? We used to play music together. Taught him everything he knows. No manches! You played with Ernesto de la Cruz... the greatest musician of all time? Ah, you're funny. Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe. But his music? Eh, not so much. You don't know what you're talking about. Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz! Showtime, chamaco! Llevelo! T-shirts! Bobbleheads! Bienvenidos a todos! Oh! Who's ready for some musica? It's a battle of the bands, amigos. The winner gets to play for the maestro himself, Ernesto de la Cruz... at his fiesta tonight! That's our ticket, muchacho. Oh! Oh, oh, oh! Let the competition begin! So, what's the plan? What are you gonna play? Definitely Remember Me. No! Not that one. No. Come on. It's his most popular song! Ah, it's too popular.  Remember me Though I have to travel far   Remember me...   Don't let it make you cry...  - What about Poco Loco? - Epa! Now that's a song! De la Cruzcito? You're on standby. Los Chachalacos, you're up next. Los Chachalacos! You always this nervous before a performance? I don't know. I've never performed before. What? You said you were a musician! I am! I mean, I will be. - Ay! - Once I win. That's your plan? No. You have to win. Your life literally depends on... you winning. And you've never done this before! I'll go up there. - No! I need to do this. - Why? If I can't go out and play one song, how can I call myself a musician? What does that matter? Because I don't just want to get de la Cruz's blessing... I need to prove that I'm worthy of it. Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment at such a bad time! Okay! Okay. You want to perform? Then you got to perform! First, you have to loosen up. Shake off those nerves. Now give me your best grito. - My best grito? - Come on, yell! Belt it out. Ah, it feels good. Okay, now you. Oh, come on, kid. De la Cruzcito, you're on now! Miguel, look at me. Hey, look at me. You can do this. Grab their attention and don't let it go. Make them listen, chamaco. You've got this. De la Cruzcito What's he doing? Why isn't he playing? Bring back the singing dogs! Que bien! Vamonos! Whoo!  What color is the sky? Ay mi amor, ay mi amor  You tell me that it's red Ay mi amor, ay mi amor  Where should I put my shoes? Ay mi amor, ay mi amor  You say put them on your head  Ay mi amor, ay mi amor  You make me un poco loco Un poqui-ti-ti-to loco  The way you keep me guessing I'm nodding and I'm yes-ing  I'll count it as a blessing  That I'm only un poco loco No! No! No! Not bad for a dead guy! Not so bad yourself, gordito! Eso! He's close! Find him!  The loco that you make me It is just un poco crazy  The sense that you're not making  The liberties you're taking  Leaves my cabeza shaking You're just un poco loco We're looking for a living kid. About twelve? Have you seen a living boy?  Un poqui-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti- ti-ti-ti-to loco  Hey! You did good! I'm proud of you. Eso! Otra! Otra! Otra! - Hey! Where are you going? - We got to get out of here! What? Are you crazy? We're about to win this thing. Damas y caballeros, I have an emergency announcement. Please be on the lookout for a living boy. Answers to the name of Miguel. Earlier tonight he ran away from his family. They just want to send him back to the Land of the Living. Wait, wait. You said de la Cruz was your only family. The only person who could send you home. I do have other family, but... You could have taken my photo back this whole time? But they hate music! I need a musician's blessing. - You lied to me! - Oh, you're one to talk. Look at me. I'm being forgotten, Miguel. I don't even know if I'm gonna last the night. I'm not gonna miss my one chance to cross that bridge because... you want to live out some stupid musical fantasy. It's not stupid! I'm taking you to your family. - Let go of me! - You'll thank me later. You don't want to help me. You only care about yourself! Keep your dumb photo. Stay away from me! No! Hey, chamaco! Where did you go? Chamaco! I'm sorry! Come back! Dante, callate! No! Dante, stop it. He can't help me. Dante! Stop! Stop it! Leave me alone! You're not a spirit guide. You're just a dumb dog! Now get out of here! - It's him! - It's that living boy! - I heard about him. Look! - He's alive! - He's alive. - The boy is alive! This nonsense ends now, Miguel! I am giving you my blessing and you are going home. I don't want your blessing! Miguel, stop! Come back! Miguel! I am trying to save your life! - You're ruining my life! - What? Music's the only thing that makes me happy. And you want to take it away. You'll never understand.  Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona  No dejare de quererte...  I thought you hated music. Oh, I loved it! I remember that feeling... when my husband would play, and I would sing and nothing else mattered. But when we had Coco, suddenly there was something in my life that... mattered more than music. I wanted to put down roots. He wanted to play for the world. We each made a sacrifice to get what we wanted. Now you must make a choice. But I don't want to pick sides! Why can't you be on my side? That's what family's supposed to do. Support you. But you never will. - Have a good time. - Oh, how exciting! Oh, El Santo. I'm a big fan! You mind if I... Gracias, Senor. - Invitation? - It's okay. I'm Ernesto's great-great-grandson. - Disculpen, senores... - Hey, guys! It's poco loco! - You were on fire tonight! - You too! Hey, musician to musician... I need a favor. Oh, the competition winners. Congratulations, chicos. Thanks, guys! Whoa! Hey! Enjoy the party, little musico! Gracias! Oh! Oh! Look! It's Ernesto! De la Cruz! Senor de la Cruz! Pardon me! Senor de la Cruz! Senor de la... When you see your moment, you mustn't let it pass you by. You must seize it. This one has a wise spirit.   We're almost there, Dante. Senor de la Cruz! Senor de la... But what can we do? It is hopeless... You must have faith, sister. But Padre, he will never listen. He will listen... to music.  Senoras y senores, buenas tardes, buenas noches  Buenas tardes, buenas noches Senoritas y senores  To be here with you tonight Brings me joy! Que alegria  For this music is my language  And the world es mi familia  For this music is my language  And the world es mi familia  For this music is my language  And the world es mi familia  For this music is my lang...  Are you all right, nino? It's you! You are that boy! The one who came from the Land of the Living. You... know about me? You are all anyone has been talking about. Why have you come here? I'm Miguel. Your great-great-grandson. I... have a great-great-grandson? I need your blessing so I can go back home and be a musician. Just like you. The rest of our family, they wouldn't listen. But I hoped you would. My boy, with a talent like yours, how could I not listen? Aww! I have a great-great-grandson! - Look! It's Frida! - Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo. - It is an honor, Senora. - Gracias. Hey, Negrete! Infante! Have you met my great-great-grandson? My great-great-grandson. He's alive! And a musician to boot! Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple. No dimple! To our friendship. I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo. Salud! Poison! You know, I did all my own stunts.  Though I have to say goodbye Remember me...  All of this came from my amazing fans in the Land of the Living. They leave me more offerings than I know what to do with! Hey, what's wrong? Is it too much? You look overwhelmed. - No! It's all great! - But? It's just... I have been looking up to you my whole life. You're the guy who actually did it! But did you ever regret it? Choosing music over everything else? It was hard. Saying goodbye to my hometown. Heading off on my own... Leaving your family? Si. But I could not have done it differently. One cannot deny who one is meant to be. And you, my great-great-grandson, are meant to be a musician! You and I, we are artists, Miguel. We cannot belong to one family. The world is our family. Ooh! Ooh! The fireworks have begun! Soon the party will move across town for my Sunrise Spectacular. Miguel, you must come to the show! You will be my guest of honor! - You mean it? - Of course, my boy. I can't. I have to get home before sunrise. Oh! I really do need to get you home. It has been an honor. I am sorry to see you go, Miguel. I hope you die very soon. You know what I mean. Miguel, I give you my bless... We had a deal, chamaco. Who are you? What is the meaning of this? Oh, Frida! I thought you couldn't make it. You said you'd take back my photo. You promised, Miguel. You know this, uh, man? Uh, I just met him tonight. He told me he knew you. Hector? Please, Miguel. Put my photo up. My friend, you're being forgotten. - And whose fault is that? - Hector, please... Those were my songs you took. My songs that made you famous. What? If I'm being forgotten, it's because you never told anyone that I wrote them! That's crazy! De la Cruz wrote all his own songs. You want to tell him or should I? Hector, I never meant to take credit. We made a great team, but you died... and I only sang your songs because I wanted to keep a part of you alive. Oh, how generous! You really did play together. I don't want to fight about it. I just want you to make it right. Miguel can put my photo up, and I can cross over the bridge. I can see my girl. Ernesto, remember the night I left? That was a long time ago. We drank together and you told me you would move Heaven and Earth... for your amigo. Well, I'm asking you to now. Heaven and Earth? Like in the movie? - What? - That's Don Hidalgo's toast. In the de la Cruz movie, El Camino a Casa. I'm talking about my real life, Miguel. No! It's in there. Look! Never were truer words spoken. This calls for a toast. To our friendship! I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo. But in the movie, Don Hidalgo poisons the drink. - Salud! - Poison! That night, Ernesto. The night I left... We'd been performing on the road for months. I got homesick... and I packed up my songs. You want to give up now when we're this close to reaching our dream? This was your dream. You'll manage. I can't do this without your songs, Hector. I'm going home, Ernesto. Hate me if you want, but my mind is made up. Oh, I could never hate you. If you must go, then I'm sending you off with a toast. To our friendship. I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo. Salud! You walked me to the train station. But I felt a pain in my stomach. I thought it must have been something I ate. Perhaps it was that chorizo, my friend. Or something I drank. I woke up dead. You poisoned me. You're confusing movies with reality, Hector. All this time, I thought it was just bad luck. I never thought that you might have... That you... - How could you? - Hector! Security! Security! You took everything away from me! You rat! Have him taken care of. He's not well. I just wanted to go back home. No! No! I apologize. Where were we? You were going to give me your blessing. Yes. Uh, si. Miguel, uh, my reputation... It is very important to me. I would hate to have you think... That you murdered Hector for his songs? You don't think that. Do you? I... No. Everyone knows you're the good guy. Papa Ernesto, my blessing? Security? Take care of Miguel. He'll be extending his stay. What? But I'm your family! And Hector was my best friend. Success doesn't come for free, Miguel. You have to be willing to do whatever it takes to seize your moment. I know you understand. No! No! Let go! No! Help! Can anyone hear me? I want to go home. - Hector? - Kid? Oh, Hector! You were right. I should have gone back to my family. They told me not to be like de la Cruz, but I didn't listen. I told them I didn't care if they remembered me. I didn't care if I was on their stupid ofrenda. Hey, chamaco. It's okay. It's okay. I told them I didn't care. Hector! Hector? She's forgetting me. - Who? - My daughter. She's the reason you wanted to cross the bridge. I just wanted to see her again. I never should have left Santa Cecilia. I wish I could apologize. I wish I could tell her that her papa was trying to come home. That he loved her so much. My Coco... Coco? Where did you get this? That's my Mama Coco. That's my Mama Imelda. Is that you? - We're... - Family? I always hoped I'd see her again. That she'd miss me. Maybe put up my photo. But it never happened. You know the worst part? Even if I never got to see Coco in the living world... I thought at least one day I'd see her here. Give her the biggest hug. But she's the last person who remembers me. The moment she's gone from the living world... You disappear... from this one. You'll never get to see her. Ever again. You know, I wrote her a song once. We used to sing it every night at the same time. No matter how far apart we were. What I wouldn't give to sing it to her one... last... time.  Remember me  Though I have to say goodbye Remember me  Don't let it make you cry  For even if I'm far away I hold you in my heart  I sing a secret song to you Each night we are apart  Remember me Papa!  Though I have to travel far Remember me  Each time you hear a sad guitar  Know that I'm with you The only way that I can be  Until you're in my arms again  Remember me  He stole your guitar. He stole your songs. You should be the one the world remembers, not de la Cruz! I didn't write Remember Me for the world. I wrote it for Coco. I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a great-great-grandpa. Are you kidding? A minute ago I thought I was related to a murderer. You're a total upgrade. My whole life, there's been something... that made me different. And I never knew where it came from. But now I know. It comes from you. I'm proud we're family! I'm proud to be his family! I'm proud to be his family! Dante? Dante! It's Dante! - Imelda! - Hector. You look good. Dante! You knew he was my Papa Hector the whole time! You are a real spirit guide. Who's the good spirit guide? You are! Whoa! Dante! There they are! Miguel! Miguelito! Look, it's Miguel! He's all right. Gracias, Dios mio. Que bueno. Mijo, I was so worried! Thank goodness we found you in time. And you... How many times must I turn you away? Imelda. I want nothing to do with you! Not in life, not in death! I spent decades protecting my family from your mistakes. He spends five minutes with you and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole! I wasn't in there because of Hector. He was in there because of me. He was just trying to get me home! I didn't want to listen, but he was right. Nothing's more important than family. I'm ready to accept your blessing. And your conditions. But first, I need to find de la Cruz. To get Hector's photo. - What? - So he can see Coco again. Hector should be on our ofrenda. He's part of our family. He left this family! He tried to go home to you and Coco. But de la Cruz murdered him! It's true, Imelda. And so what if it's true? You leave me alone with a child to raise... and I'm just supposed to forgive you? Imelda, I... Hector! I'm running out of time. It's Coco. She's forgetting you. You don't have to forgive him. But we shouldn't forget him. I wanted to forget you. I wanted Coco to forget you too, but... This is my fault. Not yours. I'm sorry, Imelda. Miguel, if we help you get his photo, you will return home? No more music? Family comes first. I can't forgive you. But I will help you. So, how do we get to de la Cruz? I might know a way. - Good luck, muchacho. - Gracias, Frida. - Here, let me help you with... - Don't touch me! - Everyone clear on the plan? - Find Hector's photo. - Give it to Miguel. - Send Miguel home. Got your petals? Now, we just have to find de la Cruz. Yes? Don't I know you? That's for murdering the love of my life! - Who... Who the... - She's talking about me! I'm the love of your life? I don't know. I'm still angry at you. Hector! How did you... And that's for trying to murder my grandson. - Grandson? - She's talking about me! You! Wait. You're related to Hector? The photo! Uh... After him! Security! Ayudenme! - You said love of your life. - I don't know what I said. That's what I heard. Places, Senor. You're on in thirty seconds. Ay! Miguel! I have it! Oh! Hurry! Come on! Ladies and gentlemen... the one... the only... Ernesto de la Cruz! Get her off the stage. Sing! Sing!  Ay, de mi Llorona  Llorona de azul celeste  Ay, de mi Llorona  Llorona de azul celeste  Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona  No dejare de quererte  No dejare de quererte  Me subi al pino mas alto, Llorona  A ver si te divisaba  Como el pino era tierno, Llorona  Al verme llorar, lloraba  Ay de mi Llorona, Llorona Llorona de azul celeste  Ay de mi Llorona, Llorona Llorona de azul celeste  Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona  No dejare de quererte Let go of me!  Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona  No dejare de quererte  No dejare de quererte  No dejare de quererte  Ay, ay, ay  I forgot what that felt like. You still got it. Oh. Miguel, I give you my blessing. To go home, to put up our photos and to never... Never play music again. To never forget how much your family loves you. You're going home. You're not going anywhere. Imelda! Stay back! Stay back! All of you, stay back. Not one more step. Dante! Ernesto, stop! Leave the boy alone. I've worked too hard, Hector. Too hard to let him destroy everything. He's a living child, Ernesto. He's a threat! You think I'd let him go back to the Land of the Living with your photo? To keep your memory alive? No. - You're a coward! - I am Ernesto de la Cruz. The greatest musician of all time! Hector's the real musician. You're just the guy who murdered him and stole his songs! Murdered? I am the one who's willing to do what it takes to seize my moment. Whatever it takes. No! Miguel! Apologies, old friend. But the show must go on. Please, please, mi familia. Murderer! Orchestra. A-one, a-two, a-one...  Remember me Though I have to s...  Hey! Look! Nice kitty. Put me down! No, please! I beg of you! Stop! Stop! No! No! No! What did I miss? Good boy, Dante! Miguel! Hector! The photo... I lost it! It's okay, mijo. It's o... Hector! Hector? Coco. No! We can still find the photo. Miguel, it's almost sunrise. No, no. I can't leave you. I promised I'd put your photo up. I promised you'd see Coco. We're both out of time, mijo. Oh no! No! She can't forget you! I just wanted her to know that I loved her. Hector! You have our blessing, Miguel. No conditions. No! Papa Hector, please! No! Go home. I promise I won't let Coco forget you! There he is! Miguel! Stop! Where have you been? I need to see Mama Coco, please. What are you doing with that... Give it to me! Miguel, stop! Miguel! Miguel! Mama Coco? Can you hear me? It's Miguel. I saw your papa. Remember? Papa? Please! If you forget him, he'll be gone. Forever. Miguel, open this door! Here. This was his guitar, right? He used to play it to you? See? There he is! Papa! Remember? Papa? Miguel! Mama Coco, please! Don't forget him. What are you doing to that poor woman? It's okay, Mamita. It's okay. What's gotten into you? I thought I'd lost you, Miguel. I'm sorry, Papa. We're all together now. That's what matters. Not all of us. It's okay, Mamita. Miguel, you apologize to your Mama Coco. Mama Coco? Well? Apologize! Mama Coco? Your papa, he wanted you to have this. Mama, wait!  Remember me  Though I have to say goodbye  Remember me  Don't let it make you cry  For even if I'm far away  I hold you in my heart I sing a secret song to you  Each night we are apart  Remember me  Though I have to travel far  Remember me  Each time you hear a sad guitar  Know that I'm with you The only way that I can be  Until you're in my arms again  Remember me  Elena? What's wrong, mija? Nothing, Mama. Nothing at all. My papa used to sing me that song. He loved you, Mama Coco. Your papa loved you so much. I kept his letters. Poems he wrote me. And... Papa was a musician. When I was a little girl... he and Mama would sing such beautiful songs. And right over here, one of Santa Cecilia's greatest treasures. The home of the esteemed song writer, Hector Rivera. The letters Hector wrote home for his daughter, Coco, contain the lyrics... for all of your favorite songs. Not just Remember Me. And that man is your Papa Julio. And there's Tia Rosita and your Tia Victoria. And those two are Oscar and Felipe. These aren't just old pictures, they're our family... and they're counting on us to remember them.  Say that I'm crazy or call me a fool Enjoy your visit, Hector.  But last night it seemed that I dreamed about you - Papa! - Coco!  When I opened my mouth what came out was a song  And you know every word and we all sang along  To a melody played on the strings of our souls  And a rhythm that rattled us down to the bone  Our love for each other will live on forever  In every beat of my proud corazon  Our love for each other will live on forever  In every beat of my proud corazon  Ay mi familia Oiga mi gente  Canten a coro Let it be known  Our love for each other will live on forever  In every beat of my proud corazon  Ay mi familia Oiga mi gente  Canten a coro Let it be known  Our love for each other will live on forever  In every beat of my proud corazon   explosiveskull  GoldenBeard  Remember me  Though I have to say goodbye Remember me  Don't let it make you cry  For even if I'm far away I hold you in my heart  I sing a secret song to you Each night we are apart  Remember me  Though I have to travel far Remember me  Each time you hear a sad guitar  Know that I'm with you The only way that I can be  Until you're in my arms again  Remember me  If you close your eyes and let the music play  Keep our love alive I'll never fade away  If you close your eyes and let the music play  Keep our love alive I'll never fade away  If you close your eyes and let the music play  Keep our love alive I'll never fade away  Remember me  For I will soon be gone Remember me  And let the love we have live on  And know that I'm with you the only way that I can be  So, until you're on my arms again  Remember me  Remember me  Remember me "
3,2013,Black Rock,American,"Sarah (Kate Bosworth) invites her childhood friends, Abby (Katie Aselton) and Lou (Lake Bell), to a remote island that they once spent time at in their youth, in hopes of bringing their distant group back together. Though Abby and Lou are reluctant, they go with Sarah to the island. While there, they use a hand drawn map to try to find a time capsule they had buried as kids. They give up after Abby picks a fight with Lou over Lou having slept with her boyfriend years ago, something Abby has never gotten over and which ruined their friendship.
On their first night while camping on the beach, they run into Henry (Will Bouvier), Derek (Jay Paulson) and Alex (Anslem Richardson), three veteran soldiers who are hunting on the island. Lou recognizes Henry as the younger brother of a former classmate and Abby invites the three to camp with them. While drunk, Abby flirts with Henry and eventually takes him into the woods to make out. When she tries to stop, Henry becomes aggressive and tries to rape her. Abby hits him in the head with a large rock.
Hearing Abby's screams, the rest of the group come running and find Henry dead. Abby tries to explain what happened but the men don't believe her and become enraged that she's murdered their best friend. Derek and Alex knock the three women unconscious. When they wake, they are tied together by the wrists on the beach. Derek, the more aggressive of the two men, is adamant about killing them, but Alex tries to stop him. Abby goads Derek into letting her go so they can fight hand-to-hand. When he does, Lou tackles him as Sarah throws sand at Alex's face to prevent him from attacking. The three women then separately escape and hide, and the two men vow to kill them.
After hiding separately, they meet up at a childhood fort and decide to wait until nightfall before trying to reach their boat. Upon doing so, they discover the two men have cut the rope that tied the boat to the shore, sending it floating out to sea. Abby and Lou both believe they could swim it but Sarah believes it's too far and that they'd die from hypothermia before reaching it. As they crawl towards the shore, Sarah loudly protests the plan and runs back towards the tree line where she is shot in the head, by the men. Lou and Abby try to swim for the boat but cannot make it, instead heading back to another part of shore. Alex falls down a hill while chasing them and breaks his leg. Lou and Abby return to the fort and huddle together for warmth. They vow to ""stop being stalked and start stalking.""
In the morning, they find the time capsule and retrieve a Swiss army knife from inside. They sharpen sticks into weapons. As they do, they talk about the past and reconcile. They search the island and find the hunters camping on the beach, with an injured Alex sleeping nearby. Abby crawls over to Alex, prepared to slit his throat. However, she accidentally wakes him and he cries out for Derek. Lou runs at Derek, distracting him and Abby wrestles with Alex, eventually shooting him with his own shotgun. Derek chases Lou and Abby finally cornering them in an open field. He fires his gun, but realizes he has run out of bullets. He draws his hunting knife and the two women attack him from opposite directions. They fight, with a wounded Lou eventually slitting Derek's throat with his knife. Lou and Abby take the men's boat and sail back to civilization.",4.8,tt1930294,"Oh, my God. You, like, threw up back here with your preparation. I swear to God. That's like a Sarah tornado.

So you guys have a really great weekend, though. It was great to see you both, honestly. I'm sorry. I'm with Abby on this one. Seriously, like, I hear where you're coming from and you're sweet, but it's, like, it's not a good call, man. It's like... Great. Let's just... We'll do it another time. I have cancer. What? I didn't wanna say anything. I didn't wanna ruin the trip. I didn't want it to be about that. I wanted it to be about us. - They say four to six months. - What?! They say four to six months, but seriously, I've come to terms with it. It's okay. It's okay. The thing that I want most, more than anything in the world, is to have this final hurrah, just the three of us together. Can we do that? - Yeah, yeah. - Can we do that? - Of course. - Yes, yeah. Can we do that? Yes, we can? - Yes, yes. - Seriously, can we do that? 'Cause I'm just riddled with it, you know? Just... it's everywhere. What?

That was bad. That was a bad, bad thing to say and do. That was a horrible thing to say! That was a horrible thing to do, but here's the thing: We are all dying. That's the truth. We have no idea what's gonna happen. We don't know. We could be hit by a bus tomorrow, you know? - We could... we have no idea what's gonna happen. - Oh, my God. And I'll tell you one thing for certain... there are no buses on that island. - Okay. - You know, so we can go out there and be safe from buses, - which is great. - I still, like... I can't... - shit is great. - You're such a... - i want us back. - This is so bad. - Say yes. - Oh, God. - You were looking at me like, ""yeah, you're so in."" - You're an asshole. Say yes, abs.

I mean, look at the view, though. - I know. - It's so beautiful. It smells exactly the same. It smells like childhood to me. Does anyone mind if I, like, check my phone really quick? Is that, like, gonna kill the mood? - No, do it. Do what you gotta do. - 'Kay. Urgent text situation. No, just addicted to my phone. Lol. Omg. I don't even think people say that anymore. Aw. Whatever. I don't care. There's no reception. I'm totally fine with it. What are we gonna do while we're here? Is this it? It's not it, is it? - No? - I have a plan. - Like... like a Sarah plan? - Wow, wait a second. Hold up. - Sarah has a plan? - Of course Sarah has a plan. Okay. Oh, no. Oh, God. Okay. - Okay, guys.

This is our map. - Look it. We are here. - No, I get that we are here, but, like, this isn't gonna take us anywhere. - Yeah, it is. - Do you see what this is showing us? - Yes. No, it's pretty self-explanatory. - No. - This is us. - Oh, obviously. - This is Sheila beal's tits. Remember? - And you take four dashes - to the left and then you're at the fort and the time capsule. - Right. I've checked it out. I mean, the coordinates are right. I mean, generally. - We were 10. - I know, but it's gonna be great. - Abby, dude. Don't poo-poo it. - Seriously, think of it like an adventure, you guys. Lou, dude. I'm good. I'm just questioning the, uh... I hear that, but it's great, Sarah. Sarah, this is great. Let's do it. - Yeah? - Yes. - Yeah? - Hey, I am down. - I am so pumped. - Let's do it, you guys. Let's find it. - Serious. - So... - Let's go. - But I am still so wet. - I think it's northeast and then that means... - No, it's definitely northeast. - She was really beautiful. - Remember her? I can't hear you, Sarah. Sasha. The girl that was really pretty in school. - The exchange student. She's gay. - Yeah. - What? - She's gay now. - I know. - But then I was thinking maybe, like... - I don't know. I'd make out with her. - I know. I was, like, if I had to go gay, like, Sasha Warren would be the girl, right? - Where is she from? - It was like Ukraine or something. Yeah, I mean, I think it's just, like... northeast is straight up into... - just gonna go up into this.. - No, it was Denmark. - Oh, fuck. Denmark. - Yeah. - I just... I just remembered. - I just feel like all Danish are just, like... but the truth is, like, you just... like, I would be fine with, like, smooching, but, like, I don't know if I could, like, - you know, go the whole hog. - There's the tree. Oh, the tree that looks like Abby taking a dump. You guys, it doesn't even look like that at all. It's just, like, it's a tree... it's a stump. No, but it's definitely like a... um... - It's like a bent-over shape. - Silhouette. Guys, I think we should just throw it in. We're not gonna find this fucking fort. - No, I think it's... - It's just... yeah, that's part of the adventure, Abby. - Just go with it. - Well, it was really fun when we were 10, but now I'm just getting eaten alive by mosquitos. - Jesus Christ. - What? - Huh? - Not you. You. You're rolling your eyes at me, what? - Um... - What is your problem? - I don't have a problem, Abby - I'm sensing a serious attitude here. - What is going... what? - You are honestly sensing attitude - from me at this point? - Mm-hmm. I am. - I... - You know, you don't need Sarah's permission to just tell me what's on your mind. Abby, please. Like, let's just... we're out here, you know, it's so fucking beautiful, right? I mean, we haven't been here in so long. Look, Sarah doesn't have cancer. That's good. That's... - Like, let's go have some fun. - I agree. I think we should just keep going. I wanna know what the fuck your problem is, Lou. Oh, my God. Are we really gonna do this? Do what? Abigail, come on. It was fucking ages ago and I apologized. Oh, no, no, no. I wasn't even talking about that. - Oh, really? - Yeah, I'm totally over it. I'm great. You're clearly not over it. Can we just call that out? - You are the one that brought it up. - I brought it up because you are making it very difficult for us to just, like, have a nice time right now. Because of some stupid indiscretion that happened, like, six years ago. - Oh, is that how you see that? - Yes. You really see fucking my boyfriend of two years... the guy who I was pretty sure I was probably gonna marry maybe someday... you thought that was just a small, stupid indiscretion? We were children at that point and we were both fucking drunk and the guy was, honestly, like a class-a douchebag. Like, you should be thanking me that you didn't walk down the aisle with that guy. All right, well, thank you, thank you, thank you! Thank you so much, Lou, for fucking my boyfriend. - I don't mean it like... - I appreciate it with all of... - I feel really badly about it. - You were my best friend and if you're calling him a douchebag, I would love to know what the fuck that makes you. I don't even know why we're talking about it still at this point because you have this amazing life. You're fucking married. You're married. Don't... don't talk like you know anything about my life right now. - You are not a part of my life, Lou. - Why even... - you have not been a part of my life for a really long time. - That is your doing. - And do you wanna know why? - That's your doing. Because you never, ever apologized. - I have apologized to you thousands of times... - You said you were sorry - and you never meant it! Never! - What?! - You would look at me like I was stupid and overreacting - Just can't win. - And taking it too far. - You took a fucking sledgehammer... - yeah, I wanted to take it to your goddamn fucking face! - You fucking threw it... - okay, guys! - You wanna go in... - yes! I would love to fucking smash your face in! - Guys, guys, guys! - No, if there's a time to do it, do it now. - No. - Guys, stop it. - I would love to, Lou. - All right, well, then, bring it. - Please. - Great. - Stop it, guys. This is crazy. - Just take a fucking time-out. - I agree that it's crazy. - Great, I'm the crazy one. - Guys, please, please, please, - just stop. - I'm a crazy fucking bitch. Dude... I know. I mean, this is just, like... - this is just... cannot. - She started it. Can I say that? Let's go, let's go chase Abby 'cause she's got a problem. I feel like all three of us in this tent is not gonna be good. All things considered. I know. I mean, obviously this went a lot different in my head. - You know, we were having fun and... - I know. - I'm sorry. - This is so crazy because when I think about the three of us, like, back in the day... I feel like we were the crazy ones and she was, like, sweet. - She was sweet Abby and now she's crazy Abby. - She has been acting really... I don't know. She's just been off. - What do you mean? - I don't know. She just doesn't wanna talk about it, which, as you know, for Abby, is really weird. Yeah. Jesus. I mean, the truth is, though, what happened was pretty fucked up. - Yeah, I know, Sarah. I know. - Yeah, I know you know. I know you know and I'm not trying to take sides, - but I'm just... Lou, I'm trying to put a certain - Oh, my God. Perspective on it where I'm looking at someone over there who's really, really, really hurt. And I know for you, you were young and whatever and you're... - yeah. - I know and you've moved past it and I can look at it and I can be past it, but it didn't happen to me. Like, I think for her, it was a game changer. Okay, um... Excuse me. So... I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna sit here... And... You can say whatever you wanna say to me. You wanna call me names or... Get up in my face. I'm just gonna sit here. What?! What?! - Whoa, whoa. - What the fuck is that? Fuck! - What is that? - Sarah: What is it, what is it? - Nothing, it's nothing. - Three hunters up there. - Are you guys all right? - Sorry, it was really scary. - Jesus Christ.

Kind of. Mm. - You know, I, um... - What? - I don't feel great... - Wait, wait, wait. And I think maybe I should go down to the beach - and get... - What happened to having fun, Abby? Oh, no. That was so fun. So fun. I feel like... I wanna know what I am, you know? Fuck. - Ow. God, Henry. - Are you all right? - It hurt. - Sorry, I slipped. Henry wouldn't tell you this, but he... I mean, he'd deny it. Just flat out, but he saved both our lives. Hell, he saved the whole squad in helmand province. Wow. What happened? We got, uh... we came up on a bunker that we thought was abandoned and it was just a bad report. Before we knew it, we were just... Getting shot at. - Shit. - Henry Wallace. - Yeah. - You know, like, little Henry Wallace. I... I... usually when you hear about a local hero, you see it in the headlines, and I just had no idea. - I didn't hear anything about that. - Yeah, well. - I would have heard about him. - Our superiors didn't really approve of our tactics. Sometimes you can't go by the book, you know? I mean, you can't follow every single rule. Shit gets outta hand. You gotta do what you gotta do to get the job done. They sent us back home... Dishonorable discharge. No fucking medals. No shit. But I'll tell you what. The fucking government... they may not say it, but, Henry, boy, he's still a fucking hero. Fuck, yeah, he is. I... oh, Henry, stop. Can you get off? Can you just get off me for a second? - Just get off me. - Oh, no. Get off me, Henry. You wanna have some fucking fun, baby? All right, let's have some fucking fun. What do you think about this, huh? You wanna get fucked tonight? Are you ready to get fucked? Do you wanna have some fucking fun? Let's have some fucking fun, you little bitch. Help, you guys! - What the fuck? - Abby. What the hell was that? Guys! - Help me! Help me... - What the fuck? - Abby? - Henry? - What's going on? What happened? - Jesus fucking... roll him. Get him over gentle. - What happened? - Henry, Henry. - What is it? - Henry, what's the matter with you? - Get the fuck away from him. - You fucking... what'd you fucking do?! What'd you do to him?! - Can you hear me, Henry? - What happened, what happened? - Is he hurt? - Henry, it's Derek. - Keep your fucking eyes open, okay? - Listen, listen. Hey, hey. - Keep your eyes open. That's good. That's good. - Hey, man. - Hey, man. We're gonna get you some help. - Don't close them. - Henry, don't fucking close your eyes! - What? Don't do that, don't do that, man. We'll get help for you, man. - Henry, Henry! - Don't fucking die on me, man! - Open your fucking eyes, man. Open your eyes. - Oh, shit. Oh! Oh! Henry? Oh, no. Fuck, fuck. Oh, my God. Oh, no. Oh, no. Derek, man. What are we gonna do, man? Derek? - Get your fucking gun. - Oh, God. - What? - Get your fucking gun. - What? No. - No. - No, no, no, no. - What? - No, no, no. No, wait. - It was an accident. - Wait, wait, wait. - Please, just stop. - Just... - Wait a minute. Wait. Hang on. - Please, stop. - You fucking cunt! You fucking killed him! Fucking run! This bitch! I swear to God! No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait! No, no! Stop it! Stop! Stop it! Can you use your head? Use your fucking head. Sarah, Sarah. - Wake up. - Oh, my God. Shit. Lou, Lou. Part of me wants to do this shit... just fucking haji style, bro. Just saw their fucking heads off. Calm the fuck down, Derek, okay? Let's just think about this. Just for a second. What is there to fucking think about? You think I didn't... you think I didn't want to beat them to a fucking bloody pulp? I did! We both did. Now all I'm saying is let's just think about this, all right? They're just... they're just fucking girls, okay? They're girls. They're somebody's daughter. They're somebody's sister. They're not fucking haji. That bitch killed Henry. - Fuck, man. - He's fucking dead, Alex. What the fuck do you wanna do? Never... We gotta get outta here. Can you get your hands free? No. I'm totally stuck. - Are you? - These fucking... are you ready to die, bitch? Okay, guys. I'm gonna talk to him. - I'm going. - What are you gonna say? I'm just gonna talk to them. I'm gonna look at 'em and I'm gonna talk to 'em. Okay, okay, guys, okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - Derek, listen. - Shut up. Shut up. - What happened to Henry was a terrible, terrible... - Shut up. Fucking mistake, okay? It was an accident. Abby is sorry. She is sorry, but please, understand that what she did was protecting herself. Can you get that? She thought that he was going to rape her. Can you understand that? Can you get that? Here's what I get. Your fucking slut friend lures my buddy up into the woods... flirting with him all night. Smashes his fucking head in with a rock. That's what I understand. - Okay, okay. You're right. - That's what I understand. - You're right. - Okay? Let's go to the police. Let's tell them everything... We'll just... you can fucking tell them whatever you want. Listen to me! Listen! Don't cry. Don't fucking cry. You fucking pussy. What did you say? You gotta tie up three girls to a tree to kill them? I think you're a fucking pussy! - If we're gonna do this, man, let's just fucking do it. - Hold on a second. - Let's just fucking do it, man. - Hold on a second. Wait, wait. Do you think I'm scared of you? Whoa, fuck. She's got some spunk. How 'bout you fucking untie me like a real man? How 'bout you fucking untie me and let me show you?! - I will show you what I can do! - Shut the fuck up! - I will show you! - Shut up! - This is fucking crazy. You fucking kidding me? - Watch this, watch this. - You're fucking kidding me. - Watch this. - You got a move? - Huh? Go! Ah! - Go! Run! - Up the hill! - Get her up the fucking hill! - Go, go! We been hunting shoddy jihad for three fucking years. What the fuck makes you think this comes out good for you? - Derek. - Yeah. - What the fuck you doing? - What? What the fuck is... why'd you do that? Why'd you let 'em go, huh? You said you were gonna kill 'em and now we're gonna have to. - Huh, you fucking moron? - Jesus, don't worry. We'll find 'em. We came out here to hunt. We'll just hunt 'em down. Do you hear that? We're gonna find you! And I'm gonna kill you! It's on. I'm gonna kill all three of you! One by one! With my bare fucking hands if I have to! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, God, you guys. I didn't think I was gonna see you guys again. - We're alive. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Oh, my God. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Are you okay? - Are you? Oh, my God, you guys. I am so scared. I am so sorry. I don't know what happened last night. - I just... - No, no, no. - It went so far and I messed up. - Abby... - I didn't mean to kill him. - This is not your fault. - Abby, it's not your fault. - This is crazy. This is not your fault. No, no, no, no. Okay, you did what you thought you had to do in order to survive, okay? Listen, listen, guys, listen. We are on a small island and we need to get off. We need to figure out what to do. Maybe... We can stay here 'cause they don't know where we are here. The woods are dense and... and maybe they'll go away, you know? No. - No. - They're not going away. Lou, they're not going away. Did you see them? - Yeah. - They're not gonna stop. No. We have to get to our boat. They'll wait for us at the campsite. They know exactly where it is. They have a boat. Let's get their boat. - It's Jimmy's boat. - But where is it, Lou? - We can't just walk around the island. - We're not gonna go traipsing - around the island 'cause they'll find us. - Okay, okay, okay. Okay. We need to think of something. We wait until it's dark. We wait until it's dark and we go to our boat. - Let's do that. - Okay. So we just wait. Did you hear that? There it is. Okay. - They cut the rope. - Damn it. - How far do you think it's out there? - I don't know. It's far, you know? It's far. Tide's going out. If anything, it's probably going further away. - We can swim that. We can swim that. - No. No, we cannot fucking swim that. Are you fucking crazy? It's freezing. We get hypothermia in less than minutes in fucking August. It's not that far. We can do this. We have to. What else are we gonna fucking do? No, guys. We'll fucking die in that water. I'm a good swimmer. I can do this. You guys go back to the fort. You stay safe. You stay covered. I'll get to the boat, get to the mainland, and come back with the cops. There is no sense with the three of us risking our lives out here. We can't do that. We can't. Worst case... They get me and you guys use the distraction... you just head for the boat. Go for the boat. - You just... - No. - Yes. Yes. - No. We are in this together. She's right. It's the three of us now. - Okay. - Thank you for offering that. All right. I'm gonna go first. If I get to the boat before you do, i will row back for your fat asses. Because you're probably going to be drowning behind me. Let's go. Okay, we can do this. Just stay low and quiet. Guys... This doesn't feel right. Guys? - I don't know. - Shh, Sarah. Guys. Guys! - We're not gonna make that out there. It's too fucking far. - It's not far. - We got this, Sarah. - It's too far. - Shh. - We're not gonna make it, Abby! - Shh! - It's too far out there! - It's too far! - We've got this, Sarah! - It's too far!

I can't do it, Abby! - Yes, you can! - Look how far that fucking boat... look! I'm fucking numb. Okay, okay. Can you make that point? - Where? - There. Go! - They're coming! - They're right there! - Lou, swim! - Go down there! - Swim, Lou, swim! Do it! - Get on the beach! - I can't. - You can. Get the fuck down there, Alex! - Go back! Give me your hand! - I hear ya, I hear ya. I'm coming. - Derek! - I'm coming, I'm coming. Where the fuck did they go? Did you see 'em? - Fuck. - My fucking leg, man. - Fuck! - Fucking help me, man! - All right, all right. - Shit, man. - Oh, fuck. - What does it look like?! Don't move it. Don't move. It's bad. It's not that bad, it's not that bad. - All right, all right. - Oh, God darn it. - I'm here with ya. All right, we'll take care of it. - It hurts, man. You'll be fine. Come on. Come on. Get up. - I can't... I can't... - Get up. We have to... we have to get warm, okay? Take all the wet stuff off. Okay? Take it off. - What? - Take the wet clothes off. Oh, I can't. I can't. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. It's too cold. Body... for body heat. Huddle, huddle. - Shh. - Yeah. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I know. - I know. - Sarah... I know. Oh, God. I can't believe this is happening. No. I can't believe this is fucking happening right now. This is actually happening to us. These are soldiers. Trained soldiers, Abby. They're trained to kill people. They have guns. They're... What do we have? What do we... we have nothing. - They're gonna kill us, they're gonna kill us... - Shut up. Okay? If they hear you, they're gonna kill us really fucking fast, so shut up. - Look at me. - I can't. - Abby, I can't. - Lou, Lou. We are getting off this island, okay? You and me. You and me. We are the only two people in the world right now. The whole wide world. You and me. We are not gonna fucking die on this island. Okay? Lou. Lou. You fucking hit me one more time, I'll fucking rip your throat out. Fucking... okay, okay, okay. - Look at me. - Yeah. - There you are. - Hi. - There you are. - Yeah. Okay. - See? - Yeah. We're gonna get off this island. - Okay? - Yeah. We're gonna get off this island. Breathe. Okay. Now we just need to make a plan. Okay, we just need a plan. I've wanted to hit you for so long. Just so you know. Hi. I love you, abs. - Now let's fucking get back to it. - Okay, okay. They're gonna find us here. This is... - I mean, they're looking for us right now. - They're looking for us and they'll find us right here. - Okay... - So... I say we fucking go for it. - Yeah. - We stop being stalked - and we start stalking, okay? - Yup. Okay? And we kill them before they kill us. I will fucking kill them. I will kill them. Okay. We need a weapon. We need something to fight. Okay. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Lou. - Yeah. - Okay? Okay? 'Kay. - Listen... - Which way? Okay, it's gotta be here. It's gotta be. - Yeah. - Right? Dig. Okay. Fuck. This is it, right? Okay. This is it. It's gotta be here. - Oh, God. - I don't know. Fuck. - Hey. That's it. - Yeah. - You got it? - Yeah. Shh. Oh, my God. Okay. Shh. Wait, wait. What is that? Spears. Abby... I feel so ashamed for what I did to you. I'm so angry that I sabotaged that. I can't believe I'm years old and I just... Feel so unhinged, you know? I left Mike. I hadn't even told Sarah yet. And... the stuff with you and me... You know, I know that... I've held onto that for a really long time. I just... I always felt like it was so much... Easier to blame you for... Things not working out... Than it was to just... Admit that maybe I had messed it up. It's easier to put it on you. I'm really sorry. Good. That must be their boat. Down there. I don't see the other one. Neither do I. - Are we gonna do this? - Yup. If we're gonna do it, we've gotta do it right now. - Yup. - I'll fucking do it. - I'll do it. - No, no. I wanna do it. I wanna do it. Oh, God. You cover my back, okay? You keep your fucking eyes out for that other guy, and if he comes, you cover my back. I got your back. Okay. Okay. Okay. Is there... do I... do I hit a vein? - Is there a vein in there that I need... - You're gonna take this and you're gonna puncture his fucking vein here and you're gonna pull it across. Hard. Okay. Okay. Listen to me, Abigail. Look at me. You're gonna fucking do this. I got to. I'm gonna do it. You're gonna fucking slit his throat. I'm gonna fucking slit his throat. - I'm gonna fucking slit his throat. - I got your back. - You cover me. - I got you. - Slit his... - You crazy fucking bitch. You fucking... - ready? - Okay. - Go. - Okay. Derek! Derek, they're here! Bitch! Derek, they're here! - Derek! - I'm coming! - Motherfucker! - Oh, God! No! No, no! No, no, don't. Please. Fuck! Fuck! I got you. Where can you go? Where you gonna go? Stay still. Still. If you don't... you want... you want me to just use one. You don't want this twice. - Then fucking do it! - Okay. - Just fucking do it. - No! No! No! Fuck! Fuck! - Please. - Stop. Please, stop. - Stop? - Yeah. And just all walk away? Maybe we have a nice picnic or something? No! You killed my two best friends! This ends with you two dead. Die, you fucker! Fuck... you! Fuck! Abby! He's down...  You can holler, you can wail   you can swing, you can flail   you can fuck like a broken sail   but I'll never give you up   if I ever give you up  my heart will surely fail   and after all, God can keep my soul   england have my bones  but don't ever give me up, i could never get back up   when the future starts so slow   no longing for the moonlight   no longing for the sun  no longer will I curse the bad I've done   if there's a time when your feelings gone   I wanna feel it  you can holler, you can wail   you can blow what's left of my right mind   you can swing, you can flail   you can blow what's left of my right mind   I don't mind  there's a time for the second best   and there's a time when the feeling's gone   but it's hard to be hard, I guess   when you're shaking like a dog   you can holler, you can wail   you can blow what's left of my right mind   you can swing, you can flail   you can blow what's left of my right mind   you can holler, you can wail   you can blow what's left of my right mind   you can swing, you can flail   you can blow what's left of my right mind   I don't mind  you can blow what's left of my right mind   you can blow what's left of my right mind   you can holler, you can wail   you can blow what's left of my right mind. "
4,2005,Batman Begins,American,"As a child, Bruce Wayne falls down into a dry well and is attacked by a swarm of bats, subsequently developing a phobia of the creatures. While watching an opera with his parents, Thomas and Martha, Bruce becomes frightened by performers masquerading as bats and asks to leave. Outside, mugger Joe Chill murders Bruce's parents in front of him. Orphaned, Bruce is raised by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth.
Fourteen years later, Chill is freed in exchange for testifying against Gotham City mafia boss Carmine Falcone. Bruce intends to murder Chill, but one of Falcone's assassins does so first. Bruce's childhood friend, Assistant District Attorney Rachel Dawes, berates him for attempting to undermine the justice system, saying that his father would be ashamed. Bruce confronts Falcone, who tells him that real power comes from being feared. Bruce decides to travel the world and learn how to confront injustice. While serving a prison sentence for theft in Bhutan, he meets Henri Ducard, who trains him as a member of the League of Shadows, led by Ra's al Ghul. After completing his training and purging his fears, Bruce learns that the League intends to destroy Gotham, believing it to be corrupt, decadent, hypocritical and beyond saving. Bruce rejects the League's cause and burns down their temple during his escape. Ra's is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious Ducard.
Bruce returns to Gotham intent on fighting crime. Inspired by his childhood fear, he takes up the vigilante identity of ""Batman"" and sets up a base in the caves beneath Wayne Manor. He takes an interest in his family's company, Wayne Enterprises, now run by the unscrupulous William Earle. Company archivist Lucius Fox allows Bruce access to prototype defense technologies, including a protective bodysuit and a heavily armored car, the Tumbler. Bruce poses as a shallow playboy to allay suspicion.
Batman intercepts a drug shipment, provides Rachel with evidence against Falcone, and enlists Sergeant James Gordon, one of the few honest cops left in Gotham, to arrest him. In the prison, Falcone meets Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychiatrist whom he has helped smuggle drugs into Gotham, and threatens to reveal his complicity if he does not declare him mentally unfit for trial. Crane puts on a scarecrow mask and sprays Falcone with a fear-inducing hallucinogen that drives him insane (which causes Falcone to constantly mouth the word ""Scarecrow""), and has him transferred to Arkham Asylum. While investigating ""the Scarecrow"", Batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated. He is saved by Alfred and given an antidote developed by Fox. When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, Crane reveals that he has been pouring his fear-inducing drug into Gotham's water supply. He drugs Rachel with it, but Batman saves her and subdues Crane, who claims to work for Ra's al Ghul. Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety, administers the antidote, and gives her a vial of it for Gordon and another for mass production. Ducard reappears at Bruce's birthday party and reveals himself to be the true Ra's al Ghul. Having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gotham's water supply, rendering Crane's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He sets Wayne Manor aflame and leaves Bruce to die, but Alfred rescues him.
Ra's loads the microwave emitter onto Gotham's monorail system, intending to release the drug as the train travels toward the city's central water source. Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and indirectly reveals his identity to her. He pursues Ra's onto the monorail and fights him just as Gordon uses the Tumbler's cannons to destroy a section of the track. Batman refuses to kill Ra's, but also chooses not to save him, gliding from the train and leaving Ra's aboard as it crashes and explodes, killing him.
Bruce gains Rachel's respect but loses her love, as she decides she cannot be with him while he is Batman. Bruce buys a controlling stake in the now publicly traded Wayne Enterprises, fires Earle, and replaces him with Fox. Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant of the Gotham City Police Department, shows Batman the Bat-Signal, and mentions a criminal who leaves Joker playing cards at crime scenes. Batman promises to investigate, and disappears into the night.",8.2,tt0372784,"Rachel, let me see. - Can I see? - Finders keepers. And I found it. In my garden. Finders keepers. Bruce? Bruce? Mom! Mr. Alfred! Did you have dream? Nightmare. Worse than this place? They are going to fight you. - Again? - Until they kill you. Can they kill me before breakfast? You are in hell, little man. And I am the devil. You're not the devil. You're practice. Solitary. - Why? - For protection. - I don't need protection. - Protection for them. Get in. Are you so desperate to fight criminals... ...that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time? Actually, there were seven of them. I counted six, Mr. Wayne. How do you know my name? The world is too small for someone like Bruce Wayne to disappear... ...no matter how deep he chooses to sink. Who are you? My name is merely Ducard, but I speak for Ra's al Ghul... ...a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld. A man who can offer you a path. What makes you think I need a path? Someone like you is only here by choice. You have been exploring the criminal fraternity... ...but whatever your original intentions... ...you have become truly lost. And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer? The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil... ...and wishes to serve true justice. The path of the League of Shadows. - You're vigilantes. - No, no, no. A vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man... ...if you devote yourself to an ideal... ...and if they can't stop you... ...then you become something else entirely. Which is? Legend, Mr. Wayne. Tomorrow, you will be released. If you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something... ...there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes. Pick one of these flowers. If you can carry it to the top of the mountain... ...you may find what you were looking for in the first place. And what was I looking for? Only you can know that. You turn back. You go back. Ra's al Ghul? Wait. What are you seeking? I seek... ...the means to fight injustice. To turn fear... ...against those who prey on the fearful. To manipulate the fears in others... ...you must first master your own. Are you ready to begin? I can... I can barely stand. Death does not wait for you to be ready! Death is not considerate or fair! And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You're skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us, Mr. Wayne... ...what do you fear? Bruce? It's okay. It's okay. You'll be okay. Will we be needing an ambulance, Master Wayne? No, I'll set the bone and take him for an x-ray later. Very good, sir. - I'm very sorry, sir. I've told... - Don't worry. It's fine. Took quite a fall, didn't we, Master Bruce? And why do we fall, Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves up. Just a little fall. It's just a small fracture. The bats again? You know why they attacked you, don't you? - They were afraid of you. - Afraid of me? All creatures feel fear. Even the scary ones? Especially the scary ones. I got something to show you. - You think your mother will like them? - Yeah. - I think it's time to get up. - Maybe. No going back to bed. Did you build this train, Dad? Gotham's been good to our family, but the city's been suffering. People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times. So we built a new, cheap, public transportation system to unite the city. And at the center... ...Wayne Tower. - Is that where you work? - No, I work at the hospital. I leave the running of our company to much better men. - Better? - Well... ...more interested men. Can we go? Please. Okay. Let's go. - What's wrong, Bruce? - No, no. It was me. I just needed some fresh air. A little bit of opera goes a long way. Right, Bruce? Come on. Let's go. Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast. - That's fine. - Fast. Take it easy. Take it easy. Here you go. It's fine. It's fine. Now just take it and go. - I said, jewelry. - Hey... Thomas! Bruce. It's okay. Don't be afraid. Is this your father's? It's okay. Come here. There you go. It's okay. It's okay. Gordon. Hey. Good news. We got him, son. You're in excellent hands. We'll be watching the empire. When you grow up, it'll be waiting for you. I thought I might prepare a little supper. - Very well. - Alfred? - Yes, Master Bruce? - It was my fault, Alfred. - I made them leave the theater. - No. - If I hadn't gotten scared... - It was nothing that you did. It was him, and him alone. Do you understand? I miss them, Alfred. I miss them so much. So do I, Master Bruce. So do I. And do you still feel responsible for your parents' death? My anger outweighs my guilt. Come. You have learned to bury your guilt with anger. I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth. You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600. You know how to disappear. We can teach you to become truly invisible. Invisible? The ninja understands that invisibility is a matter of patience and agility. Always mind your surroundings. Ninjitsu employs explosive powders. - As weapons? - Or distractions. Theatricality and deception are powerful agents. You must become more than just a man in the mind of your opponent. - Who is he? - He was a farmer. Then he tried to take his neighbor's land and became a murderer. - Now he is a prisoner. - What'll happen to him? Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated. Criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding. Your parents' death was not your fault. It was your father's. Anger does not change the fact that your father failed to act. - The man had a gun. - Would that stop you? I've had training. The training is nothing! Will is everything! The will to act. Yield. You haven't beaten me. You have sacrificed sure footing for a killing stroke. Rub your chest. Your arms will take care of themselves. You are stronger than your father. You didn't know my father. But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger strangling the grief... ...until the memory of your loved one is just... ...poison in your veins. And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed... ...so you'd be spared your pain. I wasn't always here in the mountains. Once, I had a wife. My great love. She was taken from me. Like you, I was forced to learn there are those without decency... ...who must be fought without hesitation, without pity. Your anger gives you great power. But if you let it, it will destroy you... ...as it almost did me. - What stopped it? - Vengeance. That's no help to me. Why, Bruce? Why could you not avenge your parents? Will you be heading back to Princeton after the hearing, sir... ...or can I persuade you to stay on for a day or two? I'm not heading back at all. - You don't like it there? - I like it fine. They just don't feel the same way. - I've prepared the master bedroom. - No. My room will be fine. With all due respect, sir, Wayne Manor is your house. No, Alfred, it's my father's house. - Your father is dead. - This place is a mausoleum. If I have my way, I'll pull the damn thing down brick by brick. This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered six generations of your family. Why do you give a damn, Alfred? It's not your family. I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible... ...for what was most precious to him... ...in the whole world. Miss Dawes has offered to drive you to the hearing. She probably hopes to talk you out of going. Should I just bury the past out there with my parents, Alfred? I wouldn't presume to tell you what to do with your past, sir. Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future. Haven't given up on me yet? Never. Alfred still keeps the condensed milk on the top shelf. Hasn't he noticed you're tall enough to reach now? Old habits die hard, I guess. - Never used to stop us anyway. - No, it didn't. How's your mom? She misses this place. So do I. Yeah. But it's nothing without the people who made it what it was. - Now there's only Alfred. - And you. - I'm not staying, Rachel. - You're just back for the hearing. Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way to convince you not to come. Someone at this proceeding... ...should stand for my parents. We all loved your parents, Bruce. - What Chill did is unforgivable. - Then why is your boss letting him go? In prison, he shared a cell with Carmine Falcone. He learned things, and he will testify in exchange for early parole. Rachel, this man killed my parents. I cannot let that pass. And I need you to understand that, please. Okay. The depression hit working people, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all. His crime was appalling, yes, but it was motivated not by greed... ...but by desperation. Given the years served, as well as his extraordinary level of cooperation... ...with one of this office's most important investigations... ...we strongly endorse his petition for early release. Mr. Chill? Your Honor... ...not a day goes by that I don't wish I could take back what I did. Sure, I was desperate, like a lot of people back then... ...but that don't change what I did. I gather there is a member of the Wayne family here today. Has he got anything to say? - He's coming out the side! - He's coming out the side, guys! Bruce Wayne! Joe! Hey, Joe! Falcone says hi. Come on, Bruce. We don't need to see this. I do. The DA couldn't understand why Judge Faden... ...insisted on making the hearing public. Falcone paid him off to get Chill out in the open. Maybe I should thank them. - You don't mean that. - What if I do, Rachel? My parents deserved justice. You're not talking about justice. You're talking about revenge. - Sometimes, they're the same. - No, they're never the same. Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better. - It's why we have an impartial system. - Your system is broken. You care about justice? Look beyond your own pain, Bruce. This city is rotting. They talk about the depression as if it's history. It's not. Things are worse than ever here. Falcone floods our streets with crime and drugs... ...preying on the desperate, creating new Joe Chills every day. Falcone may not have killed your parents, Bruce... ...but he's destroying everything that they stood for. You wanna thank him for that? Here you go. We all know where to find him. As long as he keeps the bad people rich... ...and the good people scared, no one'll touch him. Good people like your parents, who'll stand against injustice, they're gone. What chance does Gotham have when the good people do nothing? - I'm not one of your good people, Rachel. - What do you mean? All these years, I wanted to kill him. Now I can't. Your father would be ashamed of you. You're taller than you look in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne. No gun? I'm insulted. - You could've just sent a thank-you note. - I didn't come here to thank you. I came to show you that not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you. Only those who know me, kid. Look around you. You'll see two councilmen... ...a union official, couple off-duty cops... ...and a judge. I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them. Now, that's power you can't buy. That's the power of fear. I'm not afraid of you. Because you think you got nothing to lose. But you haven't thought it through. You haven't thought about your lady friend in the DA's office. You haven't thought about your old butler. People from your world... ...have so much to lose. Now, you think because your mommy and your daddy got shot... ...you know about the ugly side of life, but you don't. You've never tasted desperate. You're... You're Bruce Wayne, the prince of Gotham. You'd have to go miles to meet someone who didn't know your name. So don't come here with your anger, trying to prove something to yourself. This is a world you'll never understand. And you always fear... ...what you don't understand. All right. Yeah, you got spirit, kid. I'll give you that. More than your old man anyway. In the joint, Chill told me about the night he killed your parents. He said your father begged for mercy. Begged. Like a dog. Should've tipped better. - For what? - Your jacket. Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it. It's a nice coat. Be careful who sees you with that. - They're gonna come looking for me. - Who? Everyone. It's... It's a nice coat. When you lived among the criminals, did you start to pity them? The first time I stole so that I wouldn 't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled... ...I learned the fear before a crime... ...and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them. Fool. What do I care what your name is? You're a criminal. Tell that to the guy who owned these. You've traveled the world to understand the criminal mind and conquer your fears. But a criminal is not complicated. And what you really fear is inside yourself. You fear your own power. You fear your anger... ...the drive to do great or terrible things. Now you must journey inwards. You are ready. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe in your fears. Face them. To conquer fear, you must become fear. You must bask in the fear of other men. And men fear most what they cannot see. You have to become a terrible thought. A wraith. You have to become an idea! Feel terror cloud your senses. Feel its power to distort. To control. And know that this power can be yours. Embrace your worst fear. Become one with the darkness. Focus. Concentrate. Master your senses. You cannot leave any sign. I haven't. Impressive. We have purged your fear. You are ready to lead these men. You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows. But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice. No. I'm no executioner. Your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share. That's why it's so important. It separates us from them. You want to fight criminals. This man is a murderer. - This man should be tried. - By whom? Corrupt bureaucrats? Criminals mock society's laws. You know this better than most. You cannot lead these men... ...unless you are prepared to do what is necessary to defeat evil. And where would I be leading these men? Gotham. As Gotham's favored son... ...you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality. - How? - Gotham's time has come. Like Constantinople or Rome before it... ...the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice. It is beyond saving and must be allowed to die. This is the most important function of the League of Shadows. It is one we've performed for centuries. Gotham... ...must be destroyed. You can't believe in this. Ra's al Ghul rescued us from the darkest corners of our own hearts. What he asks in return is the courage to do what is necessary. I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men like this... ...but I will not become an executioner. Bruce, please. For your own sake, there is no turning back. - What are you doing? - What's necessary, my friend. I will tell him you saved his life. Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time. - Yes, I have. - You look very fashionable. Apart from the mud. Are you coming back to Gotham for long, sir? As long as it takes. I want to show the people... ...their city doesn't belong to the criminals and the corrupt. In the depression, your father nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises... ...combating poverty. He believed his example could inspire the wealthy of Gotham to save their city. Did it? In a way. Their murder shocked the wealthy and the powerful into action. People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy. I can't do that as Bruce Wayne. As a man... ...I'm flesh and blood, I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol... As a symbol, I can be incorruptible. - I can be everlasting. - What symbol? Something elemental... ...something terrifying. I assume that as you take on the underworld... ...this symbol is a persona to protect those you care about from reprisals? You're thinking about Rachel? Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself. Have you told anyone I'm coming back? I couldn't figure the legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead. - Dead? - You've been gone seven years. You had me declared dead? Actually, it was Mr. Earle. He's taking the company public. He wanted to liquidate your majority shareholding. Those shares are worth quite a bit of money. Well, it's a good thing I left everything to you, then. Quite so, sir. And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like. Just bring it back with a full tank. In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much a danger to himself as to others... ...and prison is probably not the best environment for his rehabilitation. - Dr. Crane. - Miss Dawes. You think a man who butchers people for the mob doesn't belong in jail? I would hardly have testified to that otherwise, would I? This is the third of Falcone's thugs you've had declared insane... ...and moved into your asylum. The work offered by organized crime must have an attraction to the insane. Or the corrupt. Mr. Finch. You should check with Miss Dawes here... ...just what implications your office has authorized her to make. If any. - What are you doing? - What are you doing, Carl? Looking out for you. Falcone has half the city bought and paid for. - Drop it. - How can you say that? Because as much as I care about getting Falcone, I care more about you. That's sweet. We've been through all that. Blessed bat again, sir. They nest somewhere in the grounds. No more favors. Someone is sniffing around. Hey, I scratch your back, you scratch mine, doc. I'm bringing in the shipments. We are paying you for that. Maybe money isn't as interesting to me as favors. I am more than aware that you are not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone. But you know who I'm working for, and when he gets here... He... He's coming to Gotham? Yes, he is. And when he gets here, he's not going to wanna hear... ...that you've endangered our operation just to get your thugs out of jail time. - Who's bothering you? - There's a girl at the DA's office. - We'll buy her off. - Not this one. Idealist, huh? Well, there's an answer to that too. - I don't want to know. - Yes, you do. No, we are showing very healthy growth in these sectors. I don't think Thomas Wayne would have viewed heavy-arms manufacture... ...as a suitable cornerstone for our business. Well, that's years ago, Fredericks. I think after years we can allow ourselves... ...to stop thinking about what Thomas Wayne would have done. Good morning, Mr. Earle's office. Yes, he's confirmed for the dinner tomorrow evening. Good morning. I'm here to see Mr. Earle. Name? Bruce Wayne. Thomas would probably not have taken the company public. But that is what we, as responsible managers, are going to do. Jessica? Jessica? Where are you? - Eye on the ball, and... - Why is no one answering the phone? It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle. I'm sure they'll call back. Bruce? You're supposed to be dead. I'm sorry to disappoint. - I need you to take a look at this. - Have you seen him yet? - Who? - Wayne. It's been all over the news. He's back. I'm sure you realize I can't stop the big machine. Too many wheels turning. - We're going public. - I understand. And I'll be handsomely rewarded for my shares. I'm not looking to interfere. - I am looking for a job. - Oh? I just want to get to know the company that my family built. Any ideas where you would start? Applied Sciences caught my eye. Fox's department. I'll let him know you're coming. You look like him. Your dad. You're the only one left of the Wayne family. This is where you belong. Welcome home. Environmental procedures, defense projects, consumer products. All prototypes. None in production. - On any level whatsoever. - None? What did they tell you this place was? They didn't tell me anything. Earle told me exactly what it was when he sent me down here. Dead end. Place to keep me from causing the board any more trouble. Come on. - You were on the board? - When your father ran things. - You knew my father? - Oh, yeah. Helped him build his train. Here we are. Kevlar utility harness. Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun. The 350-pound test monofilament. Wonderful project, your dad's train. Routed it right into Wayne Tower, along with the water and power utilities. Kind of made Wayne Tower the unofficial center of Gotham City. Of course, Earle let it go to rot. Here we are. Nomex survival suit for advanced infantry. Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints. - Tear-resistant? - This sucker will stop a knife. - Bulletproof? - Anything but a straight shot. - Why didn't they put it into production? - Bean counters didn't think... ...a soldier's life was worth grand. So, what's your interest in it, Mr. Wayne? I want to borrow it. For spelunking. Spelunking? Yeah, you know, cave diving? You expecting to run into much gunfire in these caves? Look, I'd rather Mr. Earle didn't know about me borrowing... Mr. Wayne... ...the way I see it... ...all this stuff is yours anyway. Okay. Give it a try. Charming. At least you'll have company. This must be the lowest foundation of the southeast wing. Your great-great-grandfather was involved in the Underground Railroad... ...secretly transporting freed slaves to the North... ...and I suspect these caverns came in handy. Alfred! Come up here! I can see everything all right from down here, sir, thank you. We order the main part of this cowl from Singapore. Via a dummy corporation. Indeed. And then, quite separately... ...we place an order to a Chinese company for these. - Put it together ourselves. - Precisely. They'll have to be large orders, to avoid suspicion. - How large? - Say 10,000. - Well, at least we'll have spares. - Yes. Don't suppose you want a taste. I just keep offering, thinking maybe someday you'll get wise. There's nothing wise in what you do, Flass. Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste, makes us guys nervous. I'm no rat. In a town this bent, who's there to rat to anyway? Don't turn around. You're a good cop. One of the few. What do you want? Carmine Falcone brings in shipments of drugs every week. Nobody takes him down. Why? He's paid up with the right people. What will it take to bring him down? Leverage on Judge Faden... ...and a DA brave enough to prosecute. Rachel Dawes. Who are you? Watch for my sign. You're just one man? Now we're two. We? Freeze! What the hell was that? Just some nut. Well, what is it today? More spelunking? No. Today it's BASE-jumping. BASE-jumping. - That like parachuting? - Kind of. Do you have any lightweight fabrics? You know, I think I have just the thing. It's called memory cloth. Notice anything? Regularly flexible... ...but put a current through it... ...molecules realign, it becomes rigid. - What kind of shapes can you make? Can be tailored to fit any structure based on a rigid skeleton. Too expensive for the Army? I don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd. - Look, Mr. Fox. - Yes, sir? If you're uncomfortable... Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing... ...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie. But don't think of me as an idiot. Fair enough. What's that? The Tumbler? Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that. She was built as a bridging vehicle. During combat, two of these would jump over a river, towing cables. Over here on the throttle, flip that open and throttle up. This will boost you into a rampless jump... Not now! Not... Not now, sir. Afterburner disengaged. We never could get the damn bridge to work... ...but this baby works just fine. So, what do you think? Does it come in black? I need you at the docks Thursday. - Problems? - I don't want any trouble... ...with the last shipment. - Sure. Word on the street is you got a beef with somebody in the DA's office. - Is that right? - And that there's a fat prize... ...waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it. So, what's your point, Mr. Flass? Have you seen the girl? It's a cute little assistant D A. Don 't you think that's a little too much heat to bring down, maybe? - Even for this town. - Never underestimate Gotham City. People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week. Sometimes... Sometimes things just go bad. It's a problem with the graphite, sir. The next 10,000 will be up to specifications. - At least they gave us a discount. - Quite. In the meantime, sir, may I suggest you try to avoid landing on your head? Why bats, Master Wayne? Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread. What is this? Continue. Looks fine out there. The bears go straight to the dealers. Yeah, and the rabbits go to the man in the Narrows. - What's the difference? - Ignorance is bliss, my friend. Don't burden yourself with the secrets of scary people. Hey. Steiss. Steiss? What? What the...? I better check it. There's a problem out here. You better bail. Where are you?! Here. Get going. Oh, shit. What the hell are you? I'm Batman. Nice coat. Thanks. Hold it. That's right, you better run. Falcone sent them to kill you. - Why? - You rattled his cage. - What's this? - Leverage. - For what? - To get things moving. Who are you? Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages. Ma'am? Everything okay? - Falcone's men? - Does it matter? We'll never tie him to it anyway. I wouldn't be too sure of that. What the hell is that? Cut him down. Unacceptable. Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs, Guardian Angels... ...or the goddamn Salvation Army... ...get them off the street and off the front page. They say it was just one guy. Or a creature. It was some asshole in a costume. - Yeah? - This guy did deliver us... ...one of the city's biggest crime lords. No one takes the law into their own hands in my city. Understand? - No way to bury it now. - There's still Judge Faden. - I've got Faden covered. - What about this bat they babble about? Even if these guys will swear to being thrashed by a giant bat... ...we've got Falcone at the scene. Drugs, prints, cargo manifests. This bat character gave us everything. Okay. Let's do it. - Bats are nocturnal. - Bats may be. But even for billionaire playboys, 3:00 is pushing it. The price for leading a double life, I fear. Your theatrics made an impression. Theatricality and deception... ...are powerful weapons, Alfred. This is a good start. If those are to be the first of many injuries to come... ...it would be wise to find a suitable excuse. Polo, for instance. I'm not learning polo, Alfred. Strange injuries, a nonexistent social life. These things beg the question... ...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne do with his time and his money. What does someone like me do? Drive sports cars, date movie stars. Buy things that are not for sale. Who knows, Master Wayne, you start pretending to have fun... ...you might even have a little by accident. Sir. - We have a situation. - All right. The Coast Guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night... ...heavily damaged, all crew missing, probably dead. The ship was carrying a prototype weapon. It's a microwave emitter. It's designed for desert warfare, but it... It looks like somebody... ...turned it on. It uses focused microwaves to vaporize the enemy's water supply. The damage to the ship was catastrophic. The weapon itself is... Missing? Yeah. Mr. Wayne. Nice car. You should see my other one. He's done something the police never have. You can't take the law into your own hands. Well, at least he's getting something done. Bruce, help me out here. Well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues. But he's put Falcone behind bars. And now the cops want him. What does that tell you? They're jealous. Sir, the pool is for decoration... ...and your friends do not have swimwear. Well, they're European. I'm going to have to ask you to leave. - It is not a question of money. - Well, you see... ...I'm buying this hotel... ...and setting some new rules about the pool area. I think the Batman deserves a medal. And a straitjacket to pin it on. Thank you. Bruce? Rachel? I'd heard you were back. What are you doing? Just swimming here. Wow, it is good to see you. You were gone a long time. - I know. How are things? - The same. Job's getting worse. Can't change the world on your own. What choice do I have... ...when you're too busy swimming? Rachel, all of... All this... It's... It's not me. It's... Inside, I am... I am more. Come on, Bruce. Come on. Bruce, we have some more hotels for you to buy. Bruce... ...deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be. But it's not who you are underneath... ...it's what you do that defines you. Dr. Crane, thanks for coming. Not at all. He cut his wrists? Probably looking for the insanity plea. But if anything should happen... Of course, better safe than sorry. Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore. It's all too much. The walls are closing in. Blah, blah, blah. A couple of days of this food, it'll be true. - What do you want? - I wanna know... ...how you're gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut. About what? You don't know anything. I know you don't want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized. And I know about your experiments with the inmates of your nut house. See, I don't go into business with a guy without finding out his dirty secrets. And those goons you used. I own the muscle in this town. Now, I've been bringing your stuff in for months... ...so whatever he's planning, it's big, and I want in. Well, I already know what he'll say. That we should kill you. Even he can't get me in here. Not in my town. Would you like to see my mask? I use it in my experiments. Now, I'm probably not very frightening to a guy like you. But these crazies, they can't stand it. So when did the nut take over the nut house? They scream and they cry... ...much as you're doing now. Well, he's not faking. Not that one. I'll talk to the judge and see if I can get him moved... ...to the secure wing at Arkham. I can't treat him here. Storm's coming. The scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone. It's a start. Your partner was at the docks with Falcone. Well, he moonlights as a low-level enforcer. They were splitting the shipment in two. Only half went to the dealers. Why? What about the other half? - Flass knows. - He won't talk. He'll talk to me. Commissioner Loeb set up a massive task force to catch you. - He thinks you're dangerous. - What do you think? I think you're trying to help. But I've been wrong before. Come on, I ain't got all night. Flass, I have kids to feed. What, they don't like falafel? Where were the other drugs going? I never knew. I don't know. - I swear to God. - Swear to me! I don't... I don't know. I never knew. Never. They went to some guy for a couple days before they went to the dealers. Why? There was something... Something else in the drugs... ...something hidden. - What? I never went to the drop-off point. It was in the Narrows. - Cops only go there in force. - Do I look like a cop? No... This is the one I'm talking about. - What's your problem with it? - It shouldn't exist. This ship left Singapore with containers, but arrived with 247. I'm guessing there's something I'm not supposed to find in there. Listen, counselor, we don't wanna know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate. Things are working a little differently now. Open it up. What the hell is this? It's you, isn't it? Everybody's been talking about you. Get in here! The other kids won't believe me. Get rid of all traces. - Better torch the whole place. - All right. Having trouble? Take a seat. Have a drink. You look like a man who takes himself too seriously. Do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up. Alfred, help me. Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison. Poisonous. Poisonous. Bruce... ...why do we fall? - How long was I out? - Two days. It's your birthday. Many happy returns. I've felt these effects before, but this was so much more potent. It was some kind of hallucinogen, weaponized, in aerosol form. You have been hanging out in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne. I called Mr. Fox when your condition worsened after the first day. I analyzed your blood... ...isolating the receptor compounds and the protein-based catalyst. Am I meant to understand any of that? Not at all. I just wanted you to know how hard it was. - Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote. - Could you make more? You planning on gassing yourself again, Mr. Wayne? Well, you know how it is. You're out at night, looking for kicks... ...someone's passing around the weaponized hallucinogens... I'll bring what I have. The antidote should inoculate you for now. Alfred, always a pleasure. Lucius. - You sure you don't want to come in? - I have to get back. - I wanted to leave this. - Thank you. Rachel? Looks like someone's been burning the candle at both ends. - Must've been quite an occasion. - It is my birthday. I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight. I was just dropping off your present. - You've got better plans? - My boss has been missing for days... ...which means I should probably start by looking at the bottom of the river. - Rachel. - Excuse me. Rachel Dawes. Who authorized that? Get Crane down there now. Don't take no for an answer. Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our own assessment to the judge by morning. - What's wrong? - It's Falcone. Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum on suicide watch. You're going to Arkham now? It's in the Narrows, Rachel. You enjoy your party, Bruce. - Some of us have work to do. - You be careful. Happy birthday. But, Master Wayne, the guests will be arriving. Keep them happy until I arrive. Tell them that joke you know. Having fun? Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you doing in a place like this? I need some information. The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, -ME. -ME. It's a microwave emitter. It was designed to vaporize an enemy's water supply. Rumor was they tested dispersing water-based chemicals into the air... ...but isn't that illegal? I want all the information on the development of this project... ...all data, files, backup disks, on my desk right away. Did you lose one? I'm merging your department with Archives. And I am firing you. Didn't you get the memo? Scarecrow. Scarecrow. Scarecrow. Miss Dawes, this is most irregular. I have nothing to add to the report I filed with the judge. - I have questions about your report. - Such as? Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man who has no history of mental illness... ...to have a psychotic breakdown just when he's about to be indicted? As you can see for yourself, there is nothing convenient about his symptoms. - Scarecrow. - What's ""scarecrow""? Patients suffering delusional episodes often focus their paranoia... ...on an external tormentor... ...usually one conforming to Jungian archetypes. In this case, a scarecrow. - He's drugged? - Psychopharmacology is my primary field. I'm a strong advocate. Outside, he was a giant. In here, only the mind can grant you power. You enjoy the reversal. I respect the mind's power over the body. It's why I do what I do. I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone behind bars, not in therapy. I want my own psychiatric consultant to have full access to Falcone... ...including blood work. Find out what exactly you put him on. - First thing tomorrow, then. - Tonight. I've already paged Dr. Lehmann at County General. As you wish. This way, please. There's something I think you should see. This is where we make the medicine. Perhaps you should have some, clear your head. Who knows you're here? Who knows? He's here. Who? The Batman. - What do we do? - What anyone does... ...when a prowler comes around. - Call the police. - You want the cops here? At this point, they can't stop us. But the Batman has a talent for disruption. Force him outside, the police will take him down. Go. - What about her? - She hasn't got long. I gave her a concentrated dose. The mind can only take so much. Now go. The things they say about him. Can he really fly? I heard he can disappear. Well, we'll find out. Won't we? Taste of your own medicine, doctor? What have you been doing here? Who are you working for? Ra's... Ra's al Ghul. Ra's al Ghul is dead. Who are you working for? Crane. Dr. Crane isn't here right now. But if you'd like to make an appointment... Batman, put down your weapons and surrender. You're surrounded. - What are you waiting for? - Backup. - Backup? - The Batman's in there. SWAT's on the way. But if you wanna go in now... ...I'll be right behind you, sir. SWAT's on the way. - Hey. - Hey. What's happened to her? Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin. - Let me get her down to the medics. - They can't help her, but I can. Get her downstairs. Meet me in the alley. Crane's been smuggling his toxin hidden in Falcone's drugs... ...and they're dumping it into the water supply. - What was he planning? - I don't know. Was he working for Falcone? He mentioned someone else, someone worse. She needs the antidote before the damage is permanent. - How long does she have? - Not long. What is that? - Backup. - What the...? Excuse me. - How is she? - She's fading. We gotta go. I'll get my car. I brought mine. Yours? I've gotta get me one of those. - He is in a vehicle. - Make and color? It's a black... ...tank. Stay calm. You've been poisoned. I'm on him. Breathe slowly. Hold on. - What are you doing? - Shortcut. Air One to ground, block that ramp. He's got no way off that roof. Turn off your engine. Step away from the car. - Trust me. - Weapons system activated. Who is this guy? - Where's he going? - He's on the roof. - What street is he taking? - He's not on a street. He's flying on rooftops. At least tell me what it looks like. Never mind. Got him. Coming right up on his butt. We're tracking suspect vehicle heading west on I- 17. - Air One to ground. - I lost him. We've lost visual. Exit is blocked. We'll loop back to check the frontage road. Stealth mode activated. Stay with me. What...? There he is. Just hold on. Rachel! - They get any of this into the mains? - Yeah. Notify the water company. There's gotta be a way to isolate it. No. They put it all in. They must've been at this for weeks. - Gotham's entire water supply is laced. - Why haven't we felt the effects? Must be a compound that has to be absorbed through the lungs. How do you feel? Where are we? - Why did you bring me here? - If I hadn't, your mind would be lost. - You were poisoned. - It was... - It was Dr. Crane. - Rest. Gordon has Crane. Is Sergeant Gordon your friend? I don't have the luxury of friends. I'm gonna give you a sedative. You'll wake up back at home. When you do, get these to Gordon, and Gordon alone. Trust no one. - What are they? - The antidote. One for Gordon to inoculate himself, the other for mass production. Mass production? Crane was just a pawn. We need to be ready. When you told me your grand plan for saving Gotham... ...all that stopped me from calling the men in white coats... ...was when you said it wasn't about thrill-seeking. - It's not. - What would you call that? - Damn good television. - It's a miracle no one was killed. I didn't have time to observe the rules of the road, Alfred. You're getting lost inside this monster of yours. I'm using this monster to help other people, just like my father did. For Thomas Wayne, helping others... ...wasn't about proving anything to anyone, including himself. It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying. She's downstairs, sedated. I need you to take her home. Well, we both care for Rachel, but what you're doing has to be beyond that. It can't be personal, or you're just a vigilante. - Is Fox still here? - Yes, sir. We need to send these people away. Those are Bruce Wayne's guests. You have a name to maintain. I don't care about my name. It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name. And it's all that's left of him. Don't destroy it. - Mr. Earle. - Happy birthday, Bruce. Thank you. How did the stock offering go? Prices soared. Who was buying? All kinds of funds and brokerages. It's a bit technical. The key thing is... ...our company's future is secure. Great. A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid. What was the plan, Crane? How were you gonna get your toxin into the air? Scarecrow. Scarecrow. Who were you working for, Crane? Oh, it's too late. You can't stop it now. Here. - Happy birthday, Bruce. - Thank you. Thanks. And thank you for that item. You're welcome. - I know you'll put it to good use. - I already have. How long would it take to manufacture on a large scale? Weeks. Why? Somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply. The water supply won't help you disperse an inhalant. What? Unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough... ...to vaporize all the water in the mains. A microwave emitter like the one Wayne Enterprises just misplaced. Misplaced? Earle just fired me for asking too many questions about it. Go back to Wayne Enterprises now and start making more of that antidote. The police are gonna need as much as they can get their hands on. My security clearance has been revoked. That wouldn't stop a man like you, would it? I suppose not. - Bruce, there's somebody you must meet. - Not now, Mrs. Delane. Now, am I pronouncing this right... ...Mr. Ra's al Ghul? You're not Ra's al Ghul. I watched him die. But is Ra's al Ghul immortal? Are his methods supernatural? Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ra's? Surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham... ...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities. I saved your life. I warned you about compassion, Bruce. Your quarrel is with me. You let these people go. You are welcome to explain the situation to them. Everyone. Everybody? I... I want to thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze. No, really. There's a thing about being a Wayne... ...that you're never short of a few freeloaders, like yourselves... ...to fill up your mansion with. So here's to you people. Thank you. - That's enough, Bruce. - I'm not finished. To all of you... All of you phonies, all of you two-faced friends... ...you sycophantic suck-ups who smile through your teeth at me... ...please, leave me in peace. Please go. Stop smiling, it's not a joke. Please leave. The party's over, get out. The apple has fallen very far from the tree, Mr. Wayne. He's turning into a jerk. Amusing. But pointless. None of these people have long to live. Your antics at the asylum have forced my hand. So Crane was working for you. His toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers. He was able to weaponize it. He's not a member of the League of Shadows? Of course not. He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom. But really, you are gonna release Crane's poison on the entire city. Then watch Gotham tear itself apart through fear. You're gonna destroy millions of lives. Only a cynical man would call what these people have ""lives,"" Wayne. Crime. Despair. This is not how man was supposed to live. The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption... ...for thousands of years. We sacked Rome. Loaded trade ships with plague rats. Burned London to the ground. Every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence... ...we return to restore the balance. Gotham isn't beyond saving. Give me more time. There are good people here. You're defending a city so corrupt... ...we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure. Time to play. When I found you in that jail, you were lost. But I believed in you. I took away your fear, and I showed you a path. You were my greatest student. It should be you standing by my side, saving the world. I'll be standing where I belong. Between you and the people of Gotham. No one can save Gotham. When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural. Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself. The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time. - You attacked Gotham before? - Of course. Over the ages our weapons have grown more sophisticated. With Gotham we tried a new one. Economics. But we underestimated certain of Gotham's citizens... ...such as your parents. Gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help. Create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal. Their deaths galvanized the city into saving itself... ...and Gotham has limped on ever since. We are back to finish the job. And this time no misguided idealists will get in the way. Like your father, you lack the courage to do all that is necessary. If someone stands in the way of true justice... ...you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart. - I am gonna stop you. - You never did learn... ...to mind your surroundings. Justice is balance. You burned my house and left me for dead. Consider us even. No one comes out. Make sure. They're all gone? - How many from maximum security? - Every one of them. Serial killers, rapists. Raise the bridges. We don't want any getting off the island. Yeah, I'll raise the bridges... ...when I get every available unit out here to catch the homicidal maniacs... ...that are running loose out there. - Come on! I hope you're not a member of the fire brigade. Master Wayne! Master Wayne! What is the point of all those pushups if you can't even lift a bloody log? What have I done, Alfred? Everything my family... ...my father, built... The Wayne legacy is more than bricks and mortar, sir. I wanted to save Gotham. I failed. Why do we fall, sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up. You still haven't given up on me? Never. Down! Harassment! I see harassment! Maybe you'd like to see some excessive force? Madman with a gun. With residents furious at the unprecedented show of police strength... ...to round up the inmates... - We're about to raise these bridges. Officer, I am a Gotham City district attorney. Let me pass. - Just shut up! - Hey, Flass, cool it! Hold these people back. Hey, Gordon. Somebody here to see you. - What are you doing here? - Our friend sent me with this. It counteracts Crane's toxin. Hopefully you won't need it. Not unless he's got some way of getting that crap into the air. All right, last one across. People, they want this bridge up in no more than three minutes! Better get you off the island before they raise the bridges. Patrolman! Go! I can't find my mom. Hey! What the hell are you doing? Gentlemen... ...time to spread the word. And the word is... ...panic. Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking. Right there. That water main is right under the Narrows. It's okay. This is Commissioner Loeb. Come on, somebody talk to me. Come on! Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon. What the hell is going on? We need reinforcements. TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops! Gordon! All the city's riot police are on the island with you! Well, they're completely incapacitated! It's okay, it's okay. No one's gonna hurt you. Of course they are! - Crane? - No. Scarecrow. Gordon... ...there's nobody left to send in. So I'm on my own? The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces. This is just the beginning. If they hit the whole city... ...there's nothing to stop Gotham tearing itself apart. - How are they gonna do that? - The train. The monorail follows the water mains to the central hub beneath Wayne Tower. If the machine gets to the station... ...it'll cause a chain reaction that'll vaporize the city's water supply. Covering Gotham in this poison. I'm gonna stop him from loading that train, but I may need your help. - What do you need? - Can you drive stick? There you are! There is nothing to fear... ...but fear itself! I am here to help! Batman will save us. He'll come. - He'll come. - Don't peek. This is Gordon. Prepare to lower the bridge. I told you he'd come. Wait. You could die. At least tell me your name. It's not who I am underneath... ...but what I do that defines me. Bruce? Well, well. You took my advice about theatricality a bit literally. - It ends here. - For you and the police, maybe. My fight, however, lies with the rest of Gotham. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a city to destroy. - I can't beat two of your pawns? - As you wish. GPS online. In yards. Gentlemen. Who the hell authorized this? Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles. The pressure's moving along the mains, blowing the pipes. If that pressure reaches us... ...the water supply right across the whole city is gonna blow! At the next intersection, turn right. You will never learn. Sorry. - Familiar. Don't you have anything new? - How about this?! You have arrived at Wayne Tower. Evacuate the building. We're on top of the main hub and it's gonna blow. Weapons system activated. Nice ride. Armed. Don't be afraid, Bruce. Come on. Come on. You are just an ordinary man in a cape. That's why you couldn't fight injustice, that's why you can't stop this train. Who said anything about stopping it? Yes! You never learned to mind your surroundings! Have you finally learned to do what is necessary? I won't kill you... ...but I don't have to save you. - The meeting's already started. - What meeting? Fox, I seem to remember firing you. You did. I got another job. Yours. On whose authority? Batman may have made the front page... ...but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight. Bruce Wayne. What makes you think you can decide who's running Wayne Enterprises? - The fact that I'm the owner. - What are you talking about? The company went public a week ago. And I bought most of the shares. Through various charitable foundations and trusts and so forth. Look, it's all a bit technical, but the important thing... ...is that my company's future is secure. Right, Mr. Fox? Right you are, Mr. Wayne. Didn't you get the memo? - I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel. - No. No, Bruce... ...I'm sorry. The day that Chill died, I... I said terrible things. But true things. I was a coward with a gun... ...and justice is about more than revenge, so thank you. I never stopped thinking about you. About us. And when I heard you were back, I... I started to hope. But then I found out about your mask. Batman's just a symbol, Rachel. No. This... ...is your mask. Your real face is the one that criminals now fear. The man I loved... ...the man who vanished... ...he never came back at all. But maybe he's still out there somewhere. Maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman... ...I'll see him again. - Proved me wrong, you know. - About what? Your father would be very proud of you. Just like me. What will you do? Rebuild it. Just the way it was, brick for brick. Just the way it was, sir? Yeah, why? I thought this might be a good opportunity for... ...improving the foundations. - In the southeast corner? - Precisely, sir. - Nice. - I couldn't find any mob bosses. - Well, sergeant? - It's ""lieutenant"" now. You really started something. Bent cops running scared. Hope on the streets. - But? - The Narrows is lost. And we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed. We will. We can bring Gotham back. - What about escalation? - Escalation? We start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics. We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor-piercing rounds. - And? - And you're wearing a mask... ...and jumping off rooftops. Now, take this guy. Armed robbery, double homicide. Got a taste for the theatrical, like you. Leaves a calling card. I'll look into it. I never said thank you. And you'll never have to."
5,2002,Scooby-Doo,American,"The members of Mystery, Inc. solve the case of the Luna Ghost at the Wow-O-Toy Factory. However, long-time friction between Fred Jones, a glory hog, Daphne Blake, who is fed up with getting kidnapped at every mystery, and Velma Dinkley, who is never credited for her ideas, finally boils over and the gang breaks up, leaving Shaggy Rogers and his dog Scooby-Doo heartbroken.
Two years later, Shaggy and Scooby are invited to solve a mystery on the popular resort Spooky Island, owned by Emile Mondavarious. At the airport, the pair are unexpectedly reunited with the rest of Mystery, Inc. – Fred has become a popular author, Velma works for NASA, and Daphne has undertaken martial arts to avoid being kidnapped again. However, while Shaggy and Scooby are thrilled with the reunion, the other three refuse to work with each other, still angry about their fight that split them up.
On the flight over, Shaggy falls in love with a girl named Mary Jane, who loves Scooby Snacks like him, but is allergic to dogs. Upon arriving at the island, the gang meet Mondavarious, who claims the visiting tourists have been cursed into a brainwashed state. Velma attends a ritualistic performance hosted by N'Goo Tuana and his henchman, Zarkos, a famous luchador. N'Goo claims the island was once ruled by ancient demons till Mondavarious built the resort, and they plot their revenge.
Because of a misunderstanding when talking to a local voodoo priest, Daphne, Shaggy, and Scooby venture into the resort's ghost ride, meeting Fred and Velma inside, where they split up to look for clues. Fred and Velma come across a strange school designed to educate inhuman creatures about human culture, while Daphne discovers a pyramid-shaped artifact called the Daemon Ritus. The gang flee to the hotel, but an army of real demons attack, kidnapping Fred, Velma, Mondavarious and other tourists, while Scooby, Shaggy, Daphne and Mary Jane escape.
The next day, Daphne is captured by Zarkos, who also steals the Daemon Ritus, while Shaggy and Scooby learn the tourists, Fred and Velma are possessed by the demons. They run into Mary Jane, but Scooby realizes she is possessed too. Shaggy and Scooby argue when the latter points it out, but he falls down a hole into an underground chamber. While trying to find him, Shaggy finds a vat of protoplasm containing the souls of everyone captured, and frees Velma, Fred, and Daphne's souls. Velma discovers the demons can be destroyed by sunlight, but Fred and Daphne become trapped in each other's wrong bodies, until the Daemon Ritus corrects it after the gang's souls swap randomly. The gang come across the voodoo priest, who explains the demons' ritual will allow them to rule the world for the next ten-thousand years when a pure soul is offered as a sacrifice — namely, Scooby. Mondavarious is revealed to be the leader of the demons.
The gang plot a trap to defeat the demon cult, but it fails, and Mondavarious sucks out Scooby's soul using the Daemon Ritus. Shaggy tackles Mondavarious; Scooby's soul goes back into him. As Fred and Velma go to confront the defeated Mondavarious, they find he is a man in a mask. When they peel the mask off, Mondavarious is revealed to be a robot piloted by Scooby's estranged nephew Scrappy-Doo, who was abandoned by the gang years ago when his ego got out of control because he urinated on Daphne. Using the absorbed souls of the tourists, Scrappy transforms into a monster and tries to kill the gang.
On the mountain top, Daphne battles Zarkos, finally kicking him into the ritual chamber where the demons are exposed to sunlight and die. Shaggy rips the Daemon Ritus from Scrappy's body, freeing the souls; the real Mondavarious emerges from a prison cell. Scrappy, N'Goo, Zarkos and all their minions are arrested, while the reunited gang promise to forever solve mysteries.
As the end credits begin to roll, Scooby and Shaggy are enjoying the ""all you can eat"" deal they were promised at the hotel. They challenge each other with eating chili peppers, and scream as smoke comes out of the hotel.",5.2,tt0267913,"Let go of me! Okay, now I really have a wedgie. Fred! Velma! Can you guys hurry it up? This ghost keeps grabbing... Please! Jinkies. Fred. Come in, Fred. -Fred! Can you hear me? -Fredster here, Velms. Shockingly, Daphne's been captured again. That's okay. When the Luna Ghost rounds the corner with Daphne... ...Shaggy and Scooby will pop out of the barrel... You'll activate the conveyor belt, spilling the oil onto the floor. Just remember my plan. Like, chill out, Scooby-Doo. Stop shaking. Me? That's you. Right. It's me. Sorry. Scooby-Doo, what are you doing, man? Like, this is no time to... Oh, boy. Like, there's a ghost right behind me, isn't there? Run! Go, Shaggy! Go! -Run! -Like, I'm trying, buddy! Fred, now! Hurry up! -I got him. -Look out! Sorry! -Sorry, Velma. -I know, Fred. -Where's the ghost? -He's right behind us. Skateboard! Is he still after us, Scoob? Banzai! -Zoinks! Grab the hook! -Hold on, Shaggy! Daphne, are you okay? I'm so over this damsel-in-distress nonsense. Where's Shagster? -Like, I'm right here, man. -Me too. Scoob, that was fun. Let's grab another skateboard and do it again. Yeah. There you go. One for you. Good-Iooking guy. All right, nice to see you. -Thanks for saving the factory. -Pam, any comments? This is a victory for any celebrity who wants to make a quality action figure. -What's the secret of your success? -Teamwork. I do a tremendous amount of teamwork, and I always have a plan. Come on. Yeah, my plan. I knew from the start there was no phantom. The Luna Ghost is, in fact... -Old Man Smithers? -The creepy janitor? He wanted revenge after you refused to go out with him. How could you, Pam? I'm a lover-boy of George Clooney-an proportions. -Fred, how was the ghost able to fly? -I can answer that. Watch. These balloons fill with a highly potent helium synthesis... ...giving the Luna Ghost... ...his weightless appearance. I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids... ...and your dumb dog! I'll get you for this! Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Fred, I can't believe you took credit for my plan again. Some plan. That ghost pawed me for an hour and a half. It's not our fault you always get kidnapped. I don't always get kidnapped. Can't believe you'd say that. Oh, please. You come with your own ransom note. -My glasses! -Who's helpless now? I'm going to kill you, Daphne! Watch the ascot! You guys, look, I know I'm just the dude that carries the bags... ...but we all play an important part in this group. I mean, we're just like a big, delicious banana split. Fred, you're the big banana. Daphne, you're the pastrami and gum-flavored ice cream. And Velma... ...you're the sweet-and-sour mustard sauce that goes on top. That sounds pretty good, doesn't it? You know what, Shaggy? You've really put it in perspective for me. Thanks. I quit. -No. -No way. You can't quit. I was gonna quit in, like, two seconds. Now everyone will think I copied off the smart girl. Now, wait a minute. Maybe I quit. I do. Yeah, I quit. I'm out of here. Good riddance. Don't... No. Don't go. Come on, you guys, don't do this. Please don't go. Do I quit? No, Scoob... ...friends don't quit. It looks like it's just you and me for a while. What now, Shaggy? I guess we'll all just do what we do best, Scoob. This is primo. Man, talk about toasted. Man, the only thing I like better than an eggplant burger... ...is a chocolate-covered eggplant burger. With hot sauce. Yeah, just another beautiful day in paradise. I'm looking for a ""Mr. Rogers"" and a ""Mr. Doo."" The detectives? It's probably somebody looking for us to solve some scary mystery. Nobody home! Quick, Scoob-o, grab the food-o, let's scram-o. I'm looking for a ""Mr. Rogers"" and a ""Mr. Doo."" Let's go! I'm sorry, dude. I'd love to help you out. You look like a really nice guy. We're not detectives anymore. I've been sent by Mr. Emile Mondevarious to invite you... ...to his amusement park, Spooky Island. We don't go near places with ""spooky,"" ""haunted,"" or ""creepy"" in the name. -Or hydrocolonic. -Right, but that's for another reason. But he'd like you to solve a mystery. He'll pay you a fee of 10,000. It's just, materialism is not really our bag, man. -Free airfare. -No, thanks. -Room and board. -No, thanks. And all you can eat. All you can eat? Fred? Velma? Are you going this way? -How have you...? -Been? -Yes. -Great. I'm on the lecture circuit with my new book... -...Fred on Fred: The Many Faces of Me. -Jinkies, that's impressive. And yourself? I've been working at NASA, developing hydropowered missile defense systems. But, more importantly... -...I'm on a journey of self-discovery. -NASA? Charter service to Spooky Island will begin boarding momentarily. What do you mean I can't have seven carry-on bags? -That's so economy. -Crap. Oh, no. I'm not talking to you guys. -What are you doing here? -Isn't it obvious? We all received the same letter from one Emile Mondevarious... ...the reclusive owner of Spooky Island. It's not fair. I was gonna solve the mystery all by myself. -And when you get caught? -I'm a black belt now. I've transformed my body into a dangerous weapon. It's true. Far out. I guess we're, like, all going to Spooky Island, man. Where's Scooby? Hello. Sorry. They don't allow big dogs on the plane. You've got to be kidding. No one is stupid enough to believe that. Who's the ugly old broad? -Say hello to Grandma. -Aloha. Flight to Spooky Island, now boarding. I wouldn't have agreed to come if I knew. Wait, just think about it for one minute. Mystery Inc. reunites. We'll be a team again, just like the old days. So come on... ...let's do that thing where we all put our hands in, lift them up, and go: Only if Fred and Velma do it. People are watching, Shag. Yeah, Scoob, ""roo-hoo."" Come on, buddy. Now that is a beautiful work of art. Would you mind me taking a seat there next to...? To my grandma. That's my grandma. Hi, Grandma. Like, no. -Thanks. -You're welcome. Bless you. I'm sorry. My allergies. It's usually only dogs that do it. -Maybe I'd better move. -No, wait. It's probably just my grandma's perfume. Yeah, even I sometimes get a little allergic, you know. Oh, jeez. I'm pretty sure Grandma wants to go back and visit with her pal Velma. Right, Grandma? Okay. Boy, oh, boy, those sure do look like Scooby Snacks. I know they're for dogs... ...but they're 100 vegetarian, and I love them. Like, me too. Far out. I've never met another person who loves Scooby Snacks. -Me neither. -I'm Mary Jane. -Like, that's my favorite name. -Really? No way. Hello. Grandma? Velma, it's simple behavior modification. To cause a dog to discontinue any action, flick it on the nose. Observe. Scoob? See? Sit, Grandma! Bad, Grandma! Don't eat the kitty! Welcome to Spooky Island... ...the frightfully popular spring break spot for college students. Catch our Electrical Torture Parade. It's a Dead World After All. And the world famous Splatterhorn. Scooby-Doo! And the rest of Mystery Inc. It's marvelous to see you! How fanta... I'm sorry. That's the second time this week. Thank goodness. It's a new toy. I'm just getting up to speed with it. -Welcome. -Thank goodness. I was afraid I'd have to lug those to the hotel. That's what Spooky Island's about, realizing your worst fears. I'm Emile Mondevarious, the owner of this amusement park. -You seem less... -Spooky. ...than we'd have guessed. I can be pretty spooky when called upon. I can go: Claws and everything. You wouldn't want to run into me in a dark alley. -So you're the one who brought us here? -No. What brought you here was your insatiable appetite... ...for a juicy mystery. The truth is, Mystery Inc. is broken up. That's the beauty of something broken. It can be fixed. Therein lies its potential. And I need you to fix Spooky Island. What's the problem? I believe somebody's casting a spell on the students. Now listen and look around. Notice any difference between those arriving and those departing? They look like sober, well-behaved college kids. Precisely. They didn't before they came. They've changed. In other words, a magic spell. Carol! Carol, how was the island? Are you tricking on me? It's me, Brad. We've known each other since we were 3. Back off my grill, son! Carol, what are you doing? I'm terrified. The young people that come off that barge... ...the people I love the most, they're in danger. -I'm going to solve this one first. -Not before I solve it first. You'll look like total idiots when you're captured and I save you. Thank you. Marvelous. Maybe we can celebrate later by having a little spookapalooza. Spookapalooza? You haven't noticed anything unusual since you started working here? -Any weirdoes running around? -No. Welcome, dear victims. My name is N' Goo Tuana. This is my evil best pal, Zarkos. You may recognize him from Telemundo as the famous masked wrestler... ...Zarkos. This enchanted island... ...is a thoroughfare to the supernatural realm. For centuries, it was home to creatures who lived on the island undisturbed. But then... ...ten years ago... ...Emile Mondevarious... ...antagonized these ancient beings by building a theme park here. The creatures are furious, my friends. And I assure you... ...while you party... ...they plot... ...their revenge! Do my friends frighten you? They would, if it weren't for the holographic projectors... ...there, and there and there. What a smart little one. Hello, Dead Mike's. We got a ""Mr. Doo"" here? I got a call for a ""Mr. Doo."" Melvin Doo? No, Scooby. -Hello? -Got a bag... ...of hamburgers here for you. Just walk into the dark, shadowy part of the forest... ...where no one can see you. Okay. -Want a stuffed thingy? -Nobody can win those. Fred says it's a worthless talent, that I should've learned French instead. I say you don't need to know what "" Voulez-vous coucher avec moi"" means... ...to love that song. I think being good at crane machine is way cooler than French. Voilà. Nobody's ever given me a stuffed dismembered head before. Excuse me. Now I have to start my voodoo ritual all over again! Voodoo ritual? -I was about to sacrifice this chicken. -That chicken's not alive. I know. What, did you figure that out when you saw it didn't have a head? What do you want? Why you in the voodoo ritual space? I'm looking for clues as to who's behind the students' strange behavior. Here's a clue: Purple is a fall color. -It's the middle of May! -Pardon? Do yourself a favor and get off this island. Go home. Go home before evil befalls your skinny, aerobicized booty. And whatever you do... ...do not, I repeat... ...do not go into that Spooky Island castle. -You want me to go to that castle. -Didn't you hear what I said? You knew I'd do the opposite of what you said. You told me not to go to the castle so I would go... ...where you set a trap to capture me. Unless... ...you knew I'd figure it out, so you told me not to go... ...so I'd think you wanted me to go, so I wouldn't go. I'll find out what you're hiding in that castle. You watch. What in the world? Hamburgers, where are you? Hamburgers. Thank you. Shaggy! It's been really nice. Shaggy! Monster! Monster! A monster? Scooby-Doo, quit goofing around, man. I guess I should go. Bye, Scooby. Bless you. Shaggy. Scooby. No way. -Scoob and me don't do castles. -Why not? They have paintings that watch you, suits of armor you think is a statue... ...but there's a guy inside who follows you every time you turn around. -How many times did that happen? -Twelve. We're not gonna do it. That's right. Scooby? Did you hurt your paw? -Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? -Oh, boy! -And you'll be fearless? -Fearless? Hong Kong Phooey, watch the fists of fury. Here you go. Thank you. There's plenty more where that came from. Let's go before someone sees. You're not gonna stay out here alone, are you? No, thank you. Oh, boy. This place is, like, uber creepy. Yeah, uber creepy. The only thing missing is a mindless zombie. Fred, get back. I found this place. I call dibs on its clues. -I've already found some clues. -What? I followed some weird footprints here. It might be dangerous for you. If anyone messes with me, I'll open a can of Chinese whoop-ass on them. -What are you doing here? -This ride was closed for construction. It's the most likely place to hatch a plan. And I wanted to scare Daphne. Since we're all together, let's split up and look for more clues. -Daphne, you and l... -Typical. -What? -Nothing. -I was always picked last for the teams. -Okay. Daphne, exit through the entrance. Velma and I will enter through the exit. And Shaggy and Scooby... ...do whatever you guys do. Look at this, huh, Scoob? It's like a medieval Sizzler. Pinch me, I'm in heaven... -It's an expression, Scoob. -Sorry. Velma, I never meant to... Well, you know... -...pick you last. -Don't worry about it. I know you. All you care about are swimsuit models. Look, I'm a man of substance. Dorky chicks like you turn me on too. That's a compliment. Yes! Yes! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, no! And now for our dinner show. What? Watch out! -I got a bad feeling about this. -Me too. And now for the main course: You! Feast on this. Jinkies. They're moving toward us. Run! -We're trapped. -Quick, try the bookcase. -One of these has to open a passageway. -Velma, this is a ride. You got a better plan? What do we do? Do what we do best, Scoob: Eat. It's plastic. So what? You drink out of a toilet. So do you. I'm not helpless. I am helpless. I'm gonna die! We made it, Scoob. We're alive! That was weird. Fred? Are you all right? The last book. I don't feel so good. Reminds me of the time we tried to eat that guy in the hot-dog costume. Looks like some kind of school. In a spooky castle ride? Fishy. Welcome to America. I am using the language English. -Shaggy, look. -Let's check it out. Oh, boy. Lights, camera, action, huh, Scoob? Now that you're a young adult... ...you'll need to learn societal dos... ...and don'ts. Interaction between young people is polite and casual. Hey, sorry, bro. I will crush your bones into dust. Let's see how the situation should be handled. Remember, today's young people have a language all their own. Sorry, bro. No big whoop, dog. Catch that new vid on the box? True dat. I'm up to sniznuff on all popular trends. Word. It seems to be a brainwashing facility of some type. Wherever there's a brainwashing cult, there's always a power-hungry leader. -The Papa Smurf figure. -Mondevarious. Then why would he have invited us here? Jellybeans. I'll have whatever he's having. Are you challenging me? Maybe. Pull my finger. Too late. -You're in trouble. -Oh, boy. I'm not stopping till your fur is singed off. We're here to solve a mystery. Yeah, Scoob. Let's get out of here. Zoinks! Skedaddle! -I found a neat and scary clue. -Us too. This is a brainwashing facility for an evil cult. Maybe this is the secret relic thingy they worship. We'll all be relics if we don't get out of here. I got a plan. What's that smell? Sir, they found the Daemon Ritus. For your sake, they better not have gone far. It is time to summon the big muchachos. Like, oh, no! Mystery Inc. You all seem rather cheery. Good news, I hope? Mr. Mononucleosis... -Yes? -We have hit a clue smorgasbord. We have three suspects as to who's behind this evil hooty. N' Goo Tuana. He believes your park's on enchanted ground. The voodoo man, who tricked me into going to the castle. -And you. -Me? Let's split up. We'll meet in a half-hour. I'll interview employees to see if they've noticed anything odd. I'll translate these inscriptions Daphne found. I'll go research cults on the Net. I'm a suspect? Don't take it personally. It's because you creep me out. I see. Fine. Jinkies. Hey. Your friends ditch you? No, I always did the brainwork. What's this? I believe it's called the Daemon Ritus. Daemon Ritus? What's it for? This describes an old race of creatures. It's reminiscent of Pandaemonous texts, so I can make some of it out. It looks like instructions to some sort of secret ritual. It is fascinating. On the house. Nice sweater. You really dig doing this, huh? Like, clues and stuff. Certainly. Really focusing on a mystery reminds me of the old days. We were quite a crew back then. That was the best time of my life. Shaggy and Scooby... What goofballs! Kind of like they are today. And Daphne... So beautiful. She was the coolest girl at Coolsville High. Fred. He was so handsome. And he really knew how to accessorize. Sounds perfect. Yeah, but every family has one nut. Scrappy-Dappy-Doo! Ghosts don't stand a chance with me. Let me at 'em. I'll rack 'em. I'll sock 'em. For the thousandth time, there's no such thing as ghosts. Sure there are. When I find them, I'll give them a dose of puppy power! Oh, God. He's peeing on me. That little egomaniac had flipped his lid. Scrappy, I told you, no urinating on Daphne. -It was an accident. -You were marking your territory. You don't have the scrote for this job. Listen up, losers. The time has come to appoint me your unquestioned leader. Either that, or I'm out of here. What's the idea? You can't do this to me. People adore me. I'm as cute as a Powerpuff Girl. I'll get my own show. Puppy power, huh? And he wasn't even a puppy. He had a gland disorder. Help me! Help me! Monsters! Monsters! This is the most embarrassing thing you've done... ...since you cleaned your beans at Don Knotts' Christmas party. How many times do I have to tell you? There are no such things as ghouls, ghosts, goblins or monsters. Now listen up. There is absolutely... ...absolutely no such thing as... Monster! Fred! Scooby... Save Daphne. My glasses. I can't find my glasses. Help me find my glasses. Here they are. Thank you. Nice mask. Bad breath. Here. Jinkies. Velma! Come on! Velma! This is, like, the opposite of what I wanted to do today. Leave it! Stand back, sir. I'll protect you. Mr. Mondevarious! Daphne, go! Scooby-Doo, where are you? Running suitcase. Run suitcase. Run... Thank you. -Where's Scooby? -I hope he's okay. -Right here. Scooby-Dooby-Doo! -Hey, Scoob. I have a sinking feeling these dudes aren't brainwashed cult members. What do they want with the students? We need to follow them. -Say what? -Defeat them and save Fred and Velma. Sort of like my plan: Get out of here, let the creatures eat Fred and Velma. No way. Fred and Velma always figured out everything. Now it's our turn. For the first time, they're the damsels in distress, not me. -Help? -Timber. -Okay, I'm calling for help. -No. I got this. I got this. I don't got this. -Coast Guard, Fitzgibbon. -Hello, sir. We're on Spooky Island. Our friends were... ...kidnapped. We need someone here right away. We do have a unit in the vicinity. Can you meet them at the pier? All right, they'll be right there. ""Our friends have been kidnapped."" -Something messed up is happening. -Is the Coast Guard here? What happened to the shattered windows and busted walls? Yo, Red. The ball. Let's go. Anyone else think this is strange? -Okay, we need to split up. -Why? -We need to find Fred and Velma. -I'll go this way. And we'll go with you. Come on, Scoob. Fred? Yo, the bitch was like, ""What?"" And I was like, ""Later on!"" What up, dog? And... -...dog. -Keeping it real. -What happened last night? -We got beats like it was the lizz-nizz. -You know what I'm saying, G? -No. You hear that? Get the dog. -Damsel in distress. -Let go of me. Help! Hurry, get the door! -Why is Fred in a bad mood? -He's not in a bad mood, Scoob... ...he's a monster. -Shaggy, bikes! -I know, ""yikes!"" No, bikes! Scoob! Shaggy, look out! I just saw my friend Beth Ann. Something's wrong with her eyes. Like, hop on! Like, what a drag! Like, duck! -Yes! -That was great! -Are you all right? You were great. -You too. -Scooby, what are you doing, man? -Mary Jane is a man in a mask. -Mary Jane is a man in a mask? -Scooby. What are you doing, man? Step off, Scoob. Shaggy, you're whipped. I'm whipped? Yeah? Why don't you say that to my face? Okay, I will. Your mommy eats cat poop! No, Scooby-Doo, your mom eats cat poop! Bring it. You want a piece of the Shagster? -Feel the pain, Scoob. -Okay. Come on! Two shots! Two shots! Me and you, me and you again. I'll give you some right now, buddy. Scoob! I gotta save him. You stay here, I'll be right back. No, Shaggy. I mean, it's too dangerous. I've got to. He's, like, my best pal. Friends don't quit. Scoob? Scooby-Doo... ...where are you? Scoob? Shaggy. Shaggy. Shaggy! Velma. I'll save you. Thanks, Shaggy. Boy, am I glad to see you. Let me go so I can return to my body. Get out of here... ...before they steal your protoplasm too. I always knew you were a hero, Shaggy. Jinkies! -Hey, buddy. -Shaggy! Someone must have spiked my root beer last night. Talk me down, man. Fred, you're a frigging protoplasmic head. I know. But I'm still the best-Iooking protoplasmic head here. How do you drive this? The Darkopalypse's upon us. Get what you need for the ceremony. On your right. Your left. I'm coming, good-Iooking! -Thank you, you've saved me. -Sorry, I'm looking for my friends. But... Put me back, Shaggy. I'll figure a way out myself. -Like, how? -I don't know. I'll use my tongue as an oar and swim to the edge. Sorry. Yo, yo, you, yo. What the...? You could use a little sunlight. That's one part of the mystery solved. The creatures need our bodies to survive in sunlight. Like a human suit. SPF 1,000,000. But what are they doing here in the first place? Daphne, you okay? Yeah. -But I'm not Daphne! -Fred? I couldn't get to my body. I didn't know where else to go. It's not easy to steer when you're pure spirit. I can look at myself naked. Oh, brother. -Get your hands off me. -Daphne? -He planned this somehow, didn't he? -Hey, good-Iooking. Fred, you egocentric... -Please tell me you guys are you. -Fred keeps touching me. Makes you nostalgic for the homicidal creatures. I stole this. I hope it helps. The Daemon Ritus. -I'm me again. -Yippee for you. Man, like, why am I wearing a dress? Everyone remain calm. Velma, what the heck's going on? If I am correct... ...due to the instability of protoplasm in the proximity of the Daemon Ritus... ...we're going to continue randomly changing bodies until... Jinkies! ...until the protoplasm realigns with the correct bodies. I'm Fred again! Daph, what's wrong with you? Don't you ever eat? I'm me. -I'm back. -Like, me too. Told you so. -Oh, no. -Let's go. I guess that was the wrong ingredient. Wait. I know how to handle this guy. Hey, you! What're you doing? Yes. That is masterful. I'm doing a voodoo ritual. I need to get the right ingredients. The only way to protect myself is by blessing this dead Arnouki beast. They're about to perform their evil Darkopalypse ritual. -Darkopalypse ritual? -Right. -That's what the ancient text describes. -Don't open that! They use the protoplasm in the vat as an energy source. And the leader needs to absorb a purely good soul to complete the ritual. Legend has it, once the ritual is performed... ...the creatures will rule on Earth for 10,000 years. That's why I have this in my house. To protect myself. You have another one of those? Those creatures are taking over the world? That is so mean. They can't do the ritual without a pure human soul. Where will they get one? I didn't say human. Oh, boy. Hello, puppy. If the person behind all this needs Scooby-Doo... Then that person is the one who brought Scooby here. Scoobert. How are you, my friend? Sit down, please. Okay. Scooby Snack? Maybe one. We'll need some more of those. That's me! It certainly is. And that's because...why? We love you, Scooby-Doo. Unlike that alleged friend of yours, Shaggy. He wouldn't believe you about that nasty girl Mary Jane, would he? No. But I believe you, my friend. And that's why I've got a very important job for you. What's that? That's a cat with a bobbing head. Please don't touch it. I would like you... ...to be a sacrifice. A sacrifice? If Mondorajagaga wanted Scooby, why'd he invite the rest of us? It doesn't matter. We gotta, like, go save Scoob. Our area of expertise is nut jobs in Halloween costumes. We're supposed to be heroes, man. So I'm gonna do what I always do: I'm gonna eat myself a Scooby Snack, and I'm gonna save my best pal. Velmster? You think I'm gonna fall for that? Giving me my own nickname? Trying to make me feel like... ...part of the gang? We could make a plan. What can I do? The only thing I'm good for is getting caught. But you never let that stop you before. And if that's not a true hero, then I don't know what is. Let's get jinkie with it. Okay, so we use the pulleys to tip over the vat. Daphne will open the air vents and release the disco skull. The light will refract off the skull... The creatures will explode, I'll find Scoob, and we'll have saved the world. Oh, no. The ritual's beginning. Quick. Attach this to the vat. We're here to save you. Shaggy, faster. All systems go. Wait, no! Mystery Inc. rides again. Quick, hide the Daemon Ritus. Would you like another Scooby Snack? Okay. Scooby-Doo! Yo, yo, yo. Yo, homedogs. You forgot the next part of the dance... ...where we do the Electric Slide, you know... Hurry up, Velma. Welcome to my little end-of-the-world party. I've waited a long time for this moment. Thank you for returning the ultimate party favor: The Daemon Ritus. And now, behold the sacrifice. Thank you. Thank you. Hello, thank you. Thank you. Shaggy? Let's run for it. We gotta get out of here. -I'm a sacrifice. Hello. -A sacrifice? Dude, that's not a good thing, Scoob. I'm sorry I yelled at you. And I'm sorry I haven't been a very good friend since we got here. -But you gotta trust me now. -You don't trust me. I do trust you. Now, look. Who's your best buddy? -Shaggy. -Right. And who's my best buddy? -Scooby-Doo? -That's right. You are. And we're like two trippy peas in a far-out pod, man. Best buddies trust each other. Let's do what we do best. Let's run out of here screaming in fear like two lunatics, okay? On the count of... Let's make it five. One. Two. Hey, look at me! The moment is at hand. Through the Daemon Ritus, I shall absorb the energy source. And now, to complete the transformation... ...I shall absorb the pure one. Ultimate power shall be mine! Nobody absorbs my pal! Come on! I'm free! Look at me! Get him! Let's get the Daemon Ritus. Get off my pincer! Cowabunga! Look, Velms. A man in a mask. We love you, Scooby-Doo. We love you. That alleged friend of yours, Shaggy. I shall absorb... Puppy power! I've outsmarted... Scrappy-Doo. Correction. The new, improved Scrappy. Because l, Scrappy-Dappy-Doo, have absorbed enough energy... ...to rule the world with my all-powerful army! And I've brought you here, puny, pathetic Mystery Inc... ...to witness my moment of triumph. All I need to complete my transformation is Scooby-Doo. Me? Don't you mean Melvin Doo? Seize them! Like, let's get out of here! Take that, pretty boy! This is totally un-groovy, Scoob. Scooby-Doo, where are you? Yield to my puppy power! -We gotta tip over the protoplasm vat. -How? The pincer. Come on. You all need to step back, because Fredster's got his groove on. Got you! You look so much bigger on TV. You're done! Come back here, you lazy beatnik. -Crud. -Told you so. Like, wow! Give me the dog! Down! Sit! Bad Scrappy! Let's finish this puppy! Now! Not again. Captured again, señorita? Not this time! -Now who's the damsel in distress? -Me? Straight up. Mystery Inc., this ain't over! Not by a long shot! I'll rock you and sock you... ...and crush you like... -Like, dude? -What? You're a bad puppy! Come on, I can still take you. Put them up, you mangy mutt. Is that all you got? -We did it! -Yes, we did. Cut it out. Mr. Mondevarious, is that you? Thank goodness! Thank you! Thank you! Velma! Thank you! You're fogging up my glasses. Two years ago, that little pest... ...turns up at a casting session for our evil elves. Next thing I know, I'm stuck in a hole... ...and he's cavorting about in a mechanical version of me. But look, thank you so much. What a delight. Fantastic! Fantastic! I love you, Shaggy. I love you too, Scoob. Now get off me, buddy. Thanks. You saved my life. Like, no problem. And thank you, Scooby-Doo. -My little schmookem-wookem. -Shucks. Fred, can you tell us how you solved the case? It all started when I was giving a speech on my new book and... And I think the Velmster should take it from here. Go. Through the combined intuitive powers of Mystery Inc... ...we've discovered the real villain is, in fact, Scrappy Cornelius Doo... ...who sadly was corrupted by the power of the Daemon Ritus. Get over it! So I got a little cranky. It's no reason to freak out like a jerk and try to kill all of humanity. I would've gotten away with it too, if not for you meddling sons of... Now that Mystery Inc. is back together... ...any comment on the Mud Bog Ghoul who's been terrorizing London? Whatever the case, Mystery Inc. will be there. Solving mysteries, man. -Righting wrongs. -Looking for clues and kicking butt. How groovy is this, man? Spooky Island finally came through with its all-you-can-eat deal. And there's nobody I'd rather gorge myself with than you, Scooby-Doo. -My best friend. -You're my best friend, buddy. You're beautiful like a beautiful piece of pizza. Zoinks! Them peppers is, like, hot. -Wimp. -Wimp? You think you can handle it? Why don't you put your mouth where your mouth is? Okay. Scooby-Doo, you feeling okay? Here you go, dude. -Like, how'd that taste, man? -Delicious. Well, let's get two more. On the count of three. One, two, three!"
6,2001,Double Take,American,"Daryl Chase (Jones) is a successful investment banker who handles international accounts for a major New York City firm. Chase discovers to his surprise that one of his biggest clients, a company from Mexico, is actually a front for a cartel of drug smugglers; he realizes too late that he's been framed for money laundering and the murder of two cops, and is now wanted by the FBI.
Chase is soon approached by a CIA agent, who thinks Chase's relationship with the Mexican drug kingpins might prove useful, but when his local contact disappears, Chase has to make his way to Mexico in order to save his skin and hopefully clear his name. Needing a new identity to get out of town and across the border, Chase obtains a stolen passport— and soon learns the man whose name he's using is in even deeper trouble with the law than himself.
With nowhere else to turn, Chase asks streetwise hustler Freddy Tiffany (Griffin) (in reality, an undercover FBI agent) to help him get out of town; Chase pretends to be Freddy, while Tiffany will pose as a businessman like Chase. However, Chase finds out Tiffany isn't the man he thought he was, and that his sticky situation is even more perilous and fraught with secrets than he imagined.",5.3,tt0238948,"Downloaded From www.AllSubs.org Where would I be without my baby The thought alone might break me And I don't wanna go crazy - But every thug needs a lady - Tired of being lonely Come on Don't you know that I love you - Hey-Hey, good morning, Mr. Chase. - Yes, it is.

They're with me. - You wanna tell me what's going on? - All secure. - You got 'em? - Mr. Chase and Miss Kent are now in our protection. Yeah. - Wrap it up. We'll do. Clean. Mr. Chase, we've been working a deep cover operation in Mexico. It involves drug trafficking... extortion and the murder of Governor Eduardo Quintana in Chihuahua. - Okay, that... What does that have to do with us? - Yeah. Have you ever heard of Don Carlos Cola? It's a dummy corporation that's a front for the Gutierrez drug cartel. They've been laundering money through this corporation for years. This morning they made a  106-million deposit to your bank. Daryl, what's going on? Have you ever seen these two men? No. Have you? - No. - That is your house guest from tonight. I gotta assume you're going somewhere with this. Those two guys are on the Gutierrez payroll. In fact, they've been hanging around the neighborhood for the last few days. Wait a minute. That's the guy that was on stage with me. Well, now, this asshole you ought to arrest. Anything you need, I'll testify. Yeah, that's Freddy Tiffany. He's an absolutely crazy man. - Stay away from him. - Wait a minute. - How long have you been following me? - Protecting you, Mr. Chase. There are people out there who want you dead. I'm not gonna let that happen. But for me to help you, you gotta trust me. Daryl. Look, I gotta get back to Mexico for a few days and wind this thing up.

How'd the wife get in here? - Hello? Is that you, Daryl? - Hello? McCready, is that you? Hell, yeah, it's me. I'm in trouble. They think I killed two cops. - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Yeah, sure. Hold on. My secretary, she is dead. Those two guys you showed me the pictures of, they showed up at my office this morning. - Look, I'm in trouble. - Excuse me. - Woman, woman, step off, all right? - But you're not using the phone. I got the phone now. You happy? Look, the shit just hit the fan here. Get your ass up here and get me out of this. Okay. First you gotta get out of New York. What are you talking about? Are you listening to me? I didn't kill anybody. I don't wanna leave New York. Stop it! - You wanna take your chances with NYPD? - Shit. Look, I'm black. I'm not stupid. Okay, get your black ass to Mexico where I can protect you. Meet me in the town of La Questa. La Questa. All right. Listen, Daryl, don't use your credit card, don't show your ID. If you do, they'll find you, they'll kill you. Just get to Mexico. Don't look at anybody. Don't wave at anybody. Don't talk to anybody. Yo, bitch, what up?

See, I know what your problem is. Your father fondled you as a child, didn't he? See, what you need is some couch time. Just sit down and let it all out. It happened to me... me and my grandfather. I remember I was three years old. - Hey, listen to me. I'm serious. - It was only when he was on that moonshine. Please. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Hey, hey, hey, baby. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, baby.

A fat woman wanna be skinny. A midget wanna be tall. - You wanna be white. - I'll take that as a yes. - Come on, man. - Hey, hey. Watch the clothes, man. - If you're gonna help me, help me. But just... - Oh, he need some help. Well, look here. If you don't wanna go to thepenitentiary, you might wanna listen to your new partner. Okay. Everybody, meet my new partner. My new partner. Top of the day. How's it going? How you doin' there, sir? I'll be over there in a couple of hours. Don't worry about it. We got it all under control. Hey, hey, smile, man. You look suspicious. That's what I'm talkin' about there too. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Loosen up the walk, too, man. You know what I mean? Put a little pep in the step. That's right. That's right. Take it back to the hood. It's all good in the hood. It's all good. How's it going there, sir? I want you to check the numbers on the ticker tape and I'll get back to you at 7:00. All right? Look, bro, just act black. That's all you gotta do. Say, blood. - What it is, jive turkey. - Hey, hey, hey, bro... All right, mama. What's the last movie you seen, man? Car Wash? Man, you can kiss my ass. Car Wash was a good movie. Final boarding call for the Empire Builder... with service to Newark... Hey, Mr. Chase! In the blue suit! - Mr. Chase! - Hey, hey, hey! What is your problem? Get your hands off of me, mister! - All right, I'm sorry. We made a mistake. - Of course you made a mistake. And I demand an apology from the both of you. What is this all about? A white man in a suit with a black man in a suit... African-American male, 6'1 ""to 6'3"", wearing a blue suit. - Why you puttin' your hands on me? - Did you say blue suit? Copy that. You'll love it. - How rude. - I'm talking to you! - Whoa! Whoa! Would you just get on the train? - Just get on the train. - Some kind of Feds, huh? - We gotta go. - I know my rights! What do you want? There's not gonna be any Rodney Kings going on. - Hey! Oh, I'm doing good. - Hey, how are you, sir? - You got your ticket? - Yes, yes, yes. How you doin', sisters? This is their first time on a train. I'm trying to tell them how much fun they're gonna have. Oh. There's a first time for everything. You must not do that, young man. Look, we're not trying to give you a hard time, Mr. Allsworth. But imagine how we feel when two of our fellow officers turn up dead. Well, why don't I ask the commissioner about it tomorrow when he comes to my house for cocktails? Yes, he is a friend of mine. And so is Daryl Chase. A very good friend. I brought him into this firm. He is the best and the brightest. I refuse to believe that he has anything to do with this. Okay, good. Now we're all very clear on what you refuse to believe. So why don't I tell you what we do believe? We believe you're full of shit. And we believe Daryl Chase is up to no good. Now, we followed him all the way to Penn Station. - Where do you think he was going? - Vacation, maybe. Vaca... Did he... Did he maybe have a little vacation time stored up, Mr. Allsworth? - What's your point? - My point is that we've notified the authorities everywhere... Mexico, Canada, Oz. Wherever he goes, they're gonna catch him. But just in case there's a slight possibility that he contacts you first, do me one little favor. Pick up the phone, give us a call, okay? - Good day, Mr. Allsworth. - Goodbye, Mr. Allsworth. - You know, I actually believed you were NYPD. - You did a very good job too. You know, most people who wear these are actually missing a tooth. - I just liked the way it looked. - You would. It look good on you, though, bro. It look good. Hi. Just the man I'm looking for. I need two phone lines put in this room if I can. I need an Internet access on one, fax on the other, paper at every stop... New York Times... He needs a fax. He needs a fax. I got all your money. Look at that, girl. Smell it. That's right. Can buy a whole lot of dog food with that. Whole lot of dog... You're a little cutie pie, you know that? - Those things are not included in the price of a ticket. - All I need... is two phone lines in this room: One with Internet access... - You're being rude, just like you were today to those two nuns. - One with a fax. - Making new friends, are we? - Good morning, sir. How are you? Having a nice trip? I'm having an excellent time. Look. Whatever my friend needs here, you put that on my tab. You got it, sir. Whatever you say, you got it. What a gentleman. You gotta love him. You were rude. Racist asshole. Ah, you're gettin' a taste of your own medicine. Now you're startin' to find out it wasn't the brother in the suit... but it was the suit that was on the brother... that got you your so-called respect. Nice watch, ain't it? Yeah, uh, it's... it's real classy. Look, uh, Freddy, I appreciate everything you did helping me get on this train. And I ain't gonna forget it. But when we get to the next stop, we go our own separate ways. - Your services are no longer required. - Oh. Oh, well, ain't that a bitch. It's just like you rich people. When you get done using us downtrodden... hood recipients... you wanna kick us to the curb. Throw us to the wolves like some naked sheep. What the hell do naked sheep got to do with ghetto recipients, Freddy? - What the hell are you talking about? - I give you this much. You know, you probably went to some kind of accredited school, college and whatnot. - Yeah, I went to Harvard. So what? - Well, you know, I went to H.K. U... Hard Knock University. And that's what you gonna need to get out of this. They ain't gonna take no book smarts. Street smarts. - I don't need you, Freddy. - You saying you smarter than me? - I'm saying I'm smarter than you. - You smarter than me? - I'm smarter than you. - Your neurons are firing quicker than mine are. I got your Bulgari ring, your watch... your Italian suit that caresses me, oh, so well... and a phat wad of cash... that you said was two Gs... ah, in what used to be your inner pocket. And I got all of that in less than ten seconds, girl. Did you hear her? Say it again, baby. Ten seconds. But you smarter than me. Come on. Let's burn some ants. We're gonna burn some bugs with these here. What are you doing here? Well, according to the two D cups on your watch, it's dinnertime. You got dinnertime money? I'm just jokin'. I'm just jokin'. - You know, your credit's good with me. - Excuse me, sir. Here's the paper you wanted. That's for him. - Thanks, Guido. - It's Vito. - Whatever. - Thank you, sir. - Anytime now. - Why don't you just bury your head in his ass? - Let's see. One dinner... - You gentlemen ready to order? - Ah, yes, yes. I'm going to have... Let's see here. The prime rib, medium rare. And bring me some Grand Marnier over the rocks. That's the way we used to have it when I was in Harvard. Chauncey made the best ones. I'm gonna have the yard bird burnt to a crisp. Now, I need you to spit on that with a little bit of hot Tabasco. And I'm gonna wash all that down with a dog of Schlitz malt liquor. I'm sorry, sir. I don't believe we have Schlitz malt liquor. No Schlitz malt liquor? No Schlitz malt liquor? Well, ain't that some shit. How you gonna run a successful business... and you ain't got no Schlitz malt liquor? You ain't keepin' it real. You ain't representin'. What you doin' up in here, boy? Uh, uh, uh, shit. - I'll see what I can do, sir. - Ya do that. Fresh-Prince-of-Bel-Air-looking mo... He do look like the father on the Fresh Prince. Hey, uh, look, bro. We ain't gettin' nowhere by fightin'. Why don't you just talk to me? I mean, how bad can it be? It ain't like you murdered anybody. Man, what kind of shit are you into? Freddy, do you remember my assistant, Shari? You met her at the office. The one with that phat ass? Yes. Well, she's dead. I'm sorry, man. My bad. I'm sorry to hear that. L- I went to her apartment and, uh... I don't know what happened, man. These two cops wound up dead, and they think I did everything. What's up with the CIA, bitch? - Ah, here you go, gentlemen. - Uh, thank you. You're a scholar and a gentleman. Compliments to the chef. How do you know about the CIA, Freddy? I, um... I can't really talk to you about this. Is that why we're on our way to Mexico? I happen to know Mexico like the back of my hand. I am internationally known. I done mischief everywhere. Puerto Rico, Colombia, Brazil... all them Mexican countries. - That I believe.- Well, since you're starting to believe me... we been watched for the last three states. - Yeah, I'm sure. - I'm serious as a heart attack. By Curly from the Globetrotters over your right shoulder. Don't look. It'd call attention to yourself. See, you need me more than you think. '45 was a good year, sir. Yeah. Appreciate that. - Man, I gotta run. - Run where? To the bathroom. Man, that prime rib is running through me. Well, I hope you can hold it. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Oh, come on, man. Damn! You heard me say I gotta go, man. Excuse me, uh, sir. - Could you help me with this door here? - Sure. Appreciate it. Let's see what you got on you. I know you ain't got no condoms. Too ugly. - We got your monkey ass.- Lookie here. A ugly picture of you. You know this dude? - Hell, no. - Well, he seems to know you. Shit! Who is this, Freddy? I have no idea. - That was a good plan, man. Thanks. - Oh, anytime. Whoa, whoa, whoa. He had a gun? ""Had"" is the key word in that sentence. - Hey, Freddy. - Yeah? Freddy, there's a body out here. What you want me to do? Walk away from it before people think you had something to do with it. I'm using the bathroom! - Man, you really hit me, man. - Man, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna check your hinges. - Shut up, man, before you get us busted. - I done met you down here like you told me to. - Dribble, Curly, dribble. Go to your lanes. - You bust me in the head. - Hey, how's it going this evening? - Fine. - Can I bother you for a paper? - Go right ahead. Let's see what we got here. Uh, look, these papers... never made it on the train. Sir, I ain't got change for a hundred. - They ain't never made it on the train. - They're gone. All aboard... the night train! No problem. I'll take care of it. Hope you're having a nice trip, sir. - Wonderful. Put that on my bill. - Shit. Well, well, well, look who made the paper. Page three. ""Wall Street Banker Wanted for Questioning in Multiple Homicide. "" No, no, no, keep reading. There's a  100,000 reward... for your whereabouts and or capture. - Are you gonna turn me in, Freddy? - You know, the thought had crossed my mind. No, bro. Just relax. - You wanna take a seat? - No, I'm okay. - You mind if I cop a squat? - Not at all. All right. Join me, man. Go on. Take a load off. Look, Daryl. I believe you're innocent. I had to be sure. You know, I treat each case with a certain amount of trepidation. Uh, I'm really not Freddy Tiffany. My real name is Fred Tiffany. I had you fooled with all that street shit, huh? Yeah. Mr. Chase, I'm with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I'm protecting you on the way to Mexico. And once we get there, we're gonna flush out the real criminals. Man, you got everybody after you. You got the CIA, the FBI... NBC, UPN, you pick a nigga, as-salaam alaikum. - What happened to him? - Oh, he's just drunk, man. I'm just trying to wake him up, you know. Ya all right, baby? Ya all right, brother? Get your ass off this train. - What the hell! What the hell are you doing? - Shut up! Help! What are you doing?

You better alert the governor that Freddy Tiffany is in the house. - Freddy Tiffany? - Oh, no, no, no, no. That's internationally known Freddy Tiffany, fool. We'll alert the governor that Mr. Internationally Known has arrived. - Internationally known. - Just un segundito. Handcuff his ho when a nigga like me step up in the place. Tell you right now. Ain't that right, Delores? In, bitch. I'm gettin' tired of you. Tell you that right now. Put on a little music. Goddam. Arriba, arriba, Speedy Gonzalez. Let's go! Oooh, shit! You wanna live, get in the car. You wanna die, get in the car. I know how to duck us into Mexico. Think! Just think, Daryl! How is it I'm outside your apartment? How do I know where your office is, Daryl? How am I at the bottom of the escalators at Penn Station? Huh? I'm the FBI. Federal Bureau of Investigation. And the name is Fred Tiffany, by the way! Most highly decorated agent at the whole Bureau! But you wanna believe a drug dealer, McCready. If I wasn't a Christian... Delores, sit still, bitch. Hey. Hey, that's one of those old-school hip-hop beats. That's like some Run D.M.C. That's more like Grandmaster Flash. No, no, no. That's definitely Run D.M.C. Man, listen to the grooves. Come on. What you know about hip-hop? - You got that. You got that. - Huh? This is ""mus-ack. "" Man, it's kind of phat, though. - I like the little mariachi horns, man. - Yeah, that's tight.

You might be from the projects. - Ah, son! - That had to hurt. - All right. - Here. Limp your way back over here. - Let me show you how it's done. - Please take the stage. Tag, I'm it. Let me show you how I used to do it... before I joined the Bureau. See, we used to take it up like that there, nice and easy. Then we... huh, huh, huh... bring it around like that. - Ohhh. - Then we'd... huh... bring it. Drop it like it's hot. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick... tick, tick, tick.

Good luck with that. - Can I get a key? - Key. Thank you. Take it easy. Tiffany? Tiffany. Damn, if I were him, I'd have shot the son of a bitch that took that picture. Have you bumped your head? Hey, little darlin'. Our ship has just come in. - Uh, yeah? - Hey, McCready, this is Daryl. - Daryl Chase.- Mr. Chase, where in the hell are you? I'm at an emu ranch in, um... - Shit. Where am I? ""Rancito. "" - You mean, Texas? Yes, Texas. I was trying to get into Mexico tosee you. I almost got killed at the border. They thought I was Freddy Tiffany. By the way, this guy keeps showing up everywhere. - How the hell does he keep finding me? - I told you to stay away from Tiffany. I'm trying to stay away from Tiffany. I just told you he keeps showing up everywhere I go. Plus, he claims you're at the centre of some drug trafficking scheme. Of course I'm at the centre of it. I'm with the CIA. Right now I'm watching a bunch of drug smugglers load up a plane full of cocaine. They think I'm their friend. That's what I do. I watch the bad guys. Stop listening to a murderer. Listen, your murderer thinks he's with the FBI. - He was kicked out of the Bureau two years ago. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - He really was with the FBI? - He's out on a 5150. A mental. You are with a class-A psychopath. Mr. Chase, stay put. We're coming to rescue you and take Mr. Tiffany into custody. - Don't move. - I don't believe this. Fine. Hey, McCready. McCready? - Hello? Daryl. - Chloe? - Daryl, Jesus! Where the hell are you? - I don't have time to explain that right now. You all right? - Miss Kent, remember what I said. - No. I got a million cops asking me questions, Daryl. I don't know if you're alive. I don't know if you're dead. I don't know what's happening to our lives. - Okay, partner, we're in business. - You guys wanted lunch? - Whoa, ho, ho. We almost got this. - I got the prefix. Look. Does the word Pentium mean anything to either one of you? Will you get this away from the equipment, please? Take it away from the equipment. - Is Martinez still there with you? - Yeah. - Don't stay on the phone too long. - Chloe, I know all this doesn't make sense to you right now. - But I promise you, it's all gonna be fine. - Stay on the line. - Stay on the line. Don't hang up. - Daryl, I'm scared. - You better hang up the phone. - Quiet, quiet, quiet! Okay, I got the fourth digit. I promise, it's all gonna work out fine. - Stay on the line. Stay on the line. - You better hang up. - Stay on the line. - Baby, I love you. - Five digits! - I love you too. - Hang it up. - Six digits. - Now. - One more thing. Hang up the damn phone! You know, you like a piece of faeces with peanuts... a pain in my ass. - I see you brought your little white girlfriend with you. - Shut up! Probably been on the phone with McCready, huh? Probably told you I was on a 5150. Mm-mmm. It's a 1718. I don't even know what that is. You know what that is? What is it? - A button? - No. It's a transmitter. - What is it? What is it? - A pager. No. This is a tracking device. That's how I knew where you were every time you made a move! Why do you think I had us change clothes at Penn Station... under the auspices of being a criminal, mister? And the dog... Oh, the dog is the centre of this entire investigation. Oh, yeah. You didn't know that, did you? - No. I was under the auspices that it was a tracking device. - Shut up. Get up. You coming with me. Get up! Ooh, ooh, I'm sorry. You may want to hold on to that tracking device. That's all right. I can throw a bullet at you. Don't you go nowhere. You wait right there. Baby, you keep guard, all right? Hey, wait a minute, fool! Come here! Hold on, mister! I threw a ring down the toilet 'Cause that's where our love went All right. Let me guess. Somebody tried to kill you. T.J. McCready miraculously shows up and shoots him. - Yep. That's it. - That's the oldest trick in the book, man. At the Bureau, we call it the double take. If you'd have looked twice, you'd have seen what really happened. - So that didn't really happen? - Nah. It's all smoke and mirrors. See, Thomas Chela is Minty Gutierrez. They're one in the same. The Gutierrez drug cartel ring a bell? He's the guy with the glass eye... floatin' all over his shit, kind of got that Sammy Davis thing happening, man. Hey, wait a minute. You mean Don Carlos Cola is a drug front? Exactly. Governor Quintana was working with the United States Government. I get the drop that somebody's tryin' to assassinate him... get there a couple of minutes late, get caught on camera inside his house. Thus the dilemma I find myself in at this particular junction. - Man, you didn't even do this then. - Hell, no. I didn't murder nobody, unfortunately. Governor Quintana, he was trying to slow the drug flow into the United States. I mean, how good is that for the kids? - That's some serious shit, Freddy. - Yeah. No shit. - You're being framed. - Exactly. By the same people that are trying to frame you. - You FBI. You can go talk to them. They can clear me. They can clear you.- No, no, no, no. This is my point exactly. The FBI has no jurisdiction in Mexico. I'm not even supposed to be playin' right now. This is some rogue shit. - You lookin' at a rogue. - Fred, I had... I had no idea. - You a rogue. - A rogue. - Rogue. - Don't patronize me, man. I'm sorry. My bad. You just a big rogue. I won't p-patronize you, you big rogue. - All right. See you later, rogue. - Man, you might want to listen... to some of this shit if you want to live past tomorrow. - You ain't goin' nowhere without me. - With an IQ of a tree Honey, that ain't all You've seen the last of me Yeah! I'm sorry, man. Really. I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've been... I've been rude. - He fits the description. - I'm gonna call it in. Shit on a stick! What the hell? Shit. Get this gun out of my ass! You've got to admit, that ""rogue"" shit was pretty... Aw, shit! - Your dumb dog bit me! - That's what you get. - Damn! You got sheriff crackers out there thinkin' that you're me. - What? Damn it, Molly Jo! Mike, how'd you get out of the pen? You shit in that pool, and you're gonna end up lunch meat. Shit! It's the Pepsi truck! Shit! Shit! Shit! Mother's Cookies! Mother's damn Cookies! Fiji Water. Damn Fiji Water. Freddy, when McCready gets here, this is all over. Will you calm down? Those are McCready's men out there. Don't you get it? - What are you doin'? - Calling a strike team. Find the right goddam pen, have a strike team here in seconds. Coming soon: The Black Rogue. Joe, Steven, get those trucks out of here. Luther, come with me. ""Dear Strike Team. It's me, Freddy. Send help soon. Signed, Rogue. "" - Move it out! - You ain't gonna think everything's so damn funny in just about a minute. Gunfire! Hey! Gunfire! Come on, Tiffany! I am not Freddy Tiffany! I am not Freddy Tiffany! I fall to pieces We got a border to cross! - I'm Freddy Tiffany! I'm Freddy Tiffany! - Hell, yes, you are! Get me out of here! I fall to pieces Oh, shit! How can I be just your friend - What the... - You want me to act - Like we've never kissed - Let's go, bitch. You want me to forget Pretend we've never met - You'd better be worth a lot of damn money; that's all I can say. - You mother... And I try and I try but I haven't yet You walk by and I fall to pieces You walk by And I fall to pieces We made it, baby! Hey, man, what's goin' on? Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's my meal ticket, there! I'm sorry about this mess, but I know you know where them big-booty bitches... Get off of me! Don't tell me to shut up! - You don't know who I am. - Put him back in here with Daddy. Now, listen, Mr. Funny Man. Enjoy your visit, huh? Okay. I'm going. Kiss my ass, Paco! Come in, Mr. Tiffany! Come in! Step into my office. Sit down. Have a cigar, Mr. Tiffany. Here. Here. Go on. Go on. Have a cigar. Here. Very good. Go ahead. Go ahead. Huh? You have no idea what it means to meet you, Mr. Tiffany. This is a great moment. I take it you and Governor Quintana weren't exactly friendly. Oh, I loved Governor Quintana! He was a great man who was trying to make a difference. Oh, that is, of course, why he bought the farm, as you Americanos say. But he will always be held in the warmest place of my heart. Let me ask you something, Capitán. What? Wh-What is that? You all smiling at me like I'm Regis and I got a million dollars. - Very funny. - What's up with that? That is because there will be promotions for all of us. You know... the men who captured you. Well, before you boys break out the pinatas and start drinkin' tequila... - I'd like to make my phone call. - Huh? My phone call. To T.J. McCready with the CIA. I think he'll explain who I really am. A phone call? You want to make a phone call? He wants to make a phone call! This is not America, my friend. You do not get a phone call. Next, you will be wanting us to call Johnnie Cochran, huh? Wh-What is this? - I'm not Freddy Tiffany. - What? I'm Daryl Chase. Looks like Foghorn Leghorn over here screwed up. I say... I say, ain't that right, boy? What is the meaning of all of this? Now, hold on. Just wait a second here. Let me think. You realize I can bring you up on charges for trying to trick me? - Now, wait a goddam minute. - Huh? - I am tellin' you, he... - Boss, boss. - What? - Really? Well, we shall see. There is somebody here to see you. - Me? - Mm-hmm. - Who? - Your senorita. Federico. - Wait. I know you, right? - You know me? You know me? Well, I should hope so that you know me. Look, I don't know what's with the accent, but we met at the La Perla party. No, we did not meet at La Perla. We met at the other place. - You know what I'm talking about. - I'm Daryl Chase. - You are not Daryl Chase! You are Federico! - No, no. No, see, I'm Dar... We met at the La Perla party. Remember? - I don't know her. - Well, you... you just said you did. Okay. We met at a party... I met her, but I don't, you know, know her, you know, in the biblical, like she... You know me! You know me mucho times, okay? - Mucho times. - I don't know this girl. - Why? Why are you doing this to her? - Look. I don't know... what greasy, grubby nigga she been laying up in the bed with. - I ain't got nothin' to do with this. - That is not a very nice thing to say. I'm not lyin'! I do not know her! Captain... I never talked to this ""macarena"" girl! I love you, Freddy! This a bad time to talk about that reward? Don't worry about a thing, girl. 'Cause when we get to Mexico, I'm a Mexican and you a chihuahua. So you gotta learn how to habla Espanol when we get there, you know. Hey, girl. Look at this: An invasion of Texas. Hey, y'all have a good time in America! And my name is Paco if anybody asks. Bark in Spanish. Well, that was good, girl. Sure you ain't got no chihuahua in you? I mean, how hard can this be? On our way to Mexico. Oh, hell, yeah. We cruisin', baby. Look at that. Yeah, this is good. Oh, shh... Shit! Delores! Delores! I see you, baby! Here I come! Hang in there, girl. Ah. Ah, I told you Daddy'd be here. Ai-yai-yai. It's my baby. Thank you. Thank you. - 'Preciate it. 'Preciate it. - No, no, no, no. No, no, no. Black man going to Mexico. Y'all can go to Compton. I'm going to Mexico! Look. Over that way! No! U.S.A. Me and the dog can take all y'all. Bring it on! Bring it on! Watch it, baby. Bite 'em! Keep missin' with me. All of ya. No. Look out. - Here you go, Mr. Allsworth. - Hmm? Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - This is a good thing you're doing, Chloe. The CIA won't let anything happen to him. You're doin' the right thing by helpin' us out. I'll do whatever it takes. I ain't gettin' out! Yeah, drop me off right here! Thanks for the ride, suckers! Shit. Hello, Mr. Chase. I trust you had a pleasant trip. - You have no idea. - I've come to get you out of here. Let's go. Thanks, man. Shit. Daryl, wait up. I need to step over here and take care of some paperwork... and get your things, and then you can tell me about everything. The sooner I get out of here, the better. - What happened to your leg? - A dog bit me. Oh. Here you go, amigo. Freddy Tiffany. Let me guess. Somebody tried to kill you. T.J. McCready miraculously shows up in the nick of time... and shoots him. Shit. And the dog? Oh, the dog is the centre of this entire investigation. Shit. Shit. Shit. Hey, Martinez. Daryl, you want to step over here and sign out? Daryl? - Where is he? Where did he go? - Who? Chase. He made me. He's on the move. - We didn't see him. - He's on foot. He's running. Let's go. What in the shit were y'all doin'? Let's move it. We gotta find him. We gotta find him. We gotta find him. Oh! Sorry. Don't move! Now, you heard me. Don't move. - Freddy? - Yeah, it's me. Hey, hey, hey. It's gonna be all right. All right? I'll get you through this. - I thought you was crazy. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, look. - We gotta get the hell out of here. - No, no. I gotta get to New York. McCready's dirty like you said. Martinez left Chloe. - I don't know if she's dead. - Look, look, look. She's gonna be fine. Chloe's going to be fine. Remember my partners Norville and Gradney? Partners? Wait, wait, wait. The drug dealers? They're FBI agents. They've been down with me the whole time. It's a covert operation. Let's get the hell out of here before we end up with bullets in our head. Oh, shit! Down, bitch! - Do I look like I'm goddam moving? - I'm talking to the goddam dog! - Who is that? - Oh, you're gonna like this. Oh, yeah? What am I gonna like about this? The new guy, bought and paid for. Send him up, Minty. Send him up. I can't begin to tell you how you guys have screwed things up for me. You are a bunch of stupid, incompetent jackasses... who don't know how to do a simple job. And you... If you are any indication of the efficiency... of the Central Intelligence Agency, let me tell you, my friend: Your government is in deep water. Minty, in every operation there are a couple of snags. You go off like a loose cannon, kill Governor Quintana... get bit by his dog and have the stupidity to leave it behind... connecting you to the crimes and me as well. And you call that ""snags""? And you... You assured me that my money was safe... safe from prying eyes. Well, Minty, it was, until you transferred  million... into your account in a single day. Daryl would've had to be dead not to catch it. See, Minty? A snag. Minty, I will handle your accounts personally if things get any worse. And exactly how much worse are they supposed to get? - I can handle Daryl. - That time is all passed now. I am going to take care of Daryl myself, my way. Oh, hey, I don't like the sound of that. - That is music to my ears. - Gentlemen. - Hi, baby. - Come here. - What happened to you? - Stinkin' mutt bit me. Damn thing's bitin' everybody, right? Yeah. That little furball has got sharp teeth. Minty, I'd like for you to meet Agent Gradney, FBI. Let me guess, huh? You... You want a piece of the action, hmm? - I'm worth it. - Yeah? Show me how you're worth it. Well, why don't we ask Maque here. - Isn't that right, sweet thing? - Hey. Wh-Wh-What do you think that you're doing, huh? She's Tiffany's partner. Always has been. She was a plant from the beginning. Now, that bite mark's the only thing that connects you to this murder. We make sweet thing disappear here, along with that stinkin' mutt... FBI doesn't have much of a case, now, do they? Whoa. You are better than I thought. Damn! Elliot was a good man... and there wasn't too many good men at the Bureau. They put me on a because I give a damn. I'm sorry about your friend, man. There's somebody special in there I want to get out. It's payback time. - No wonder the Bureau kicked him out. - Hey, hey, hey. Watch it. Slow! I am Freddy Tiffany, FBI! - Oh, look at that fool. - Lookie here. Lookie here. Keep your hands off me! You know damn well you got orders not to shoot. You know what's goin' down? I'm going to arrest all you crackers. - You can believe that and then some. - Hey, Tiffany. - What? - I think you forgot about me. - No, I didn't. - Freeze! Freeze. You, I'm just going to kill. Martinez, drop your gun. Drop it. - You all right, baby? - I'm better now. Get your ass over there. You, Jones! Get your bitch ass over there! - Daryl, handle your business. - Here, sweetie. Thank you, baby. You know how I like silver guns. T.J., where is Chloe? Banker boy, how do you plan on gettin' out of here? Your life is worth less than a Mexican food stamp right now. I'm going to ask you again. Where is Chloe? Eh, Mr. Chase, Chloe is in perfect health. If you don't believe me, take a look out that window. See for yourself. - Please. - Thomas... if I don't like what I see, you're all dead men. - Daryl, this is not like you. - I think the brother means business. Put your hands where I can see 'em! - Hey, baby! - Well, what did you expect, huh? Your girlfriend in chains and shackled in a deep, dark wine cellar, huh? We are all civilized here, Mr. Chase. - What about Governor Quintana? - Unfortunately... Quintana didn't want to be part of our happy little family. That's why I'm sure you both will be more cooperative than he was. More cooperative? C.A., you piece of shit. You were like a father to me. Well, you're still like a son to me, Daryl. That's why all of this can be resolved very simply and cleanly. - C.A., shut up. - Hey, uh, Minty. I got a question. How is it you can afford the CIA, a banker from Wall Street... but you can't seem to buy a better eye... than that marble you got rollin' around in your skull? - Oh, you got some balls, Tiffany. - That's what your mama said. Okay, Minty. Enough of this cops-and-robbers bullshit. - Call in the guns. - I'm afraid I can't do that. - I beg your pardon? - I have always known... that Maque Sanchez was with the FBI. God, Charles, I have got well over 600 million... in your American banks right now, which your government has frozen. The only chance I have of ever recovering any of my money... is to turn all of you over to the Justice Department... which Mr. Tiffany and Miss Sanchez happen to be members of. My God. You set me up. That's why you made that goddam deposit. - You started all of this. - Ah, that's right. And you clowns just confessed to everything we need. Considering the caliber of your work... you are all lucky to be able to walk out of here with your lives. Betrayal. Ain't it a bitch? - Drop the gun, or I'll kill her. - Put it down. - I swear I'll kill her. - Drop the gun, Tiffany. - Put the gun down now. - Tiffany, you son of a bitch, I'll kill her! - Put it down! - Will you stop it, Freddy? - Drop the gun. - Put it down! - Shut up! - Put it down now! - Goddam it, Freddy! - Put your gun down! - I'll kill her! - You want to go there with me? - Relax! - I'll kill her! - Let's go there! - Freddy! - Me and you! - Shut up! - Shoot him! - Huh? What? - Shut up! - Freddy! - I'll roll you like a Philly blunt and smoke your bitch ass! They shot Minty! Cover me, baby. Cover me! Clear! Come on! - Martinez? - What? - You play golf, right? - What? I know your families used to run around with leaf blowers cuttin' lawns. - But you play golf, right? - No, man. Why don't you come out here and show me? Well, here's a little lesson from Tiger. Fore! Yeah, he's dead. Just about out of here. You really are from the projects. You didn't hit a damn thing. Now, let me show you how a shooter never, ever misses. Oh, no! Oh! Oh! He wasn't lying. He didn't miss once. Looks like it's the last one. They're going to hang a sign over your cell: ""Over one billion served. "" - You never know, do you? - Hello, Daryl. Chloe. Shari? Sorry, Daryl. We had to get you out of New York. It was our only way to flush out T.J. McCready... and connect him with Charles Allsworth and Gutierrez. - So they're... they're with... - They're all with me. Just one big, happy FBI family. I trusted you, and you... you used me. We did what we had to to save your life. Daryl, baby, it's over, all right? And we're safe. - Can I hug an FBI agent? - No. But you can hug a friend. That'll work. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Take care of yourself. - No doubt. You still got a phat ass. Freddy, I can't believe you're from Malibu. Malibu High. Class of'84. - Oh, he's so cute. - Thank you. Then I went to Hawaii. I was on the pro surf circuit for about three years. Hey, hey, hey. Your brother came in first. Brother from Malibu. Chloe, look at this. - Oh, what's so funny? - Nothin'. - I know you're not laughin' at my man. - Have you seen this? Yes, I have. I think he looks cute. Thank you. Okay, baby. Okay. It's all right. Hey, uh... uh, Daryl, you didn't touch that, did you? Oh, this? Yeah, I know. It can scramble a strike team in less than seconds. I don't want nobody else but you Oh, see? See what I'm talkin' about? I don't want nobody else but you Go in! Go in! Go in! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Don't care if the bank was free Hey, fellas!

7,2000,High Fidelity,American,"Rob Gordon is a self-confessed music loving everyman with a poor understanding of women. He is dumped by his latest girlfriend, Laura, and attempts to understand what is the failure in his relationships by seeking out old partners.
By day, he holds court at his record store, Championship Vinyl, where customers drift through. His helping hands, especially with musical elitism, are Dick and Barry, the ""musical moron twins"". Armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of all things musical, they compile ""top five"" lists for every conceivable occasion, openly mock the tastes of their customers and sell a few records.
Two shoplifting skateboarder teenagers, Vince and Justin are bothers to them until Rob listens to a recording that they made as The Kinky Wizards. He offers them a record deal to start off his own label called Top 5 Records. During his off hours, he pines for Laura and does his best to win her back.
Rob soon hears that Laura's father, who liked Rob, has died, and attends his funeral with her. Shortly after the reception, Rob realizes he has always had one foot out-of-the-door and never committed to her. He realizes by doing so he has neglected his own future. They resume cohabitation. He meets a music columnist and a crush develops, but then he wonders while making a mixtape for her, if he will always just be jumping from rock to rock.
He explains to her how other girls are just fantasies, Laura is a reality, and he never tires of her. He proposes marriage; she thanks him for asking. She organizes for him to revisit a love of his youth: dee-jaying. It is also a celebration of the recently released single by the two delinquents, where Barry's band plays ""Let's Get It On"". Surprised that Barry's band is not a disaster, Rob holds Laura, and they both sway to the music. Rob makes a mixtape for Laura, feeling that he has finally learned how to make her happy.",7.4,tt0146882,"What came first, the music or the misery? People worry about kids playing with guns, or watching violent videos... that some sort of culture of violence will take them over. Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands-- literally, thousands of songs about heartbreak, rejection... pain, misery and loss. Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable... or was I miserable because I listened to pop music? Youre gonna wake up wonderin Find your self on the floor You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever. No. We've done the hard part now. I might as well-- Why don't you stay for tonight then? Laura. You're just gonna-- My desert island, all-time top five most memorable breakups... in chronological order... are as follows: Alison Ashmore, Penny Hardwick... Jackie Alden, Charlie Nicholson and Sarah Kendrew. Those were the ones that really hurt. Can you see your name on that list, Laura? Maybe you'd sneak into the top ten. But there's just no room for you in the top five. Sorry! Those places are reserved for the kind of humiliation and heartbreak... you're just not capable of delivering. If you really wanted to mess me up, you should've gotten to me earlier! Which brings us to number one on the top five, all-time breakup list... Alison Ashmore. One moment they weren't there. Not in any form that interested us, anyway. And then the next, you couldn't miss them. They were everywhere, and they'd grown breasts. And we wanted-- Actually, we didn't even know what we wanted. But it was something interesting. Disturbing, even. My relationship with Alison Ashmore lasted for six hours: the two hours after school, before ""The Rockford Files"" for three days in a row. But on the fourth afternoon-- Kevin Bannister. Slut. It would be nice to think that since I was 14, times have changed... relationships have become more sophisticated... females less cruel... skins thicker, instincts more developed. But there seems to be an element of that afternoon in everything that's happened to me since. All my romantic stories are a scrambled version of that first one. Number two on the top five, all-time breakup list was Penny Hardwick. Penny was great-looking... and her top-five recording artists were Carly Simon, Carole King... James Taylor, Cat Stevens and Elton John. Erin! No, come here! She was nice. Nice manners, nice grades, nice looking. She was so nice, in fact, that she wouldn't let me put my hand... underneath or even on top of her bra. Attack and defense. Invasion and repulsion. It was as if breasts were little pieces of property that had unlawfully annexed by the opposite sex. They were rightfully ours, and we wanted them back. Sometimes I got so bored of trying to touch her breasts that I would try to touch her between her legs. I was like trying to borrow a dollar, getting turned down and asking for grand instead. I wasn't interested in Pennys nice qualities, just breasts... and therefore she was no good to me. What's the point? It never goes anywhere. Rob? I started dating a girl who everyone said would give it up and who didn't... and Penny went with this asshole named Chris Thompson who told me that he had sex with her... after something like three dates. I own this store called Championship Vinyl. It's located in a neighborhood that attracts the bare minimum of window shoppers. I get by because the people make a special effort to shop here. Mostly young men... who spend all their time looking for deleted Smiths singles... and original-- not re-released, underlined-- Frank Zappa albums. Fetish properties are not unlike porn. I'd feel guilty taking their money if I wasn't... well, kinda one of em. - Morning, Dick. - Oh. Hi. Hi, Rob. - Have a good weekend? - Yeah, okay. Um, I found the first ""Liquorice Comfits"" album over at Vintage Vinyl... the one on Testament of Youth. Never released here. A Japanese import only. Great. Great. - I'll tape it for you. - No, that's okay. Really. Cause you liked their second one, you said. Um, Pop Girls, Etc. That's the one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover. Oh, you never saw the cover, though. You just had that tape that I made you. Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one yet. Well... - I'll just make it for you. - Okay. - Dick. What's this? - It's the new ""Belle and Sebastian."" Do you like it? Holy Shiite. - What the fuck is that? - Its the new ""Belle and Sebastian"" that-- Its a record weve been listening to and enjoying, Barry. Well, thats unfortunate, because it sucks ass. Yours, I assume. Turn it off, Barry! It wont go any louder! I-- Turn it off! Okay, buddy, uh, I was just trying to cheer us up. So, go ahead. Put on some old sad bastard music. See if I care. I dont wanna hear old sad bastard music, Barry. I just want something that I can ignore. Heres the thing: I made that tape special for today. My special Monday morning tape for you, special! Well, its fucking Monday afternoon! You should get out of bed earlier! Come on, dude. Play it. Dont you wanna hear whats next? - Whats next? - Play it. Say it. ""Little Latin Loopy-Loo."" - Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels? - No! - The Righteous Brothers. - Well, never mind. No, not never mind. You tell me right now-- whats wrong with the Righteous Brothers? - Nothing. I-- I just prefer the other one. - Bullshit! How can it be bullshit to state a preference? - Since when did this store become a fascist regime? - Since you brought that bullshit tape in. Oh, man, thats great. Thats the fun thing about working in a record store. You get to play crappy pap you dont even wanna listen to. I just-- I thought this tape was gonna be a fuckin... conversation stimulator, man. I was gonna ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that... and you just had to fuckin ruin it. - Well do it next Monday. - No! I wanna do it now! I cant fire them. I hired these guys for three days a week, and they just started showing up every day. That was four years ago. Number three on the top five all-time breakup list? Charlie Nicholson. Sophomore year of college. Whoo! Am I glad thats over. As soon as I saw her I realized she was the kind of girl Id wanted to meet... ever since I was old enough to want to meet girls. I mean, she was different. She was dramatic and she was exotic. - The guy with the make-up and the tongue. - Gene Simmons. - Gene Simmons. There. And she talked a lot, and when she talked she said remarkably interesting things... about music, books, film and politics. - Yeah, Chairman Mao. - And she talked a lot. - Have you ever seen him less than feet tall? - No. - Huh? No. And you wont will you, sweetheart? No. Kiss my neck. Yeah. And she liked me. She liked me. She liked me. At least I think she did. - Do you like that one? - Yeah. Its okay. We went out for two years, and... I never got comfortable. Why would a girl-- No, a woman like Charlie go out with me? I felt like a fraud. I felt like one of those people who suddenly shave their heads and said theyd always been punks. I was sure Id be discovered at any second. And I worried about my abilities as a lover. And I was intimidated by other men in her design department... and became convinced she was gonna leave me for one of them. Then she left me for one of them. The dreaded Marco. Charlie, you fucking bitch! Lets work it out! Just open the fucking door! Charlie! Look, lets talk it-- Char-- And then I lost it. Kinda lost it all, you know? Faith, dignity, about pounds. When I came to a few months later... I found, to my surprise, I had flunked out of school. I started working in a record shop. Some people never got over Nam or the night their band opened for Nirvana. I guess I never really got over Charlie. But the thing I learned from the whole Charlie debacle is that you gotta punch your weight. See, Charlie, shes out of my class. Shes too pretty, too smart, too witty, too much. I mean, what am I? I'm a middleweight. Hey, I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but I'm certainly not the dumbest. I mean, Ive read books like ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" and ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" and I think Ive understood them. I mean, theyre about girls, right? Just kidding. But I have to say... my all-time favorite book is Johnny Cashs autobiography, Cash by Johnny Cash. - Championship. - Hi. Hi. Um, I was thinking... I could come by the house and pick up some stuff while youre at work tomorrow. While I'm at work. While I'm at work. - Oh, boy, oh, boy. - Thats what you got to say is, ""Oh, boy""? I mean, bravo. Thats-- - Laura, this is just so dumb. I mean, you should-- - Look, Rob. I gotta go. Um, I'm looking for a record for my daughter for her birthday. ""I Just Called to Say I Love You."" Do you have it? - Yeah. - Great. - We have it. - Great. - Can I have it then? - No. No, you cant. - Why not? - Well, its sentimental, tacky crap, thats why not. Do we look like the kind of store that sells ""I Just Called to Say I Love You""? Go to the mall. - Whats your problem? - Do you even know your daughter? Theres no way she likes that song. Oh-- Uh, oh, is she in a coma? Oh, okay, buddy. I didnt know it was Pick On The Middle-Aged Square Guy Day. My apologies. Ill be on my way. Bye-bye. Fuck you. Nice, Barry. Really, really nice. That was just top class. Rob. Top Five Musical Crimes Perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the80s and90s. Go. Sub-question: Is it, in fact, unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter-day sins? Is it better to burn out than to fade away? - Barry, I'm fucking broke, man! - Jesus! He was gonna buy one record, which we didnt even have, and then leave and never come back again anyway. - Thats not the point. What did he ever do to you? - He offended me with his terrible taste. It wasnt even his terrible taste. It was his daughters. Are you defending that ass-muncher? Come on, Rob. Youre going soft in your old age. Jesus! Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy. I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, pal. Thats the worst fuckin sweater Ive ever seen. Its a Cosby sweater. A Cosby sweater! Did Laura let you leave the house like that, because-- - Hey-- - Hey! Hey! - Fuckin asshole. - What are you do-- - Shut up. Will you shut up? - Uh... - Will you? - break it up. - Youre a fuckin maniac. I swear to God, if you tore this thing, its vintage, and I would fuckin sock your nose. Youll pay big. Are you all right? Yeah. Look, Dick, Laura and I broke up. Shes gone. So if you ever see Barry again, maybe you could tell him that. Of course I will, Rob. No problem. No problem at all. Ill tell him next time I see him. Definitely. Ive, uh, got some other stuff to tell him, anyway, so its no problem. Ill just tell him, you know, about Laura... um, when I tell him... the other stuff. Do you want to talk about it, that kind of thing? No. Thank you, though, Dick. Thank you. Look at these. I used to dream Id be surrounded by exotic womens underwear forever and ever. Now I know they just save their best pairs for the nights they know theyre gonna sleep with somebody. Hello, Laura, this is your mother. Your fathers angina is a little rough today. I thought he might like to talk to you. Its no big deal. I love you two. Bye-bye. Anyway, me and Charlie, we didnt match. Marco and Charlie matched. Me and Sarah, number four on the all-time list? We matched. Shed just been dumped by some asshole named Michael. I mean, Michael was such an asshole. Id just been run over by Charlie. I know exactly what you mean. I mean, its just so painful and draining. I'm just gonna be by myself for a while. Me too. Me too. It made sense to pool our collective loathing for the opposite sex. And while we were at it we could share a bed with somebody at the same time. We were frightened of being left alone for the rest of our lives. Only people of a certain disposition are frightened of being left alone for the rest of their lives at 26. We were of that disposition. - So when she told me-- - Ive met someone else. Who? Just someone else. It was contrary to the whole spirit of our arrangement. I dont have to take this shit. You think I fuckin look like shit, huh? So how come I got dumped? What? - Hey, Dick. Come on in. What is it? - Oh, um, well, were going to Lounge Axe... and, um, I was just wondering if you wanted to come along with us. Whoa. Um, Marie De Salles playing. You remember I told you about her today? I like her. Shes kind of Sheryl Crow-ish, crossed with a, um, post-Partridge Family, pre-L.A. Law Susan Dey kind of thing. - But, you know, um, black. - Yeah. So, um, I just wanted to know if you wanted to come along. Barry thought so too, really, but I guess it looks as if youre... - reorganizing your records. - Reorganizing my records. Yeah. Um, what is this, uh, chronological? No. - Not alphabetical. - Nope. What? Autobiographical. - No fucking way. - Yep. I can tell you how I got from Deep Purple to Howling Wolf in just moves. - Oh, my God. - And, if I want to find the song ""Landslide,"" by Fleetwood Mac... I have to remember that I bought it for someone in the fall of pile... but didnt give it to them for personal reasons. - That sounds-- - Comforting? - Yes. - It is. - Hello? - Well, shoo. I can stick around, you know, man, if you-- I-- if you want me to help out. But you really shouldnt, uh, keepem piled like this, because it gets really pressured. - Hold on. - You know? - See you tomorrow. - Oh. Okay. - Okay. - Ill see you. - Hi, Mom. - Hows the store? You know something? Youre very lucky that Laura is doing as well as shes doing. Because if it wasnt for her, I dont think either of us would ever sleep. She left. Shes gone. What? What do you mean? - Where did she go? - How would I know where? Shes gone. Girlfriend leave. Not say where gone. Laura move out. - Well, call her mother. - She just called. She doesnt even know. Probably the last time Ill ever hear her voice. - I'm all right, if thats whats upsetting you. - That is not whats upsetting me. - Well, it fuckin should be, shouldnt it? - I knew this would happen. - What are you gonna do, Rob? - I'm gonna drink a bottle of wine, I'm gonna watch TV and go to bed. - Then I'm gonna go to work. - And then what? I'm gonna meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk, Ill have it all figured out. Okay? - I knew-- I knew it was gonna happen again. - What are you getting so upset about? - Do you know why she left? - Its got nothing to do with marriage. - So you say! - Mom, I'm telling you for the last time. Laura didnt even want to get married. Shes not that kind of girl. - Thats not what happens now. Okay? - Oh, I dont know what happens now. Apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes! You meet someone, you move in, she goes! Shut up, Mom! God dam! Thats some cold shit. John Dillinger was shot dead behind that theatre in a hail of FBl gunfire. You know who tippedem off? His fuckin girlfriend. He just wanted to go to the movies. Is that Peter fucking Frampton? I wish I could buy words Out of season So dont Dont hesitate Cause our love Just wont wait Ooh, baby, I love your way - Rob. - Wanna tell you I love - What? - Yeah. Hey. - Your way - I always hated that song. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Now I kinda like it. - Wanna be with you night and day - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Cause I She shouldve done it on The Number Four with a Smile. Wasnt her record called Number Four with a Smile? - Thats what I said. - No, no. You said ""The Number Four with a Smile."" Theres no ""The"" at the front of the title of the album. Its a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto... uh, so I think that there is ""The,"" but I could be wrong. - You can be, and are, wrong. - Wanna tell you I love your way I wanna be with you night and day I wanna date a musician. - Cause I - I wanna live with a musician. - Feel that you - Shed write songs at home and ask me what I thought of em... and maybe even include one of our private little jokes in the liner notes. Maybe a little picture of me in the liner notes. Just in the background somewhere. - Dont hesitate - Yeah. - So, um, do you live in Chicago now? - I do. Do you love it? You should come to our record store. - Championship Vinyl. - Oh, my God, yes. Oh, youd love it. - We sell a little bit of anything that matters. - He owns it. Its on Milwaukee. - Rock, soul, trip-hop, salsa. - Ska, techno and pop. - Will you come? - Yeah, Marie. - Okay, okay. - Sounds good. - Championship Vinyl. - Championship Vinyl. - Enjoyed your set. Thank you. - Barry, whyd you tell her about the store, man? - Oh, man, I'm sorry. I didnt know it was classified information. I mean, I know we dont have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing... not, like, a business strategy. Rob? Its Liz. Just calling to see if, you know, well, youre okay. Look, I'm your friend too, so I'm not taking sides. Yet. - Shadows grow so long before my eyes - Give me a call. Okay? Bye. - Hi. - What are you doing here? - Took the morning off. - Come on, Rob. Do you still love me? Well, its not really the issue, is it? Why? I mean, what else is there? What do you mean? What else is there? I dont know. It doesnt change the way we dont get along at all. In fact, I hope were not in love any more, to be honest. - It would give me a better opinion of love right now. - Come on! What, did I beat you? Did I tell you were a bad person? I mean, what the fuck? - What should I have done to make you happy? - Nothing. Make yourself happy. Oh, I see. Um, wh-why am I not happy? Because youre the same person you used to be... and I'm not. - And all Ive done is change jobs. - Clothes and hairstyles. - Attitudes and friends. - I couldnt go to work with my hair dyed pink. - Youre harder. - You havent changed so much as a pair of socks since Ive known you. - Oh, come on, Laura. Now youre just being stupid. - At least you used to talk about the future. Now you dont even do that. - Look, I'm all right. Youre the one that hates her job. - See? You havent got a clue. I like my job. All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people... most of all to yourself. And you dont, Rob. So whats the use? Rob, its your turn. Okay, I'm feeling kinda basic today. Top Five Side Ones, Track Ones. ""Janie Jones,"" The Clash, from The Clash. ""Lets Get It On,"" Marvin Gaye, from Lets Get It On."" Nirvana, ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" off of Never mind. Oh, no, Rob, thats not obvious enough. Not at all. How about, uh, ""Point of No Return"" on Point of No Return? - Louis, you couldnt get up-- - Shut up. Shut up. - ""White LightWhite Heat,"" Velvet Underground. - Okay, that would be on my list. - Though not on mine. - And Massive Attack, No Protection. - The song is ""Radiation Ruling the Nation."" - Ohh! - Kind of a new record. Very-- - Excuse me. I was in here last night-- - In a minute. Very nice, Rob. A sly declaration of new classic status slipped into a list of old safe ones. Very pussy. - Excuse me, I was in here last-- - In a minute. Couldnt you be any more obvious than that, Rob? How about, uh, I dont know, the Beatles? How about fucking-- fucking Beethoven? Track one, side one of the Fifth Symphony. How can someone who has no interest in music own a record store? Do you still have that, uh, Beefheart French import, Safe as Milk? Um, lets see. Ah, yes, here it is. Yes. - How much you want for it? - Uh-- Yes-- Oh, no. You know what? - I dont think I'm selling it this week. Maybe next week. - Oh, no. You said that last week. Did I? Yeah, well, I just-- I-- Uh-- Nicely played. You know, I dont have that record. Ill buy it for 40. - Rob? - Sold. - Now, why would you sell it to me and not to him? - Because youre not a geek, Louis. - You guys are snobs. - No, were not. - No, seriously, youre totally elitist. You feel like the unappreciated scholars, so you shit on the people who know less than you. - No. - Which is everybody. - Yes. Its just sad, thats all. I'm sick of the sight of this place. Some days I'm afraid Ill go berserk... throw the country ""A"" through ""K"" rack out on the street... and go work at a Virgin Megastore and never come back. - Hello. - Hey, Liz. - Hey, Rob. You know, just wanted to call and thank you for that message you sent me last night. It really made me feel like less of an asshole. Oh. Well, how are you holding up? Good. Good. I mean, look, maybe were just not right for each other, right? - I mean, or maybe we are. - Mmm. Yeah. Time will tell at this point, and if its time to move on, its time to move on. I dont know. I-- I dont want to take sides and-- And I like you with Laura. I think you guys are good together. And I dont think much of this Ian guy. Rob, Marie De Salle is in the store. I gotta go, Liz. - We should maybe turn off her music. - I know. Hey. I like the music. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I can go turn it off if you want. You might be sick of it. - You should turn it up. - Oh, right, yeah. - Yeah. Okay, let me go do that after I go do something else that I have to go do. - All righty. Hmm. - Yeah, I got the, uh-- Excuse me. Okay? What fucking Ian guy? Laura doesnt know anybody called Ian. Theres no Ian in her office. She has no friends called Ian! I'm almost certain she has never met anyone named Ian in her entire life. She lives in an... ""Ian-less"" universe. ""I. Raymond."" Ray. ""I."" Ian. Mr. I. Raymond. Ray to his friends, and more importantly to his neighbor. The guy who, until about six weeks ago, lived upstairs. I start to remember things about him now. His horrible clothes and hair. His music: Latin, Bulgarian, whatever world music was trendy that week. He had rings on his fingers. Awful cooking smells. I never liked him much then, and I fuckin hate him now. We used to listen to him having sex upstairs. Jeez, he goes on long enough. Mm-hmm. I should be so lucky. It feels so good You are as abandoned and noisy as any character in a porn film, Laura. You are Ians plaything, responding to his touch with shrieks of orgasmic delight. No woman in the history of the world is having better sex than the sex you are having with Ian... in my head. Oh, baby, give it up Aint no use Number five: Jackie Alden. Jackie Aldens breakup had no effect on my life whatsoever. It was a casual thing, and I was glad when it ended. I just slotted her in to bump Laura out of position. But now, congratulations, Laura. You made it to the top five. Number five with a bullet. Welcome. Wont somebody please Help me with my misery - Cant somebody see - Hey. Do you have soul? What this one loves done to me That all depends. - Now I know, I know - Back row, right next to the blues. Championship Vinyl. Yeah. Yeah, I'm interested. Sure. Whats your address? - Hey, Liz. - Hey, Rob. You fucking asshole! Hi, Barry. Soarin and borin I feel I'm ignorin My time in the world Have you heard For a couple of years I was a deejay at a club. I was good at it, I think... and while I was doing it is the happiest Ive ever been. And thats where I met Laura. She was already a lawyer, but she worked for Legal Aid... hence the leatherjacket and the clubbing. Oh, I liked her right away. - Hey! - Hey! - Thats a kick-ass record. - What? - Thats a kick-ass record. - Yeah. I know. - Um, whats your name? - Laura. Hey. I was gonna say, come back next week and Ill make you a tape. - All right. Thank you. - Okay? - Great. - Rob. - I'm still Laura. To be honest, I hadnt met anyone as promising as Laura since I started deejaying... and meeting promising women is kind of what the deejaying thing is supposed to be about. And anyway, we-- we moved on from there. She lost her lease on her apartment in Lakeview, and she moved in with me. And it stayed that way for years. She didnt make me miserable, or anxious... or ill-at-ease. And you know, it sounds boring, but it wasnt. It wasnt spectacular, either. It was just... good. But really good. So, how come I'm suddenly an asshole? I get the feeling that Liz talked to Laura... and Liz stuck up for me... and Laura told her a few things. I dont know what precisely Laura said, but she would have revealed at least two, maybe even all four of the following pieces of information. One: that I slept with someone else... - He slept with somebody else. - What? while she, Laura, was pregnant. - While I was pregnant. - No! Two: that my affair directly contributed-- Pretty much directly to me terminating the pregnancy. - No. - Three: that after the abortion, I borrowed a large sum of money from her... - Four grand or so. - and have not, as of yet, repaid any of it. The bastard! Four: that shortly before she left me... I told her that I was kind of unhappy in the relationship... and maybe sort of looking around for someone else. He was ""sort of, maybe"" looking around for somebody else. - Did I do and say those things? - Yes. - No! - Yes, I did. I am a fuckin asshole. - Thats it. - Liz-- No. Sit down. Sit down. Thats shocking. That is shocking. First of all, the money. Laura had it and I didnt. And she wanted to give it to me. Ive never been able to pay her back because Ive never been able to. Just because she moved in with some Supertramp fan... it doesnt make me five grand richer. And number two, this stuff about me half-looking around for someone else? She tricked me into saying it. We were having this State-of-the-Union type conversation... and she said, quite matter of factly, that we were pretty unhappy at the moment. And did I agree? And I said yes. And she asked me whether I ever thought about meeting other people. So then I asked her if she ever thought about meeting someone else. She says, ""Of course."" So I admit that, yes, I daydream about it from time to time. Now I can see what we were really talking about is her and Ian... and she suckered me into absolving her. It was a sneaky lawyers trick and I fell for it... because shes much smarter than me. All right, then the pregnancy. I didnt know she was pregnant. Of course I didnt. I didnt know because she hadnt told me. She hadnt told me because I had told her that I had sor-- Yes, Id slept with someone else. So I didnt find out she was pregnant till way later. We were going through this good period and I made some crack about having kids and-- - What? - and she just burst into tears. And I said, ""Well, what is it,"" you know. ""What--"" And I made her tell me, and she did... and I went into this brief and ill-advised bout of self-righteousness, you know-- What right do you have? My child too-- blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That pretty much brings us up to date. Who needs a drink? Who loves the sun Who cares that it makes plants grow Whats wrong with me? Seriously. What happened? Why am I doomed to be left? Doomed to be rejected? I need answers. Number one. To Alison Ashmore. - Hello? - This is, uh, Rob Gordon calling. - Hi. - I'm an old friend of Alisons and, um-- - What did you say your name was? - Rob. Rob Gordon. Um, I was actually her-- her first boyfriend in-in-in the seventh grade... and I was just wondering if you had any way of reaching her or her number or-- I hate to quibble with you, Rob, but Alison married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister. He is her first and last boyfriend. - You gotta be kidding me. - Uh, no, I'm quite serious. She is Mrs. Kevin Bannister. She lives in Australia. - We went out together in the seventh grade. - I beg your pardon. Well, technically, I'm her first boyfriend, okay? I met her a few days before Kevin did. Technically, number one. Me. - I dont know what you mean by ""technically."" - You know. I'm number one. Me. Technically. I see. Well, maybe its my mistake. Ive got to go now, Bob. Okay, bye-bye. Who loves the sun Alison married Kevin! I am fine now! Married her junior high school sweetheart. Kissed me on the bench. Kissed Kevin on the bench. Married Kevin. This is great! This has got nothing to do with me. This is fate. This is destiny. It is beyond my control, beyond my fault. I love this! I want more. I want to see the others on the big top five. I wanna see Penny and Charlie and Sarah, all of them, you know. Just seeem and talk toem, you know, like a Bruce Springsteen song. You call, you askem how they are, and you see if theyve forgiven you. Yeah, and then-- and then Id feel good. And theyd feel good. No, theyd feel good maybe, but youd feel better. Id feel clean and calm. Thats what youre looking for. You wanna get ready to start again, thatd be good for you. Great, even. Youd give that big final ""good luck and goodbye"" to your all-time top five and just move on down the road. Good luck. Goodbye. Thanks, Boss. Penny is as beautiful as she was in high school and really grown into herself. She reviews movies for a living, which is unassailably cool... even if she does make these little notes with this little flashlight pen. We have a good time, and we hate the same actors, and everythings going great. She tells me about her life. I tell her about mine. We both get it. We both relate. And then, with no real explanation, I just launch into it. I tell her about how Laura wanted to sleep with Ian and not me... Charlie wanted to sleep with Marco and not me... Alison Ashmore wanted Kevin Bannister and not me. And you, you wanted to-- you wanted to have sex with Chris Thompson... and not me. And I was helping-- hoping you could help me understand why this keeps happening... why, you know, I'm doomed to be left, doomed to be rejected. Do you understand? Well, Rob, uh, I was crazy about you. I wanted to sleep with you one day, but not when I was 16. You know, when you broke up with me-- you broke up with me because I was, I was... to use your charming expression, tight... I cried and I cried and I hated you... and when that little shit bag asked me out and I was too tired to fight him off... it wasnt rape, because I said okay, but it wasnt far off. You know I couldnt have sex until after college because I hated it so much? Thats when youre supposed to have sex, Rob-- in college! And now you want to have a little chat about rejection. Well, fuck you, Rob. God, shes right. I broke up with her. I rejected her. Thats another one I dont have to worry about. I shouldve done this years ago. Maam, could I get the cheque, please? Next up, Charlie. But I'm not quite ready for that... so I go directly to number four on the all-time breakup list. Sarah, my partner in rejection who rejected me. - Hi, Rob. - Hi. Nice to see you. - Hi. Okay, yeah. - Nice to see you. - Yeah. - You want me to come-- - You wanna-- - Sure. - You wanna-- - Yeah. - Yeah, lets go out a bit. I cant believe I left you for him. - Probably seemed like a good idea at the time, Sarah. - Yeah, I dont know why, though. - Are you seeing anybody? - Um, no, yeah. - No? - Yeah. I mean, I'm not-- - No. I-I-I am. I'm in between things. How are you doin? - Me? I'm not good. - Really? - No. Oh, its so hard. The medication I was on is not working. So were trying something else, but its like, they dont know about it, so I'm like a guinea pig, and-- But I'm making money. Thats good, cause I lost my job a month ago. - So its been, like, hand-to-mouth-- - No, I havent got the heart for the rejection conversation. There are no hard feelings here, and I'm glad she ditched me and not the other way around. I'm late for work, and I-- Ill call you. - Okay. - Nice to see you. Bye. - Bye. See you later. I couldve wound up having sex back there. And what better way to exorcise rejection demons than to screw the person who rejected you, right? But you wouldnt be sleeping with a person. Youd be sleeping with a whole, sad single-person culture. Itd be like sleeping with Talia Shire in Rocky if you werent Rocky. I feel guilty enough as it is. Theres only Charlie left now. Shes in the fuckin phone book. She should be living on Neptune. Shes an extraterrestrial. A ghost, a myth, not a person in a phone book. - Hi, this is Charlie. - Answering machine. - Leave me a message-- - Ill leave a nice, polite message and shell never call back. Oh, the Killing Moon EP, its almost impossible to find, especially on CD. Yet another cruel trick played on all the dumb-asses who got rid of their turntables. - But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album-- - Yeah, I have all the other ones. Oh, you do? Well, how about the Jesus and Mary Chain? - Ah, they always seemed-- - They always seemed what? They always seemed really great is what they always seemed. They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and youre sittin around complainin about no more Echo albums. I cant believe you dont own this fucking record. Thats insane. Jesus! - Can I get two receipts with that? - Well, the interesting thing about Green Day... is that so much of their music is, in truth... directly influenced by, in my opinion, uh, two bands-- - The Clash-- - The Clash. Uh, correct, uh, the Clash. Uh, but also by this band called, uh, Stiff Little Fingers. Um, I think you would really love this band. Uh, it sounds great. - My names Anaugh. - The name-- Um, my names Dick. Is this the new Green Day? You dont have it? That is perverse. Dont tell anybody you dont own fucking Blonde on Blonde. Its gonna be okay. I will now sell five copies of the three EPs by the Beta Band. Do it. If theres something inside that you wanna say Say it loud Itll be okay I will be all right I will be all right I will be all right I will be all right If theres something inside that you wanna say - You can say it loud, itll be okay - Who is that? - Its the Beta Band. - Its good. I know. - Barry! The door! - Fuck! - Go! Go! Go! - Go, go, go, go! - Gotta go back! - Hey! Okay, fuckos, how much is this deck worth to you, and how much did you steal? Can you do the math? - Barry, call the cops. - No! - Hold up, hold up. Ryuichi Sakamoto, Sigue Sigue Sputnik, Breakbeats, Serge Gainsbourg. - What, are you guys stealing for other people? - No, those are for us. - You guys slamming to Joni Mitchell now? - Man, youre, like, so bigoted. - You look at us and think you know what we listen to. - I think you have more. Okay. Hi. - What do you want? - I thought I could give you a ride back. - Are you coming home? - Yeah. Well, Id like to come over to your house to pick up some things. My house. Howd it go today? All right. - Do you want to go? - Sure. So, have you tackled the great reorganization yet? You bet. You can take this with you if you want. Look at this place. Laura, its a dump. What are you making now? Sixty, seventy a year? And you were living in this shithole. Bet you cant even remember what you were doing here. I was here because I wanted to be with you. It had nothing to do with this place. So, uh, where are you staying now? I think you know that. - I had to work that out for myself, though, didnt I? - I'm sorry. I know I havent been very fair. Thats why I came to the store tonight. It took me a while to work up the courage. - You scared now? - Yes, of course I am. I feel terrible, Rob. You know, this is really hard. Good. So how is everything going with Ian? Is it working out okay? - Youre living with the guy. - Dont. I'm just asking you how its going. Look, I'm not living with the guy, okay? I'm just staying with him for a few days until I figure out what I'm doing. I left because we werent exactly getting along, and we werent talking about it. I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together... and I cant really see that ever happening with you. And, yes, I sort of got interested in someone else. And that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go. But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run. Probably nothing. So, what? You definitely havent decided to dump me? Is that it? Theres still a chance we might get back together? - I dont know. - Well, if you dont know... theres a chance, right? I mean, it would be like if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill... and the doctor said, ""I dont know if this patient has a chance of survival or not."" That doesnt mean that the patients definitely gonna die now, does it? I mean, he might live. - Even if its a remote possibility. - I suppose so. - So we have a chance of not-- - Shut up, Rob. - I just want to know where I stand here. What chance do we have? - What-- - I dont know what chance we have. - If you could tell me roughly- All right, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. - Nine? - Nine. - Great. - Look, I know I'm asking a lot... but could you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up? No problem. - You want me to leave my own house? - Yes, please. Laura, can I ask you one question? Yes. One. - Youre not gonna like it. - Just ask it. - Is it better? - Is what better? Better than what? Well, sex, I guess. Is it better? - Is that really whats bothering you? - Yes. Yes, of course. Do you really think it would make a difference either way? - I dont know. - Well, the answer is, I dont know either. We havent done it yet. - Never? - I havent felt like it. Not even before, when he was living upstairs? No. I was living with you, remember? Weve slept together, but we havent made love. Not yet. - Ill tell you one thing. - What? Sleeping together is better. Sleeping together is better? But not the sex, because you havent done it yet? - Will you please just go? - Yeah. We are the champions - My friends - Yes! - And well keep on fighting - Putem up! - Till the end - I feel good. I feel great. - We are the champions - I feel like a new man. - I feel so much better, in fact... - We are the champions - that I go straight out and sleep with Marie De Salle. - No time for losers Cause we are the champions ""How could this have happened?"" you ask. ""How does he-- How does he do it?"" How does a regular guy like me become the number one lover man in his particular postal district? Hes grumpy. Hes broke. He hangs out with the musical moron twins... and yet he gets to go to bed with somebody like Marie De Salle. Hey. Marie. - Everything go all right? - Yeah, yeah. She just wanted to pick up some stuff, you know. It was no big deal. It was just-- I hate that time, picking-up-stuff time. - You know that song I play, ""Eartha Kitt Times Two""? - Of course! I wrote that about me and my ex dividing our record collection. Its a great, great song. - A while back, Dick, Barry and I agreed.... - I wrote that just before I moved here. that what really matters is what you like... not what you are like. Books, records, films-- These things matter. Call me shallow. Its the fuckin truth. And by this measure, I was having one of the best dates of my life. - You love that show? - Yes! Starring, um-- Starring, um-- Who starred in The Prisoner? - McGoohan. - Patrick McGoohan. - Thats right! And then we talk about our exes. Shes dry and self-deprecating. Great sense of humour about it, and I can really see why her songs are so good. - I guess shes happy with him. - I dont speak about Laura with as much depth. But it feels, even to me, like I'm being intimate. I express regret. I say nice things about her... and I hint at a deep ocean of melancholy just below the surface... which is all bullshit really. Ive just invented a sketch of a decent, sensitive guy... because I'm in the position to invent him. And I guess all that charming, nervous stuff seems to work somehow... because we get back to her house and... Throw my suitcase out there too it just happens. - Throw my covers out the door - And then we make love. Its great. - I dont need them any more - And thats it. I'm not gonna go into all that other stuff. You know, the who-did-what-to-whom stuff. You know that song ""Behind Closed Doors"" by Charlie Rich? Its one of my favorite songs. - I can say we had a good time. I can say that. - Should I have left this town Maries a terrific woman. But it was more than I could do And then in the morning-- You didnt have me fooled... acting all cool about, um, whats-her-name. - Laura. - Laura, right, right. Laura. - What was yours called again? - It was called James. - James. - James. Do you miss him? Yeah. Thats how it works, right? I think its okay if you feel horny and fucked up at the same time. I mean, why should we be denied our basic human rights... just cause we messed up our relationships? You think sex is a basic human right? Hell, yeah! Yeah. I'm not gonna let that asshole come between me and a fuck. - Which way are you going? - That way. You? - That way. - Ah, so it is. - Talk to ya. - Ill call you. Right. What did Laura mean last night when she said, ""I havent slept with him yet""? Yet! What does ""yet"" mean anyway? It means youre gonna do it, doesnt it? Or does it? Just come on. What would it mean to you, that sentence: ""I havent seen Evil Dead yet""? Well, to me it would mean that youre a liar. Youve seen it twice. Once with Laura-- oops-- and once with me and Dick, remember? We had that conversation about the guy making Beretta shotgun ammo off-screen in the 14th century. Right. All right, but lets just say that I hadnt seen it... and I said to you, ""I havent seen Evil Dead yet,"" what would you think? Id think that youre a cinematic idiot, and Id feel sorry for you. All right. But from that one sentence, would you think that I was going to see it? I'm sorry, Rob. I'm struggling here. Youre asking me what would I think if you told me... you hadnt seen a film that you have already seen. - What am I supposed to say? - Just listen to me. If I said to you-- ""I havent seen Evil Dead yet,"" yes. Would you get the impression that I really wanted to see it? Oh, uh, well... you couldnt have been desperate to see it, otherwise youd have already gone. Right. I'm not gonna see that movie. But the word ""yet."" Yeah, you know what? I get the impression that you wanted to see it... otherwise youd have said you didnt want to go. But in your opinion, would I definitely go? How the fuck am I supposed to know? Probably. - Why? - Because its a brilliant film. Its so funny and violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass. I never thought Id say this, but can I go work now? Look, Laura, if you dont want me to call you at work, then give me your home number. Oh, I forgot. You cant. I'm not gonna get off this phone until you agree to meet me for a drink. I mean, I'm sorry, but I dont just see why this has to be on your terms... - all the time. - Okay. - I mean, really. - Okay! Okay. Well meet then tonight. Thatd-- Thatd be great if youre not too busy. Itll be really good to... see you. So how are you? Have you slept with him yet? - Is that why you wanted to see me? - I guess. What do you want me to say? I want you to say you havent, and I want that to be the truth. I cant do that. Say a word for Jimmy Brown He aint got nothinat all You must have known it would happen. You couldnt have been entirely unprepared. Like you said, Ive been living with the guy. We were bound to get around to it sometime. Rob, are you there? What are you thinking? We can meet for another drink if you want. So I can explain it better. I owe you that much. I dont have your number. You know, I dont want this to be the last conversation we have. I know what youre like. You do, huh? I need a second opinion. Hi, this is Tim. City and state, please. Uh, Chicago. A residence. Mr. Ian Raymond. - Please hold for that number. - May I also have that address? - Certainly. - Thank you. - Rob? - Laura, I just want to say something. I think youre running. Youre running from a, a sharp point... that anybody hits in any relationship, and its just gonna happen again. But its gonna be with this guy Ian, later, when youre older. All right? With a guy with a Steven Seagal ponytail. You know what I'm saying? And-And he doesnt love you. And he doesnt understand you, not the way I will. And I will even more so in the future. And-- I mean, if you want to experiment or whatever-- I'm not experimenting. Why dont you go experiment? - Laura, are you okay? - Uh, yeah, I'm fine. - Is that him? - Look, can you-- Can you call me at work? I gotta go now. - You look upset. - Yeah, I'm-- I'm upset... but I'm fine. - Maybe I should talk to him. - No, I dont think thats a good idea. - Conflict resolution is my job. - Yeah, I know. But-- But, Ian, theres really nothing to resolve, but thank you. You have got to stop calling her. Youre really upsetting her and him! - Like I care about him. - Well, you should. - Why? - Because all youre doing is forming a little unit. Them against you! Before you started all this psychotic madness, there was no unit. There was just three people in a mess. But now theyve got something in common. And you dont want to make anything worse. How could it get any worse than Laura with Ian? - Come on, Liz. - Rob, Rob, Rob. Can I ask you a question? And you can think about it if you want to. Just what is it? Why do you want Laura back so badly? Rob, phone. I was walking on the water when I saw a crocodile Barry, that fucking pricers busted, and I'm not the one who broke it. - Hello. - Rob? Who is this? Is this Ch-- Is this Charlie? Hi. I just got back into town. Wow! Rob Gordon. The Rob Gordon. So how are you doing? Huh? Does it seem like millions of years ago? Yeah, yeah. Like a billion, right? So, uh-- God, Charlie Nicholson. How are you? I mean, do you have kids and stuff like everybody else? No. No, I'm too young, too single. I dont know. Kids are too time-consuming, I guess, is the expression I'm looking for. I'm not making this up. This is how she talks-- as if nobody ever had... a conversation about having kids in the entire history of the world. Shes incredible. So, anyway, are you in or out, Rob? - I'm sorry? - Well, you know-- I dont know. I just find these long-lost boyfriend calls a little unnerving. - Theres been a rash of them recently. - Is that right? Yeah. Oh, remember Marco? I went out with him after you. - Kind of. - Kind of, yeah. Well, he called a few months ago. I think he was going through one of those what-does-it-all-mean kind of things. He wanted to see me and ""rehash the past, ""as they say. God. Was I up for that? No. No. So-- I dont know-- - Do all men go through that? - Ive never heard of it before. I'm sorry, Charlie, but what does ""Are you in or out"" mean? Well, it means, are we friends or arent we? Because if we are, thats great. Thats great. But if were not, I dont really want to spend time playing catch-up on the phone. You know what I mean? Im just really busy, you know? Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Of course. - So, are you in or out, Rob? - I'm in. I'm in. I'm in. Oh, yeah? Great. Do you want to come for a dinner party tomorrow night? Have you ever watched a moonbeam Can I help you? - As it slide across your windowpane - Hello, Rob. Remember me? Ray. Ian. I thought maybe we should talk. You know, sort things out. - What needs sorting out? - Ten phone calls a night. Hanging around outside my house. - Ive stopped all of that now. - You were there this morning. Obviously, I know how special Laura is, and I know how... much pain you must be going through right now. I would hate it if I lost her. Oh. Guess who? But Id like to believe that if she decided... that she didnt want to see me any more that... I would respect those wishes. You know what I'm saying, G? - Yeah. - Good. So shall we leave it at that then? Ive already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck! Now, get your patchouli stink out of my store! Move it, lard-ass! Dumb motherfucker. So, um, shall we leave it at that then? - Tsk. No. - Dont! Dont! - Hes not worth it! - Leave town! Leave the country! You little bitch! Cause youll look back at ten phone calls a night as the golden age! Get ready, motherfucker! So shall we leave it at that then? Get him! - Come on! Get him! - Get him, man! - Have you ever watched a moonbeam - Well, think about it, Rob. Okay? As it slide across your windowpane Hey, jelly bean. Charles. - How are you? - Good. How are you? Actually, its hilarious. Its hilarious. Hey, everybody! Everybody, this is Rob. Rob, this is everybody. - Hi. - Hi. - Come on in. Make yourself at home. Is that for me? - Yeah. - Oh, its a little warm. Ill put it in the fridge. - I think if you get a dog... - youve got to raise it yourself. - Your place doesnt have a yard, does it? - You got to deal with a dog from day one. - Of course you do. - You gotta take care of it, raise it-- - Yeah, but-- - Do you want a drink? - Yeah, I would. I can see now that I'm doomed to die... a long, slow suffocating death, and I try to figure out why. Of course theres envy. Why isnt my life like this? Sure, I want their money and clothes and jobs and opinions. And Id like to have advice on jet lag, but thats not it. I mean, theyre not bad people, and I'm not a class warrior. Its something else. - I never did. I never did. And I was very supportive-- - And then it dawned on me. - It came down to me to tell him the truth. - Charlies awful. What was the truth? - She doesnt listen to anyone. She says terrible, stupid things... - No. Well, I have-- - and she apparently has no sense of humour at all... - Youre right. I have to talk-- and talks shit all night long. - Come here, you. Oh, I love you. - Bye-bye. - Maybe shes been like this all along. - Bye, sweetheart. - Bye-bye. - Call me tomorrow, okay? - Thanks for having us. Call me. Promise to call me. Bye. How did I manage to edit all this out? How had I made this girl the answer to all the worlds problems? - Hey, Charlie. - Hey, Rob. So, Charlie, whyd you dump me for Marco? Fuck! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! - What? - You are. You are going through... one of those what-does-it-all-mean things. - I cant believe you, Rob. - Yes, I am. Very much. Indeed so. - Oh, God. - Come on. Answer the question. Oh, come on, Charlie. Dont hold back. You can say whatever you like. Whyd you dump me for Marco? Marco just seemed to be a bit more glamorous. You know? More sure of himself. Less hard work. A little sunnier. Sparkier. Through the park Make love along the way - In Mendocino - You put that ad up? - Yeah. - What can you play? Nothin. What kind of stuff are you into? The kind of stuff you mentioned. But we want to be more experimental than that. We want to retain our pop sensibilities, but, kind of, you know, go a little further out. - That sounds great. - No gigs yet. We just got together. Is Tuesday night cool for you? - Well just, you know... - What I have told you - jam. - Yeah. - Can you dig it All right. Later. - What? - What do you mean, what? Youve had that poster up on the wall for, like, 17,000 years. And then some guy comes in off the street. You act like its no big deal. Its just a garage band. Its nothing special. - Barry, you dont even play an instrument. - I can sing. What, you think I'm gonna stick around here the rest of my life? Hey, its half past a monkeys ass. Lets go. Oh, I cant, um, meet you guys at the club tonight. - Thats the way it is in Mendocino - Why? - Who are you going to see? - Mendocino - Nobody. - Rob! Lookie, lookie! Dick, are you getting some? - Mendocino Un-fucking-believable! Dicks got a hot date! How did this happen, Dick? What rational explanation can there possibly be? Whats her name? - Anaugh. - Anaugh? Anaugh Conda? - Anaugh Moss. - Anaugh Moss? Is she all green and fuzzy and mossy? And you met this bruiser where exactly? The home for the mentally challenged or the blind or the bus station? Um, here. She asked me about the, uh, new Green Day album... - and then I told her-- - Oh, man! Finally! Anaugh. Thats great, Dick! Really, smoke that ass. Listen, Rob, I cant go to the club either. I gotta get some lyrics down on paper. Oh, yeah, me too. Well, not, uh, lyrics to get down. But, um, uh-- So Ill see you, um, tomorrow. - Hi, Laura. - ""Top five dream jobs."" - Hey, thats private. - ""Number one: ""journalist for Rolling Stone magazine, to 1979. ""Get to meet the Clash, Chrissie Hynde, Sex Pistols, David Byrne. ""Get tons of free records. Number two: ""producer, Atlantic Records, to 1971. Get to meet Aretha, Wilson Pickett, Solomon Burke."" - More free records. - ""More free records and a shitload of money."" - Yeah. - ""Number three: any kind of musician."" Besides classical or rap. - ""Settle for being one of the Memphis Horns or something."" - Sure. - ""I'm not asking to be Jagger or Hendrix or Otis Redding."" - Uh-huh. - ""Number four: film director."" - Any kind except German or silent. And number five, we have ""architect."" - Yeah. - Seven years training. - I'm not sure I even want to be an architect. - So youve got a list here... of five things youd do if qualifications... and time and history and salary were no object? - Yeah. - One of them you dont really want to do anyway. Well, I did put it at number five. Wouldnt you rather own your own record store than be an architect? - Yeah, I suppose. - And you wouldnt want to be a... 16th-century explorer or the king of France or-- - God, no. - All right. There you go then. Dream job number five: record store owner. I find it interesting that you keep showing up here, Laura. Well, this is the last of it. Those bags look heavy. Wheres Ian? Or Ray or-- What is his fucking name anyway? - What do you call him? Ian or Ray? - Ray. - I hate Ian. - I hate him too. Yeah, I'm sure. See ya. Goodbye. Top five things I miss about Laura. One: sense of humour. Very dry, but it can also be warm and forgiving. And shes got one of the best all-time laughs in the history of all-time laughs. She laughs with her entire body. Two: Shes got character. Or at least she had character before the Ian nightmare. Shes loyal and honest and... she doesnt even take it out on people when shes having a bad day. Thats character. Three: I miss her smell... and the way she tastes. Its a mystery of human chemistry, and I dont understand it. Some people, as far as your senses are concerned, just feel like home. I really dig how she walks around. Its like she doesnt care how she looks or what she projects. And its not that she doesnt care, its just-- Shes not affected, I guess. And that gives her grace. And five: She does this thing in bed when she cant get to sleep. She kind of half-moans and then rubs her feet together an equal number of times. It just kills me. Believe me, I mean, I could do a top-five-things about her that drive me crazy... but its just your garden variety women, you know, schizo stuff... and thats the kind of thinking that got me here. - Look out! - Damn! You maggots! Whoa, whoa! Toss it, man! - Youre pretty when youre angry. - Shit! - Hey, Rob, Laura called. - Really? What you gonna do The mans gone out to get you How you gonna know - What is this? - Its Vince and Justin. - Whos Vince and Justin? - Its those little skate fuckers. - No way. - Way. Its really-- Its really fuckin good. Hey, do you guys know Vince and Justin, the guys that come in my store? - Yeah, theyre right over there, man. - Thanks. - No problem. - Quit smoking. I'm telling you should-- - Hey! Your tape. - Its good. - I know. We made it. - Its all right. Thank you. I mean, its rough, but, unbelievably, it shows promise. Ill put out your record. Any profits we split down the middle after I recoup expenses, okay? Recoup expenses? Man, youre gonna recoup a big, fat Mercedes is what youre gonna do. - Were not there yet, Justin. - I'm Vince. Whatever. Whats the name of your band? - Uh, the Kinky Wizards. - Nice. Whats the name of your label? Top Five Records. What was that? You just told them youre gonna put out a record with them? Yeah. So what? You said yourself those guys were good. What are you getting hot about? Well, it just seems that you think it would be wiser to start a record label... by putting out a record with business-crippling Nazi youth shoplifters... than with someone you know in your bitter, jealous heart is a musical visionary, thats all. Yeah, what do your songs sound like? Sex Pistols? Nirvana? Pop Abrams and the Smurfs? You know what? You wouldnt be familiar with our immediate influences. - Try me. - Theyre mostly German. - Kraftwerk? Falco? Hasselhoff? Hey. You called? Fuckin asshole. - Laura, are you all right? - My dad-- My dad died. - Whats up? - Lauras dad died. Oh, drag. I'm sorry, Rob. Hey, top five songs about death. A Lauras dad tribute list. Okay? Okay. ""Leader Of The Pack."" The guy fuckin beefs it on his motorcycle and dies, right? ""Dead Mans Curve."" Jan and Dean. Do you know that right after they recorded that song, Jan himself, um, crashed his-- - It was Dean, you fuckin idiot. - it was Jan. - It was a long time after the song-- - Okay, whatever. ""Tell Laura I Love Her."" That would bring the house down. Lauras mom could sing it. - You know what Id want? - Huh? ""One Step Beyond"" by Madness. No, no, no, no, no. Wh-When are you going home? In a minute, when I get it together. And, uh, ""You Cant Always Get What You Want."" No, immediate disqualification because of its involvement with The Big Chill. Oh, God, youre right. Um, Mom wants you to come to the funeral. - Oh. Me? - Yeah, cause my dad really liked you, and... Mom never told him wed split, because he wasnt up to it. ""Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald."" Uh, Gordon Lightfoot. Bastard. Thats so good. That should have been mine. Do you, uh-- Do you want me there? I dont care, as long as you dont expect me to hold your hand. - Is Ray going? - No! The night Lauras daddy died Sha-na-na, na-na-na na-na-na-na-na Brother, what a night it really was Mother, what a night it really-- Anginas tough Glory be Brother, what a night it really was Brother, what a night Anginas tough-- Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done... - on Earth as it is in heaven. - Songs at my funeral: - Bless this day-- - ""Many Rivers To Cross"" by Jimmy Cliff. ""Angel"" by Aretha Franklin... and Ive always had this fantasy that some beautiful, tearful woman will insist on... ""Youre The Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me"" by Gladys Knight. - But who would that woman be? - Amen. - Hey, Jo. - Hi, Liz. - Hey. - How are you doing? - I'm all right, I suppose. Moms not too bad. But Laura-- I dont know. Yeah, well, shes had a rough time of it already without this. Its just so hard when you put all of your efforts into one area of your life... and it doesnt work out. Dont mind me. Really. Its no problem. Just pretend like youre talking about someone else. Its okay. Well, in fact, we are talking about someone else. Were talking about Laura. - Oh. - Oh? Dont fuckin say ""oh"" like that to me, Liz. I'm really sorry, Jo. Look, I can either stick up for myself... or I can believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself. But thats not much of a life, is it? Huh? - I mean-- - Do you think this is really the time to be talking about-- Just because its never the time, Liz? I cant go on apologizing my whole life. I think just the once would do! - I'm very sorry, Laura. - Thanks for coming. I'm so sorry, Laura. Thank you. I appreciate that. Laura, I'm sorry. Most of the time I'm clear-focused allaround Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground I can follow the path I can read the sign Stay right with it when the road unwinds I can handle whatever I stumble upon I dont even notice shes gone - I can see now I never really committed to Laura. - Most of the time I always had one foot out the door... and that prevented me from doing a lot of things... like thinking about my future and-- - I guess it made more sense to commit to nothing. - Most of the time - Keep my options open. - Its well understood - And thats suicide. - Most of the time - By tiny, tiny increments. - I wouldnt change it if I could I can make it all match up I can hold my own I can deal with the situation Right down to the bone I can survive and I can endure Hell, I dont even think About her Most of the time Are you gonna lie in that flower bed all night? No. - Youre soaking. - Yeah. Youre also an idiot. - Look, Laura, I'm really sorry. - Thank you. I appreciate it. Why dont you just get back, and I'm just gonna wait here for the bus. No, I dont want to be there. When I saw you leave, I used it as an excuse to get out. - Is there anything I can do? - Come on. - Where? - Ill show you. Lets go. Right. Dad used to bring us here when we were kids. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me? Cause I want to feel something else than this. Its either that, or I go home and put my hand in the fire. Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm. No. I only have a few left. Ive been saving them for later. Right. Itll have to be sex then. Right. Right. I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today. - Just stay there. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. It doesnt seem so long ago that I looked at you from here. Hey, go be with your mom. I'm too tired. I'm too tired not to be with you. Well, so if you had a bit more energy, wed stay split up? But things being as they are, with you being wiped out and all, you wanna get back together? - Is that it? - Yeah. What about Ian? Well, Rays a disaster. Look... I, I know its not very romantic, Rob. But there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure. I-- - I just-- - So thats it? Well, youve made it clear you want me back, so-- Look, um, we can talk about it later if-if you want to. Right now, I-- I just-- Right now, I just want to go home with you. Okay. So, yeah. And so we got back together, and it was great. She moved all her stuff back in, all at once. - So when exactly did you decide to get back with me exactly? - I'm not telling you. - See, thats not-- not a nice way to play at all. Thats not-- - The better you look - We went out to dinner every night. - The more I want you What else? - When you turn on your smile - We stayed in and made love all the time. - I feel my heart go wild - We talked about the future. - important stuff. issues. - I'm like a child with - A brand new toy - How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye? Thats like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians. No, its not like saying that at all actually, Rob. Marvin Gaye and Art Garfunkel make pop records. Made. Made. Marvin Gayes dead. His father shot him. You could say it was everything I ever wanted really. - Marvin Gaye! - I know. ""Lets Get It On."" Thats our song! Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship. Oh, is that so? Id like a word with him then. It was everything I ever wanted... except for some fuckin reason... this-- Excuse me. Is this Stereolab? Yeah. Yeah, it is. I havent heard this one. Its really good. Yeah, I know. - Are you Bob? - Rob. Oh, right. Yeah, Rob. You used to deejay. I used to go to the Doubledoor to hear you spin. You were unbelievable. - Really? - I'm Caroline. Hi. - What do you do? - I work for the Reader. I write a music column. Youre Caroline Fortis? I read your column. - Its great. You really know what youre talking about. - Thanks. - Rob, phone. - Can you take a message? Its your girlfriend. Excuse me. Hey. Hey, what the fuck is this? - Talk to your woman. - It was her idea. Crumbsbusted Pass the popcorn as I kick-- Laura! ""Dance music for old people""? Its an idea I had when I was with, um, Ian... and I thought it was such a good one that I was really annoyed we werent together any more. - It may be why I came back. - A record release party? What if I was doing something that cant be cancelled? - Rob, what are you ever doing that cant be cancelled? - Thats not the point! - The single cannot be done in time. I mean, theres a million things! - Itll be done. Oh, guess what. Barry said his band will play a set. Barry is playing at this thing? Fucking, what are you-- Are you insane? - Barry, Ill give-- Ill give you ten percent of the door if you dont play. - No! Rob, were getting that anyway. - Twenty. Twenty percent. - No! Come on, Rob. We need the gig. A hundred and ten percent. Thats how much it means to me not to hear you play. - Rob, were called Sonic Death Monkey. - Sonic Death Monkey? Yeah. And if Laura and her bourgeois lawyer friends cant handle it, fuck them. Letem riot. Were Sonic fucking Death Monkey. Let me get this straight. We made the CD with you. Now your friends and your girlfriend are throwing some kind of celebration party or something... and youre asking us not to come to the party? Exactly. I dont know, dude. That just seems kind of stupid. Its just the whole thing is just blown way out of proportion. Its just a three-song CD. Its a single. Its just-- Its not a big deal. Its just that youre making something. You, the critic, the professional appreciator... put something new into the world... and the second one of those things gets sold to someone, youre officially a part of it. Congratulations, Rob. You know, I guess I think Ive always been a professional critic... you know, or some sort of professional appreciator or something. And I just wanted to, you know, do something new... put something new out into the world... you know, kind of really put my money where my mouth is. Yeah. Wow. I would-- You know, I would love to hear them. - Why dont I send it over to you when its, uh, done? - Really? - I will look forward to that. - I will look forward to sending it. - You know, we should get back to the interview. - Sure, yeah. Okay. What are your all-time top five favorite records? In a club or at home? Listen. Ill tell you what. Why dont I just make you a tape? Now, the making of a good compilation tape is a very subtle art. Many dos and donts. First of all, youre using someone elses poetry to express how you feel. This is a delicate thing. So, for this one, I'm thinking-- I'm thinking-- When is this gonna stop? Whens what gonna stop? Uh, nothin. Whos the tape for? Just some girl who interviewed me for the Reader. So what am I gonna do now? Just keep jumping from rock to rock... for the rest of my life until there arent any rocks left? Should I bolt every time I get that feeling in my gut when I meet someone new? Ive been thinking with my gut since I was years old... and, frankly speaking, Ive come to the conclusion that my guts have shit for brains. Hi. A drinking lunch on a school day. Thats a nice surprise. - Are you nervous about tomorrow night? - Not really, no. Well, um, are you gonna talk to me, or shall I get my paper out? - No, no, I'm gonna talk to you. - Great. What are you gonna talk to me about? Um, Im gonna talk to you about whether or not... you want to get married to me. - Im serious. - Yes, I know. Well, thanks a fucking bunch. Im sorry, but two days ago you were making tapes... - for that girl from The Reader. - Yeah. Well, forgive me if I dont think of you as the worlds safest bet. Would you marry me if I was? - What brought all this on? - I dont know. - Im just sick of thinking about it all the time. - About what? This stuff. Love and settling down and marriage, you know? I want to think about something else. I changed my mind. Thats the most romantic thing Ive ever heard. - I do. I will. - Just shut up, please. Im trying to explain, okay? That other girl, or other women, whatever-- I mean, I was thinking that theyre just fantasies. You know? And they always seem really great... because theres never any problems. And if there are, theyre cute problems like... you know, we bought each other the same Christmas present... or she wants to go see a movie that Ive already seen, you know? And then I come home, and you and I have real problems... and you dont even want to see the movie I want to see, period. - Theres no lingerie and-- - I have lingerie. Yes, you do. You have great lingerie, but you also have the cotton underwear... thats been washed a thousand times, and its hanging on the thing and-- A-And they have it too. Its just I dont have to see it because its not in the fantasy. Do you understand? I'm tired of the fantasy... because it doesnt really exist. And there are never really any surprises, and it never really-- - Delivers? - Delivers. Right. And I'm tired of it. And Im tired of everything else, for that matter. But I dont ever seem to get tired of you. So-- I think I know what you mean. But were you really expecting me to say yes? I dont know. I didnt think about it really. I thought asking was the important part. Well, youve asked. Thank you. - All right! - Uh, thanks for coming out here tonight. That was just a little bit of ""I Sold My Moms Wheelchair..."" the title track from the album of same name... the record were having this record release party for. The two burgeoning criminals behind this opus are standing by the bar. Theyre underage, and well lose our liquor license-- But well get to them in a moment. First, I have to introduce a band, so please dont leave... until after they finish and we play the record. Right now, its my great, great pleasure... to introduce Sonic Death Monkey. Im an idiot. I shouldve played the whole album first. - These people are gonna burn the place down. - No, no, its gonna be fine. Its gonna be fine. These people are ready for anything. - Its gonna be fine. Watch. - Thank you. Youre too kind. Rob, thank you for the enthusiastic intro... but were no longer called Sonic Death Monkey. Uh, were on the verge of being called, uh, Kathleen Turner Overdrive. However, this evening we will be Barry Jive... and the Uptown Five. The making of a great compilation tape... like breaking up, is hard to do and takes ages longer than it might seem. You gotta kick it off with a killer to grab attention. Then you gotta take it up a notch, but you dont want to blow your wad. So then you gotta cool it off a notch. There are a lot of rules. Anyway, Ive started to make a tape... in my head for Laura. Full of stuff shed like. Full of stuff thatd make her happy. For the first time, I can sort of see how thats done."
8,2011,The Thing,American,"In 1982, an alien spacecraft is discovered beneath the Antarctic ice by a team from a Norwegian research base: Edvard (Trond Espen Seim), Jonas (Kristofer Hivju), Olav (Jan Gunnar Røise), Karl (Carsten Bjørnlund), Juliette (Kim Bubbs), Lars (Jørgen Langhelle), Henrik (Jo Adrian Haavind), Colin (Jonathan Lloyd Walker), and Peder (Stig Henrik Hoff). Columbia University paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is recruited by Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) and his assistant Adam Finch (Eric Christian Olsen) to investigate the discovery.
They travel to the Norwegian base, Thule Station, located in Antarctica near U.S. Outpost 31, in a helicopter manned by Carter (Joel Edgerton), Derek (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), and Griggs (Paul Braunstein). After viewing the spacecraft, Kate, Sander, and Adam are told the group also discovered an alien body from the crash, buried in the ice nearby. In the afternoon the body is brought to the base in a block of ice.
That evening, while the team celebrates their find, Derek sees the alien burst from the ice and escape the building. The team searches for the creature and discovers that it killed Lars's dog. Olav and Henrik find the alien, which then grabs and engulfs Henrik. The rest of the group arrive and set fire to the creature, killing it. An autopsy of the scorched alien corpse reveals that its cells were consuming and imitating Henrik's own.
Derek, Carter, Griggs and a sick Olav take the helicopter to seek help. Kate discovers bloody dental fillings near a blood-soaked shower. She runs outside to flag down the helicopter after it takes off. When it attempts to land, Griggs transforms into the Thing and attacks Olav, causing the helicopter to spin out of control and crash in the mountains. When Kate returns to the shower, she finds the blood is gone.
The team decides to send a party to the closest base, but Kate confronts them with her theory that the Thing can imitate them and has likely already done so. They dismiss her claims, but Juliette says she saw Colin leaving the showers. When Juliette and Kate look for the vehicle keys to prevent the others from leaving, Juliette transforms and tries to attack Kate. As Kate flees, she runs past Karl, who is impaled by the unkillable creature. Lars arrives with a flamethrower and burns the creature just as it assimilates Karl. At nightfall, they burn the remains of the Juliette-Thing and Karl's body.
That night, Edvard, Kate and Lars find Carter and Derek stumbling into base, half frozen. The team refuses to believe that they could have survived the crash. Kate has them isolated until a test can be prepared to verify they are human. Adam and Sander had started to work on a test, but the lab is set on fire in the few minutes it's left unattended. Kate proposes another test, believing that the Thing cannot imitate inorganic material. She inspects everyone and singles out those without amalgam dental fillings: Sander, Edvard, Adam, and Colin, while herself, Peder, Jonas and Lars are proven human.
Lars and Jonas go to retrieve Carter and Derek for testing, and discover they have broken out. As Lars searches a nearby building, he is suddenly pulled inside. The group hears Carter and Derek breaking into the building and rushes to intercept them. In the middle of a standoff, Edvard orders Peder to burn them. Before he can, Derek shoots Peder dead in self-defense with Lars' gun, but also punctures the flamethrower's fuel tank, setting off an explosion that knocks Edvard unconscious.
When brought to the rec room, Edvard transforms and infects Jonas and kills Derek before assimilating Adam. Kate torches the infected Jonas and Derek's body before she and Carter pursue the Thing. While the pair searches, Sander is ambushed by the Thing and Colin hides in the radio room and isn't seen again. They get separated and the Thing, into which Edvard and Adam are now fused, corners Carter in the kitchen, but Kate burns it before it can kill him. They then see an infected Sander drive off into the blizzard and pursue him in the remaining snowcat. While they are pursuing Sander, Kate notices that Carter is wearing his gold earring, reassuring her that he is still human at this point.
They arrive at the spacecraft, where it suddenly activates and its engines begin to melt the ice over it. Kate falls into the ship and is separated from Carter. Kate discovers the source of the radio transmission at the beginning of the film, in the form of a giant glowing cylinder with strange geometric blocks forming and shifting apart, the signal still broadcasting. Confronted by Sander, who has transformed into a larger creature, Kate destroys it with a thermite grenade and the explosion deactivates the ship, shutting down its engines. Kate and Carter escape the ship and Carter suggests driving to a Soviet base about fifty miles away, saying that they'd stashed enough fuel in their snowcat to be just able to cover that distance.
As Kate and Carter return to their vehicle, Kate notices that Carter is missing his earring and becomes suspicious. She tells him that she knew he was human earlier because he was still wearing the earring, implying she suspects he may have been assimilated while they were separated in the alien ship. Upon hearing this, Carter realizes that the earring is missing and points to his ear while attempting to explain its disappearance and reassure Kate. When Carter points to the wrong ear, Kate realizes he must have been assimilated and proceeds to burn him. She then retreats to Sander's snowcat and stares blankly as the screen fades black.
As the final credits roll, a helicopter pilot, Matias, arrives by morning at the now destroyed Norwegian outpost. He shouts, looking for any survivors. Colin is shown to have committed suicide in the radio room using a straight razor to slash both his arms and throat to ensure the Thing could never get to him. Matias sees the charred remains of the Adam/Edvard-Thing in the snow.
Lars, now revealed to be alive and uninfected, orders Matias at gunpoint to show his dental fillings to prove that he is a human. The Thing, having taken the form of Lars' deceased dog, runs out of the camp. Lars realizes it's the Thing and orders Matias to start the helicopter. As the dog flees, the two chase it in the Norwegian helicopter, with Matias piloting and Lars leaning out of the open doorway, trying to shoot it with a scoped rifle, thus leading into the events of the 1982 film.",8.2,tt0084787,"Your move: Bishop to knight four. My move: Knight to rook three. Poor baby, you're startin' to lose it, aren't ya? Your move: King to rook one. My move: Rook to knight six. Checkmate. Checkmate. You cheatin' bitch. Childs, what's he doin'? Circlin' the camp. Who is he? - Said Norge or something on the side. - That's Norwegian. - George, are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Yeah. What's goin' on down there? Watch it! Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Yes. First goddamn week of winter. Oh, come on. Four stitches. Barely grazed ya. What were they doing flying that low, - shooting at a dog, at us? - Hmm, stir-crazy, cabin fever, who knows? U.S. Number 31, calling McMurdo. Come in, over. U.S. Number 31, calling McMurdo, urgent! Come in, over. Great. - Come on, come on. - Nobody! Nobody. Get ahold of somebody. Get ahold of anybody! We gotta report this mess! Look, I haven't been able to reach shit in two weeks! I doubt if anybody's talked to anybody on this entire continent, and you want me to reach somebody! Maybe we at war with Norway. I was wondering when El Capitan was gonna get a chance to use his popgun. - How long they been stationed there? - It says here only eight weeks. - That's not long enough for guys to go bonkers. - Bullshit, Bwana. Five minutes is enough to put a man over down here. - Damn straight. - I mean, look at Palmer. He been the way he is since the first day. - How many in their party? - They started with ten. - There'd be eight others left. - How do we know? Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us. - Nothing we can do. - Oh, yes there is. I want to go up. - In this weather? - Bennings? - Winds are gonna let up a tad next couple of hours. - A tad? Can't condone it much myself, but it is a short haul. An hour there, an hour back. - Shit, Doc, I'll give you the lift. No problem. - Forget it, Palmer. Thanks for thinkin' about it though. Loaded with kerosene. I count cans. - MacReady! - Mac, get your gear on. - It may not clear up for a week, and we're the closest to 'em. - It's all right by me, Doc. - I'm just letting you know we're taking a chance. - Quit griping, MacReady. If we get caught in a white-out, you can scratch one doctor and one pilot. This is real thin. It'll clear as soon as you get up. It's up to you, Mac. If you don't wanna fly, we don't fly. - You really wanna save those crazy Swedes, huh? - Norwegians. - Which way, Doc? - Southwest. You have to read the map 'cause I'm gonna be busy. Mac's really taking it up, huh? He knows what he's doing. Nauls, will you turn that crap down? I'm trying to get some sleep. I was shot today. - Oui, Bwana. Will do. - ? Very superstitious? ? Writing's on the wall? ? Very superstitious? Anybody there? Hey, Sweden? They're not Swedish, Mac, they're Norwegian. Mac! My God! What the hell happened here? Come on, Doc. Portable video unit. - Anything? - It's all in Norwegian. - What are ya doin', Doc? - It could be important work. I wanna take it back with us. It's gettin' late. Let's hurry it up. I'll check out the last few rooms. Hey, Copper, come here! Maybe they found a fossil, the remains of some animal buried in the ice, - and they chopped it out. - But where is it? Look at this. What is that? Is that a man in there or something? Whatever it is, they burned it up in a hurry. Help me find a shovel, Doc. - We found this. - Jesus Christ! Blair, I'd like you to start an autopsy right away. - Did you reach anybody yet? - Reach anybody? We're a thousand miles from nowhere, man, and it's gonna get a hell of a lot worse before it gets any better! Well, stick to it, Windows, stick to it. Nothin' wrong with this Norwegian, physiologically anyway. - No drugs, no alcohol, nothin'. - Hmm. Well, what we got here is what appears to be, anyway, a normal set of internal organs. Heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, intestines. Seem to be normal. ...one, door number two and door number three. I think that Dawn Screen here has got the most to trade in. I went to you first. You brought your friend, Anna. You've been consulting Anna all through the show. - You may as well consult her one more time. - I know how this one ends. Clark, will you put this mutt with the others where it belongs? Yeah, okay. Go ahead. Go ahead. What are you waiting for? I don't know what the hell's in there. - It's weird and pissed off, whatever it is. - Bennings, go get Childs. What is this? What's goin' on? - Hey, Palmer, what is this? - I don't know. Childs! Mac wants the flamethrower! - Mac wants the what? - That's what he said! - Now, move! - Damn it! - Stand back. - Mac, what is it? No! No! God! - Don't! Don't! No! - Get back! Get back! Get your ass over here! Burn it! Damn it, Childs, torch it! Oh, my God. Oh! Ohh! Look. Son of a bitch. What we're talking about here is an organism... that imitates other life-forms, and it imitates them perfectly. When this thing attacked our dogs, it tried to digest 'em, absorb them. And in the process shape its own cells to imitate them. This, for instance. That's not dog. It's imitation. We got to it before it had time to finish. Finish what? Finish imitating these dogs. Easy. Easy. Good. Easy. Easy. - Clark? - Yeah? Did you notice anything strange about the dog, anything at all? Strange? No. What was the dog doing in the rec room? I don't know. He was just wandering around camp all day. Are you sayin' to me the dog wasn't put in the kennel until last night? - Right. - How long were you alone with that dog? I don't know, an hour, hour and a half maybe. What the hell you lookin' at me like that for? - I don't know. - What? I don't know. It's probably nothin'. It's nothin' at all. How much more of this crap is there? - Oh, nine hours I'd say. - We can't learn anything from this. Guess not. Where'd they take these shots? Seems like they were spending a lot of their time... in a little place northeast of their camp about five or six miles. What's that? It looks like something buried under the ice. And look at that, they're planting thermite charges. Whatever it was, it was bigger than the block of ice you found. Here. This is it, the place where they were spending most of their time. - Pretty nasty out. knots. - Screw it. I'm gonna go up anyway. Half a mile due east. Jesus! How long you figure this has been in the ice? Well, the backscatter effect's been bringin' things up... from way down around here for a long time. I'd say... I'd say the ice it's buried in... is 100,000 years old at least. - And those Norwegians blew it up. - Yeah. I don't know. Thousands of years ago it crashes and this thing... gets thrown out or crawls out and it ends up freezing in the ice. - I just cannot believe any of this voodoo bullshit. - Childs, happens all the time, man. They're fallin' out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it. Right, Mac? - Do you believe any of this voodoo bullshit, Blair? - Childs? Childs, Chariots Of The Gods, man. They practically own South America. I mean, they taught the Incas everything they know. So, come on now, MacReady. The Norwegians get ahold of this... - and they dig it up out of the ice. - Yes, Garry, they dig it up, they cart it back, it gets thawed out, wakes up, probably not in the best of moods. - I don't know... - Which one of you disrespectful men... been tossin' his dirty drawers in the kitchen trash can, huh? From now on, I want my kitchen clean, all right? Germ free! Now, how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice? - And how can it look like a dog? - I don't know how. 'Cause it's different than us, see. 'Cause it's from outer space. What do you want from me? Ask him. You buy any of this, Blair? Mac, we're movin' those things out of the lab into the storeroom. Can you come get your stuff? Be there in a minute, Doc. Through the door. Right over there. Right over there. Sorry, Mac. You have to move your stuff... Doc says we gotta stash 'em in here and lock 'em up. - I have to talk to you. - I'm tired of talking, Fuchs. I just want to get up to my shack and get drunk. - Mac, it's important. - What is it? - Outside. - It's below outside. In the Thiokol. Please, Mac. We ought to just burn these things. Can't burn the find of the century. That's gonna win somebody the Nobel Prize. You got the keys? Get 'em from Garry. I want to get some stuff out of here. There's something wrong with Blair. He's locked in his room and won't answer the door. - I took one of his notebooks from the lab. Listen. - Yeah? ""It could have imitated a million life-forms on a million planets. It could change into any one of them at any time. - Now it wants life-forms on Earth..."" - It's gettin' cold, - and I haven't slept in two days. - Wait a minute, Mac. ""It needs to be alone and in close proximity with the life-form to be absorbed. - The chameleon strikes in the dark."" - Is Blair cracking up? Damn it, MacReady. ""There's still cellular activity in these burned remains. They're not dead yet."" Let's go, Bennings. I gotta get some sleep. Holy shit. Go get the doc. - I'll get Garry. We'll meet in Blair's room. - All right. It's Bennings! Bennings was right there, Mac! I swear it had ahold of him! - Windows, get back! Keep away from him! - Don't touch him! Get back! Stay back! It isn't Bennings! - My God! What was happening to him? - If it had time to finish, it would have looked and sounded and acted just like Bennings! - I don't know what you're saying. - That was one of those things, trying to imitate him, Garry. - Come on. - MacReady, I've known Bennings for ten years. He's my friend. We gotta burn the rest of them. All right, step back. You sure that's all of 'em? We cleaned out the storehouse, the lab. There is nothing left. Where's Blair? I can't find Blair. Where's everybody else? Windows is in the radio room still trying to get through. Everyone else is in the rec room. You go on. I'll be in in a minute. Blair? Blair? Don't come in here! I got a gun! I got an ax! Don't, you son of a bitch! Don't come in here! You understand me? - He's got a gun, Mac! - Anybody interferes, I'll kill 'im! Jesus! He smashed up some of the chopper pretty good. Childs, go see if he got to the tractor. Nobody gets in and out of here! Nobody! You guys think I'm crazy! Well, that's fine! Most of ya don't know what's going on around here! But I'm damn well sure some of you do! Christ! He got most of the chopper and the tractor, and he's killed the rest of the dogs. Garry, wait a minute! Wait a minute! All right, Childs, go around to the map room door. - Talk to him. - Okay. Go on. Norris, get a table from the lab. Do you think that thing wanted to be an animal? No dogs make it a thousand miles through the cold. No, you don't understand! That thing wanted to be us! A cell gets out, it could imitate everything on the face of the earth! - And nothing could stop it! - Okay, Blair. Come on now, you don't want to hurt anybody. I'll kill you! Good shot, MacReady. Excuse me. - All right, bring him up. Lift him up. - Yeah. Okay. Okay. Come on, Blair. - What about your shack, MacReady? - I don't want him in my shack. We'll lock him in the toolshed. Why am I in here? For your own protection, Blair... and ours. How you doin', old boy? I don't know who to trust. I know what you mean, Blair. Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Tell you what? Why don't you just trust in the Lord? Watch Clark. What? I said, ""Watch Clark."" And watch him close, do you hear me? Now the radio's gone. - So are the choppers. - We're completely cut off. All we can do now is hole up 'til spring and wait for the rescue team. No, we don't wait. Somebody in this camp ain't what he appears. Right now that may be one or two of us. By spring it could be all of us. So how do we know who's human? If I was an imitation... a perfect imitation... how would you know if it was really me? Is there some kind of test, Doc? Well, yeah... possibly. - I've been thinking about a blood serum test. - What's that? We could take a sample of each person's blood. We could mix it with uncontaminated blood. I suppose if there's a reaction, we'd know who isn't human. We've got whole blood in storage. Here, start working on it. Keep an eye on Clark. He was close to that dog. Yeah. Yeah. Mac, we need Blair's help. He's the only one... - who knows what this organism is capable of. - He's too far gone, Fuchs. But get the rest of his notebooks and start going through them. Garry! Hey, you guys, come here! What? - Somebody got to the blood! - What? - Where's Clark? - Right here. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Was this broken into? No, the lock is undamaged. - Somebody opened it, closed it, then locked it. - Great. Who's got access to it? I guess I'm the only one. And I got the only key. Would that test have worked, Doc? - Oh, I think so, yes. - Somebody else sure as hell thought so. Well, who else could have used that key? Nobody! I just give it to Copper whenever he needs it! - Could anybody have gotten it from you, Doc? - I don't see how. As soon as I'm finished, I return it right away. Great. - When was the last time you used it? - A day or so ago. I suppose somebody could have lifted it off me... Oh, come on! That key ring is always hooked to your belt. Accusing everybody... Stop it now! It ain't worth it! - Copper's the only one who's got any business with it. - Wait a minute! - You've been in here on several occasions! - Doc thought of the test. - That clears him? Bullshit! - Why would he take... - Shut up, man! - Windows! - Windows! Put that down. - No. - I'll put this right through your head. You guys gonna listen to Garry, let him give the orders? He could be one of those things! Windows, wait a minute. Just take it easy. Put the gun down. Put it down. - Garry, you don't want to hurt anybody. - Get back. On the floor. It's on the floor. I don't know about Copper, but I give you my word, I did not go near that blood. But I guess you'll all feel a little easier... if somebody else was in charge. Norris, I can't see anybody objecting to you. I'm sorry, fellas, but I-I-I'm not up to it. - I'll take it. - Like hell you will. It should be somebody a little more even-tempered, Childs. All right. I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack me right now. So some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to show itself. It wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to, but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won. There's a storm hitting us in six hours. We're gonna find out who's who. All right, Doc, Garry and Clark move over there away from the others. Norris, you and Childs shoot 'em up with morphine. Tie 'em down and watch 'em. - Fuchs, you start workin' on a new test. - I need Doc's help. Yeah, you don't want to drug me. Mac, I'm not a prisoner! Here, let me do it. You're gonna break the needle in my arm. No, Doc. He's doin' a real fine job. I'm gonna hide this tape when I'm finished. If none of us make it, at least there'll be some kind of record. Storm's been hitting us hard now for hours. We still have nothing to go on. One other thing. I think it rips through your clothes when it takes you over. Windows found some shredded long johns, but the name tag was missing. They could be anybody's. Nobody... Nobody trusts anybody now. And we're all very tired. Nobody trusts anybody now. There's nothing else I can do. Just wait. R.J. MacReady, helicopter pilot, U.S. Outpost Number 31. You come up with anything yet? One or two ideas. But, MacReady, I've been thinking. If a small particle of this thing is enough to take over an entire organism, then everyone should prepare their own meals. I suggest we only eat out of cans. All right. Who's that? Anybody see Fuchs? Somebody blew out a fuse in the lab. Lights were out for an hour. Any one of us could have gotten to him. All right, we gotta find him. Nauls, why don't you come with me and we'll look outside. Palmer, you and Windows check the inside. I ain't goin' with Windows. I ain't goin' with him. I'll go with Childs. - Hey, fuck you, Palmer! - I ain't goin' with you! - Who says I want you goin' with me? - All right, cut the bullshit! Windows, you come with us. Norris, you stay here. Any of them move, you fry 'em. You hear anything at all, you cut loose on the sirens. We all meet back here in minutes, regardless! And everybody watch whoever you're with, real close. Hey, Blair! Blair, have you seen Fuchs? I don't want to stay out here anymore. I want to come back inside. Funny things. I hear funny things out here. - Have you come across Fuchs? - It ain't Fuchs. It ain't Fuchs. I'm not gonna harm anybody, and there's nothing wrong with me. And if there was, I'm all better now. I'd like to come back inside. You got my promise. We'll see. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute, man. I want to come back inside. Don't you understand? I'm all right. I'm much better. I won't harm anybody. You gotta let me come back inside. Hold it! Is it Fuchs? Yeah. Why would it burn him? Flare. Maybe he tried to burn it. Maybe he burned himself... before it could get to him. Great! Now what are we gonna do? You go inside. Tell the others we found Fuchs. We'll be in as soon as we can. - Where are we goin'? - Up to my shack. - What the hell for? - 'Cause when I left, I turned the lights off. How long have they been out there? Forty, forty-five minutes. We better start closing off the outside doors. Hey! All of you come here! Open up! Open up this door! Open up! Open up! Close that door. Where's MacReady? - I cut him loose of the line up by his shack. - Cut him loose? Yeah. We were up checkin' around his place. I found this. Look. It was stashed in his own oil furnace. Wind must have dislodged it, but I don't think he saw me find it. I made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back. I cut him loose. - MacReady? - He's one of them. - When did it get to him? - I don't know. It could have been anytime, anywhere. - If it did get to him. - Look, Childs, come on! - When the lights went out! - That would have been the perfect time. Right! You said guys were missing. And, Windows, where were you? Palmer, I told you to shut the fuck up! Where were you when the lights when out? That's what it wants: To pit us against each other! Guys! It's MacReady. Shh! - Let's open it. - Hell no! - Do you think he's changed into one of those things? - He's had plenty of time. - Nothing human could have made it back here without a guideline. - Let's open it now! - Why are you so damn anxious to let him in here? - 'Cause it's so close! - May be our best chance to blow it away! - No! - Just let him freeze to death outside. - What if we're wrong about him? Why, then we're wrong! Supply window! All right, all right. We got no choice now! Damn it! He's got the keys! What's goin' on? The towline snapped. That's bullshit, Childs. He knows damn well I cut it. You're a dead man, MacReady! Or a dead whatever the hell you are! Anyone messes with me and the whole camp goes. Come on, Childs, burn me. Put those torches on the floor and back off. Back off. Way off. - You asshole. - You'd have done the same thing. Don't argue with him. Where's the rest? So help me, I mean it! It's cool, MacReady. It's cool, man! Come on! Yeah, yeah, man. Just relax. Anybody touches me, and we go. He's not breathin'! Go untie the doc. Get him in here. And bring the others. From now on, nobody gets out of my sight. Lay him there. So you sweethearts... were about to have yourselves a little lynching party, huh? I might just have to put an end to you on general principles, Nauls. Did it occur to the jury that anybody could have stuck some of my clothes up the furnace? We ain't buyin' that. Quit that bickering over there! Windows, wheel that defibrillator over here! Put some gel on those paddles! You're gonna have to sleep sometime, MacReady. I'm a real light sleeper, Childs. If anyone tries to wake me... Uh-uh. Clear! - Clear! - Clear. - We're on fire, MacReady! - Get back! Just wait! - We're on fire! - Just wait! All right, go! Windows! Windows, get in here! You gotta be fuckin' kidding. - What do you got in mind, MacReady? - A little test. Windows, you and Palmer tie everybody down real tight. - What for? - For your health. Let's rush him! He's not gonna blow us all up! No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let's do what Mac says. I mean, he wasted Norris pretty quick, didn't he? That's close enough, Clark. - He ain't tyin' me up. - Then I'll have to kill you. Then kill me. I mean it. I guess you do. - This is bullshit, Mac! - Finish it, Palmer. They're dead, Mac! - Windows? - Yo? You tie up Palmer over here. We're gonna draw a little bit of everybody's blood. 'Cause we're gonna find out who's the thing. Watching Norris in there gave me the idea that... maybe every part of him was a whole. Every little piece was an individual animal... with a built-in desire to protect its own life. You see, when a man bleeds, it's just tissue. But blood from one of you things won't obey when it's attacked. It'll try and survive; crawl away from a hot needle, say. Now you. That's good. All right, move back. Over there. I guess you're okay. All right, put that on and watch them. Now I'll show you what I already know. That's a crock of shit. Let's try the Doc and Clark. Now Clark. Then Clark was human, huh? Which makes you a murderer, don't it? Palmer now. This is pure nonsense. It doesn't prove a thing. I thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one that could have got to that blood. We'll do you last. Get away from me! MacReady, burn it! What is it? Get him, get him! Just shoot! MacReady, shoot! - Get it, Mac! - Get it! Windows! Blast him! Get me outta here! Windows! Damn! Get me outta here! MacReady! - Get in here! - Quick, come on! Hurry up! It's coming back! Burn it! Burn it, for God's sake! - Burn it! Burn it! - Hurry up, MacReady! Let's do it. Get me outta here! Cut me loose! Cut me the hell... Come on, get me outta here! Come on, get me outta here! Cut me loose, damn it! I know you gentlemen have been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend the rest of this winter... tied to this fucking couch! Childs... we're goin' out to give Blair the test. If he tries to make it back and we're not with him, burn him. Mac, the door is open. How'd he get out? The door was bolted from the outside. Blair? Hey, Blair! You down there? We got something for ya! Blair's been busy out here all by himself. - What is it? - Something he's been making. It's a ship of some kind. He stole the parts from the helicopter. Smart s.o.b. He put it together piece by piece. Where was he tryin' to go? Anyplace but here. Hey, you guys, come here. Come here. I think I saw Childs outside the main entrance of the camp. - What's he doing outside? - I don't know. Got a flare? He got back inside and blew the generator. In six hours, it'll be below in here. Well, that's suicide! Not for that thing. It wants to freeze now. It's got no way outta here. It just wants to go to sleep until the rescue team finds it. What can we do? What can we do? Whether we make it or not, we can't let that thing freeze again. Maybe we'll just warm things up a little around here. We're not gettin' outta here alive... but neither is that thing. Generator room. Generator's gone. Any way we can fix it? It's gone, MacReady. All right. We gotta bring this whole place right down into the ice. Garry, plant yours in the old storage room. Nauls, down by the generator. Oh, God. How's it comin' in there? I said, ""How's it..."" Yeah, fuck you too! You the only one who made it? Not the only one. Did you kill it? Where were you, Childs? Thought I saw Blair. I went out after him... and got lost in the storm. Fires got the temperature up all over the camp. Won't last long though. Neither will we. How will we make it? Maybe we shouldn't. If you're worried about me... If we've got any surprises for each other, I don't think we're in much shape to do anything about it. Well... what do we do? Why don't we just... wait here for a little while, see what happens. Yeah."
9,2003,House of Sand and Fog,American,"Abandoned by her husband, recovering drug addict Kathy Nicolo, living alone in a small house near the San Francisco Bay Area, ignores eviction notices erroneously sent to her for nonpayment of business taxes. Assuming the misunderstanding was cleared up months ago, she is surprised when Sheriff's Deputy Lester Burdon arrives to forcibly evict her. Telling Kathy that her home is to be auctioned off, Burdon feels sympathy for her, helps her move out and advises her to seek legal assistance to regain her house.
A former Imperial Iranian Army Colonel Massoud Amir Behrani who fled his homeland with his family, now lives in the Bay Area working multiple menial jobs. Living beyond his means, he maintains the façade of a respectable businessman so as not to shame his wife Nadereh, son Esmail, and daughter Soraya.
Seeing the auction of Kathy's house in the newspaper, he buys it for a quarter of its actual value, intending to improve and sell the house. Meanwhile, Kathy is evicted from the motel she is staying in. Having nowhere else to go, she spends the night in her car outside her home. The next morning Kathy is angered to see her house being renovated and confronts the workers, injuring her foot. Nadereh and Esmail treat her wound, but her jealousy at seeing how the Behranis have settled in only makes her more determined to get her house back.
Taking Lester's advice, Kathy finds an attorney who assures her that because of the county's mistake, they will return Massoud's money and the house will be restored to her. Massoud, having already spent money on improving the house, is unwilling to accept anything less than the much higher appraised value of the property, which the county refuses to pay. Informed that her only option is to sue the county, Kathy instead tries to convince Massoud to sell back the house for what he paid by telling him she and her brother inherited it from their father. Massoud refuses and angrily forces Kathy back into her car.
Desperate for help, Kathy seeks out Lester and seduces him into abandoning his wife and children and becoming her protector. Using a pseudonym, Lester confronts Massoud and threatens to have him deported if he refuses to sell the house back to the county. Massoud reports this to the police and identifies Lester from a photo, resulting in a reprimand by internal affairs, and gives Kathy a furious warning to back off and leave him and his family alone. Now aware that Lester is in trouble, Kathy calls her brother Frank, but cannot bring herself to admit that she is homeless, and he is unable to help her.
Despondent, Kathy first considers driving to the house and burning it, but after becoming drunk attempts suicide in the driveway with Lester's sidearm instead. Massoud finds her in her car drunkenly unable to discharge the gun, and brings her inside. Kathy again tries to kill herself with pills, but Nadereh saves her by inducing her to vomit. As she and her husband carry Kathy to the bedroom, Lester breaks into the house, retrieves his sidearm, sees Kathy unconscious, and locks the Behranis in their own bathroom, refusing to let them out until Massoud agrees to relinquish the house. Massoud eventually offers to sell the house back to the county for the price he paid and will give Kathy the money in exchange for her putting the house in his name. Lester agrees to take Massoud and Esmail to the county office to finalize the transaction, and Kathy reluctantly goes along with the plan.
Outside the office, Lester begins to manhandle Massoud and Esmail seizes Lester's gun and aims it at him. Massoud grabs hold of Lester and screams for help, drawing the attention of nearby police officers who misinterpret the situation and shoot Esmail. Massoud is arrested but is released after Lester confesses and is incarcerated.
Massoud rushes to the hospital and while he is there he prays, begging God to save his son and vowing to make whatever changes he needs to in his life. But he finds his son did not survive. Distraught and grief-stricken, Massoud goes home and, believing they have nothing left to live for, kills Nadereh by lacing her tea with pills. He then dons his old military uniform, tapes a plastic dust cover over his head, and asphyxiates himself while clutching his wife's hand. Kathy eventually discovers the couple and frantically attempts to resuscitate Massoud but she is too late. As the bodies of Massoud and Nadereh are taken away by paramedics, a policeman asks Kathy if the house is hers. After a long pause, she quietly replies, ""No, it's not my house.""",7.5,tt0315983,"Are you Kathy Nicolo? Yeah. ls this your house? Nadi of course agreed that it was a wonderful idea... to cut down the trees at our home on the Caspian. To have the sea spread before us. To reach infinity with our eyes. To see forever. But then, our life went the way of the trees... when the Ayatollahs ripped the soul out of our beautiful country. Well, enough. Today is not a day for the old. lt is a day for the young. To the future. To our Soraya. May she be a happy wife as she is a bride. And perhaps she will not forget her poor mother and father so soon... and return to us and give to us many little grandbabies. A father can dream. He's so tanned. Retirement has been good for the Colonel. He's not retired. He works for Boeing. He doesn't work for Boeing. My son works for Boeing. Who knows what he does now. -Hello. -Kathy? -What time is it? -It's 9:00. Mom, that's 6:00 a.m. here. l don't think 6.:00 a.m. will kill you. Your father got up at 4.:30 every day of his life, God bless his soul. So how is it going? How is the program? Fine. l'm fine. One day at a time, right? l just hope it's working. How is everyone there? Frankie's good. Salesman of the month again. You know your brother. His Lisa 's in her seventh month. How's your better half? Fine. He's right here. He's sleeping. Sleeping? Mom, l'm really tired. l'm gonna go, okay? Listen, l almost forgot. Your Aunt Frances won a trip to Reno. And we'll come out on the 18th. l thought we'd stop by to see you. -The 18th? -Yeah. Two weeks. Yeah, okay. Nick's gonna be away on business, though. -Again? -Yeah. l'm gonna go, okay, Mom? Listen, you're still not smoking, right? -Bye. -'Cause, you know, they say-- Just a second. You Kathy Lazaro? Yeah. Why? Due to the nonpayment of business taxes associated with this property... the county has petitioned the court on its behalf to reclaim these costs. This should come as no surprise to you. l'm sure you've had ample warning. We've sent many notices. Now the house is up for auction starting tomorrow morning. Auction? What are you talking about? Are you out of your mind? There's no smoking in my house. Hey, Chuck. Because l see your number right here. Are we going to meet down there? lt's supposed to be a hot one today. l'd dress lightly if l were you. That's okay, because l'm not leaving. l'm afraid you have no choice, Mrs. Lazaro. All of your things will be auctioned off with the property. Do you want that? Look, you can't evict me. l never owed a fucking business tax. lt doesn't make any sense. Okay. Well, this is where l get off. Deputy Sheriff Burdon will assist you with vacating the property. Do you have a lawyer? l can't afford a lawyer. l'm a house cleaner. This is the number for the Legal Assistance Office. They might be able to help. Nothing's written in blood. You just have to clear out today. You might be moving back in next week. ln the meantime... maybe you can call some friends or family, stay with them. There's no one to call. l tell you what. l know some movers that owe me a favor. Brian. Why don't you go down to Safeway and get some boxes. Let's help this lady pack up. Lester. May l help you? My car is parked here. You asked yesterday also. -What happened to you? -l fell. -Again? -Yeah. Wash up. Do not get blood on the floor. The house was repossessed for tax payment delinquency. lt's got three bedrooms, one bath. A widow's walk would increase the value of the property. What is this ''widow's walk''? lt's a deck on top of the house, so you can see the ocean. We still got some time here. Feel free to take a look around. You should have a brown hat on your head, not a blue one. Why are you not working today? Nadereh... today God has kissed our eyes. Do you remember our bungalow on the Caspian? How l ordered the trees cut down on the west side... so that we may view the sea? Please, be quiet. Do you remember how the General brought his family there for New Year... how beautiful it was? What is the matter for you today? l today have bought for us another bungalow. l have purchased this home for a price of which no one would believe. lt is worth two, maybe three times that. We will live in this home for a short while... and then sell it and find one even better. l did not come to America to live like an Arab. A family roaming the street like gypsies. l came to the States just to live normally. Perhaps you did not come here to live like a gypsy. But l did not come here to work like an Arab. To be treated like an Arab. For four years, we have lived a life which we could not afford... and spent almost everything to marry Soraya with a good family. This apartment alone has cost us over 140,000 in rent. And what of Esmail's university education? Soon we will have nothing. Then you will see what it is like to walk in the shoes of the gypsies. So beginning tomorrow, you will begin packing. There's no more to discuss, Mrs. Behrani. Do not open your lips. 500? They evicted you from your house for that? You got it. Are you staying with friends? Yeah, l'm with a friend. How much is this going to cost me? lt's on a sliding scale. How come you didn't do something about this earlier? l did. l went to the courthouse months ago. l signed a statement saying that l never owed a business tax because... l never owned a business. l even had it certified. And what about the follow-up mail? l didn't open it. lt's very important to me that l get my house back by the 18th. l'm expecting company. When did you sign that letter? l don't know. March? l hate to be the bearer of bad news... but evidently the county's already sold your house. What? No. They can't do that. The auction date has been set for months. Look, don't worry. l'll demand they rescind the sale... or we'll file a lawsuit against the county. We'll get your house back. Before the 18th, right? lt's possible. Fuck. Hello? Sorry. l didn't mean to scare you. Don't do that. You all right? Yeah, l'm fine. You? Good. You working undercover or something? Excuse me? No, l'm off. l just.... l drive by this way... and figured l'd check in on you. See how you're holding up. They already sold your house? Technically, it's mine and my brother's. My dad left it to us when he died. l haven't told my family. My lawyer is trying to get them to rescind it. So, l'm trying not to harp on the negative. You have any kids, Mr. Burdon? Two. Call me Lester. My husband left me eight months ago. No one knows that either. Do you mind if l give you some professional advice? No. Do it all through your lawyer, Kathy. l wouldn't even drive past that house till the keys were back in my hand. Thanks for checking in on me. Sure. Night. Kathy, wait. Listen, this is my direct number at the department. Most the time, l'm out on patrol, but if you ever need anything... anything at all, just leave a message. See you. Good night. lt is like our garden in lsfahan. Hello? Yeah? Your credit card didn't go through. That's two days now. God, l'm really sorry about that. Look, l'm gonna get my paycheck on Friday. ls there any way we can just let it slide until then? The only affordable way to put a terrace up there... is to put the stairs on the outside. lt will have to block that kitchen window. l could do that for about 1,000. lf we have to go through the roof, you're talking 4,000 to 7,000. But this window must be obstructed? l don't see any other way. That is acceptable. Can you start today? What are you doing? Excuse me? What the fuck are you doing? This is my house. Who are you? This is my house. Who said you could do this? -Are you Mrs. Behrani? -No. Mr. Behrani hired us. You're gonna have to talk to him. Fuck. Shit. Damn. Stay right there. Don't move. Oh, man. Let's get her inside. Here. Come on. Careful. Can we use your bathroom? She stepped on a nail. Sorry, ma'am. Could we use your washroom to clean her foot? lt is okay. For one moment, please. -Here you go. -Thanks. Have you had a tetanus shot lately? l'm going to be sick. ls she bleeding? Excuse me. l don't want to ruin your towel. Here. l use this for skateboarding. Don't worry. l washed it. Okay? This is of course our family pictures. Thank you. l think l should go. What happened? l'll tell you what happened. My yard is a construction site. l'll tell you what happened. My yard is a construction site. -You were there? -Yeah, l was there. l was at my house. l stepped on some nails. l was bleeding on my own doorstep, waiting for a stranger to open my door. You can't just go over there. You gotta let us handle this. l want them out of my house. They're already more at home there than l ever was. Did you get their name? Bahroony? Behmini, something like that. l don't know. They're Middle Eastern. -Gary? -Yes, Connie? Type up a letter to the courier service and make sure it gets to a Mr. Behrmini. lt's damn hard to sell a house nowadays. This is what you call a real buyer's market. Sorry, but she comes in at 174,000. -You're late, Behrani. -l'm not late. l have come to tell you that l am no longer to return to this job. You tell the office, Colonel? No. So why tell me, man? ls this you? ''...inform you that under these circumstances....'' ''...we request that you vacate the property immediately.'' Mother whores. God damn it. Mr. Barmeeeny is here. Mr. Barmeeny. My name is Behrani. Col. Massoud Amir Behrani. l wish to speak with Mr. Walsh, please. l'm Connie Walsh. This is my office, Colonel. Please come in. l'm sure our letter came as a shock to you. The situation is this: Pacific County has made a number of mistakes. First, they levied a tax on my client which she did not owe. Second, they evicted her for nonpayment. And third, they auctioned the property... and unfortunately, sir, this is where you come in. But l now own the house. l paid for it in cash. l have a bill of sale. Here, please. Would you be willing to sell the county back the house? l can assure you they would make it as comfortable a transaction as possible. Please listen to me very carefully, Miss Walsh. The only comfortable transaction possible... is if the county tax office paid to me 174,000. Mr. Behrani, you only paid a quarter of that amount. The market can already pay me this. Good morning, Miss Walsh. Wait, please? From a legal standpoint, you are in the right. But the true owner of this house is living in a motel, Mr. Behrani. All her belongings are locked in storage. Now, why should she wait to get back into her home... that was wrongfully taken from her just because you want to turn a profit? Things are not as they appear. lt is a matter of necessity for me and my family. l'm sorry. l do not have a choice in this matter. This is a surprise. Good one or a bad one? lt's good. What happened to your foot? l stopped by my house, and they were doing some construction on the roof. l stepped on some nails. Thanks for letting me ride along today, Mr. Burdon. So, how's the El Rancho? l'm not there anymore. l'm staying at the Bonneville now. l don't know it. You're looking at it. l haven't had a drink in three years, Lester. l'm sorry. l should have asked, l didn't know. lt's okay. The fog's coming in. l'd like to ask you a personal question if l could. Okay. Just get it over with. Why is your husband no longer with you? l wanted kids. He didn't want kids. But l guess if he really wanted me, he would have wanted them, too. l think he's a fool. Maybe we should find you a place to stay. Do you remember the beauty of the Caspian Sea, Esmail? The water like glass, the beach sand like gold. lt is beautiful here. Massoud, when must we move again? Not too soon. Perhaps once we get a buyer, we will tell them to wait until autumn. Would you prefer that? l will do as you wish. There was this little runt of a guy. Kept beating up his wife. Except she wouldn't press charges. We'd show up and they'd be, at the door, like Romeo and Juliet. Arm in arm. She had welts and bruises all over her. So, one night, we get called out there again. And l slip down their hallway, and stuff two eight balls in his closet. Turned out he was on parole. He goes back to jail. She's safe. And l slept like a baby. Did l just lose you? No. l'm sorry. To tell you the truth, l think the wine is distracting me. -l'll send it back. -No, it's fine. -You sure? -Yeah. See, when l think of my sobriety, l don't think about wine. Alcohol was never a problem. You're a grown woman. Cheers. -What are your kids' names? -Nate and Bethany. Nate is four. Bethany is nine. Where is your house? Millbrae. ln a housing development... called Palomino Meadows. You have to drive through it to get to the mall. Yeah, l know where that is. God, l've probably driven by it a dozen times. l've probably even seen your wife. Carol. Yeah, Carol. What's your situation, Les? l married my best friend. And for seven of the last nine years... l haven't wanted to give her more than a hug or a peck on the cheek. That's my situation. What about her? lt's not the same for her. Do you want to come inside? We are blessed. What time is it? -lt's 10:00. -Oh, God. l should have been home hours ago. l'm sure Carol called the department. And l'm sure they asked her if l was feeling any better. Things are finally in motion. l'm finally going to get it over with. lt? Telling her the truth about how l feel. How do you feel? l feel found. Well, Kathy, bad news. The county's done their part... but the new owner won't go along with the deal. He's asking for four times what he bought it for. We can sue the county, but that'll take months. Do you mean that l can't legally get my house back? lt would have been a lot easier if you'd just opened your mail. You can't expect the law to work miracles. l don't expect miracles. l expect you to do your fucking job. l don't know what l'm doing sitting here talking to you. And as you see, very excellent rooms. lt is cool inside, even during the day. And from the widow's walk, sunsets are quite beautiful. There is very little fog in this area. When would the house be available? Not until autumn at the earliest. We would need some time to find a new home. That might work for us. Yes, she has come for a tool her boyfriend carpenter may have left behind. l have been expecting her. One moment, please. l am happy you came. Please, this way. l will show you. My family knows nothing of this. l'd like for it to remain so. l think you have me confused with someone else. No, l'm quite certain l know who you are. l'm Kathy Nicolo. l know my lawyer talked to you, Mr. Bahroony... but l thought we could meet face to face. My name is Behrani. Colonel Behrani. Colonel Behrani, l'm sorry. Look, my father left us this house. He left it to me and my brother and-- Tell these things to the bureaucrats at the county tax office. They made the mistake, not l. They said they'd give your money back, and l know you've put that deck on. l'm sure they'd repay you for that. l'm sorry, miss, but l have nothing more to say to anyone. Why should l be penalized for their incompetence? You should sue them for enough money to buy homes. l'll sell you this house for the right price. That's all l require. l do not know where he left his hammers. There is nothing more to say of it. Let go of me. You can't expect to just move in here and make money off of this. This is my house. l lived here, and you stole this house from me, you son of a bitch. This is a stolen house! He's trying to sell you a stolen house! What did you tell your kids? l told them the truth. My old man walked out on us. l swore l would never do that to my own. What happened? My lawyer couldn't get the house back, so l went to see the owner. -And he put his hand on you? -lt's okay. -Don't worry about it. -That's not right. He's got no right to do that. Who is this guy? His name's Behrani. He's a Colonel. Behrani? What country is he from? l don't know. But his wife hardly speaks any English. Maybe they haven't been here that long. Maybe they don't know their way around. -What are you doing? -l'm going to pay him a visit. Officers tend to listen to other officers. lt's worth a shot. What if he doesn't listen? Then l'll make him listen. Little bird. Welcome to our new home. Does it go down the hill? lt is an investment property, Soraya. You remember, like our second home on the Caspian. lt's an investment home. Let us go to the roof porch for the view. Jesus, look at them. What are they celebrating? Stealing a woman's house? Fuck these people. You're a very wise man, Genab Sarhang... to live in such a place that gives you a view of God's wonders. Did you post that sign, sir? Yes, is there a difficulty, Officer? And that's your sign at the bottom of the hill? Yes. Please come in, Officer. l am new to the area. ls a permit required to post signs? Not on the house. But the utility pole, that's city property. l see. Very well. l'll put the sign elsewhere. Thank you for informing me. You're a long way from home, aren't you? This is my home. l am an American citizen. -Were you a General? -l was a Colonel. Tell me, Officer, what more can l do for you this evening? What's your name? Massoud Amir Behrani. And the names of your family? Why do you need the names of my family? What is your name, Officer? Deputy Sheriff Joe Gonzalez. Now let me ask you a question, Colonel. Are you selling this house on your own? l do not wish to offend, Officer... but if you'd excuse me, l have work to do this evening. Civil Code . Yes, you have informed me. l suggest you come with me to witness the removal of the sign. No, l'm talking about the disclosure law, Colonel. You, the owner, have the obligation to tell all prospective buyers... anything about the property they have a right to know. l do not understand. You sure about that? Are you interrogating me, Mr. Gonzalez? No, you tell me. l understand your friend, the Shah, made a real habit of it. l don't know who you think you're speaking to, but l've had enough. You've done your job. You may leave. You're used to giving orders, aren't you? Let me get right to the point here. Pacific County has offered you money. They don't want any trouble. The only one that seems to want trouble around here is you. You don't want to do the right thing, which is to sell this house back... at the price you paid for it, so it can be returned to the real owner. The real owner, Mr. Behrani. Now that just won't wash. l have more than one contact at lmmigration. People get deported every single day. There are a lot of things l can do. l suggest you call the movers so l won't have to. What happened? Well, the guy's obviously not right off the boat. l think you're right. He probably buys up seized property just to make a killing. l set him straight. l think he'll listen. He will. So what do we do now? Look at us. We're both homeless. My friend has a cabin a few miles south. We can stay there. Give to me answer, Behrani. What did that man say of deporting? -He said nothing, Nadi. -Do not lie to me! l heard him ! Who was that man? Tell to me, Behrani. Behman behgoo, what have you done? lt's none of your business what l have done or not done. Have you no faith in me? No respect? That man only said l must remove the sign. That's all. Coward! Liar! You kasifliar! lt is your fault we were forced to flee from lran. lt is your fault that we are here! Yours and your Savak friends! How long can we stay here? Till we get things figured out. You hungry? l could eat. Do you still love her? Look, it's just.... lt's not her. She's a good person, a good mother. Would this have happened anyway? Even if you hadn't met me? Yes. l miss my dad. He worked really hard for that house. lt took him... thirty years to pay it off. And it took me eight months to fuck it up. We're going to get your house back. Soon. When this is all done, l promise... l'll move you back in myself. My son... do not follow the example of your father one day when you are married. Do not do as l did last evening. Do not be disrespectful, son. Look at me. -Were you a Savaki? -No. l only bought fighter planes for Shah-ansha. Why did that man say we will be deported? l do not know. But we are American citizens. We own this house. They can do nothing to us now. l feel bad for that lady, Baba jahn. The woman's house was taken from her because she did not pay her taxes. That happens when one is not responsible. Do you understand? Do not feel bad. Americans, they do not deserve what they have. They have the eyes of children, who are forever looking... for the next source of distraction, entertainment, sweet taste in the mouth. We are not like them. We know rich opportunities when we see it and don't throw away God's blessing. You know l must raise money for your university education. l can get another paper route. l know. You are kind child. Quickly becoming a man. You have my respect for your heart. Soon all this will be over. Thank you. Have a good day at work. You need to see what you're doing to this family. Look at your children, at the damage you're causing. -This is not the time for this, Carol. -When is the time? When l'm not on my way to work. Stop it! Do you want to get arrested? ls that what you want? You want to arrest me? God, go ahead, arrest me in front of our children. Daddy, please! God, l didn't mean to do this. Don't go. Please don't go. We checked, and we have no Joe Gonzalez on the force. Did he have anything else on him? Any pins, anything that might help us to lD him? We have hundreds of deputies in the department. He wore a golden star. A badge with two pistol barrels crossed. And letters of gold spelling F-T-O. There are only eight Field Training Officers in the whole department. Tell me if you see him here. Yes. That is him. That is the man who threatened me. lt's Burdon. You're completely confident this is the officer? l'm sorry this happened to you, sir. l can promise you it won't happen again. What do you think? l cleaned the whole place. What's wrong? Kath, l need to go home for a while today. l need to go home and explain things to Carol better... to Nate and Bethany. l should be home when they come back from school. You just said ''home'' three times. lt is my home. At least until we make another one. Are you coming back? A couple of hours. Three at the most. l'll understand if you don't. l don't deserve you. Of course you do. Fuck. l told the kids that this was just temporary... that you were just taking some time off, like a vacation. l didn't know what else to tell them. Tell them the truth, Carol. Hello. Deputy Lester Burdon? Hello? -Deputy Lester Burdon? -Yes? This is Lt. Alvarez with lnternal Affairs. l'd like you to dispatch yourself to my office immediately. Can't it wait till l'm back on duty, sir? No, Deputy, it cannot. You be in my office in minutes... or you can come in tomorrow and drop off your badge. Please wait. Excuse for me, please. l am sorry for keeping you to waiting. How is your foot? Better, thank you. Can l come in? -Please, come in. -Thank you. l grew up in this house. lt's the house that my father left to me and my brother when he died. The county evicted me from this house by mistake. And your husband bought it... and now he won't sell it back for less than four times what he paid. Now, l don't want to argue with him. You know, l really don't. lt's just that if this goes to court, it could take months, and-- They are to deport us? -l don't know. -You must see. They will kill us. They will shoot my children. You don't understand a word l'm saying, do you? Please, you are a very nice girl. Please, you write for me everything. l want for to understand... for discussing with my husband. You think you can frighten me? You think you can frighten me with your stupid deputy coming here, telling lies. What do you think l am? Tell me that. Am l stupid? Do you think l'm stupid? ln my country, you'd not be worthy to raise your eyes to me. You are nothing! And you can tell your deputy friend his superior officers know everything. You tell him that. This is our home! -Please. -Our home! Please, stop! -K, is that you? -Yeah. Mom said you sounded strange on the phone. What's going on? l need help. -l really need some help. -What's wrong? Do you think you could just come out here? Please? K, l'm sorry. l just got a real shit storm going on over here. We just got the new models in. There's inventory. l'll be right there. Just give me a second. l just feel lost, Frankie, you know? l just.... l just feel lost. Look, Ma and the aunts will be out there on the 18th. They can help you, bring you back, straighten you out, okay? l'm sorry, K, but l got to go, okay? All right, chin up, baby sister. l'll call you later. Don't tell Mom, all right? Okay, bye. Fuck. Pack of Royals? Wild night? Seems to be heading in that direction. -Have a good one. -Thanks. This, and three on two. You need a funnel with that? No. Just a book of matches. l'm sorry. l don't want the house anymore. l don't care. Don't go. You must sleep now. You must rest. Please? Some tea. Please, have bath to relax. That car in the driveway, is it that woman's? The woman has come here and tried to take her own life. We must help her. Pesaram, she is a bird. A broken one. Your grandfather used to say that a bird which flies into your house is an angel. You must look upon his presence as a blessing. We have a guest in the house. You must be a gentleman, joon-am. Very kind. Very polite. Very quiet. Hello? Do you need anything? Your mouth to open. Very good. Your mouth. Very good. Yes. Very good. l feel sorry for her. We should have moved. Yes, perhaps you're right. We should have moved. Put her down! What did you do to her? Step back. Shut up! -Listen! -No! Move! Les, don't. Move. What did you do to her? She took an entire bottle of my mother's pills. Bring them to me. How many? When? English! My wife says tablets, perhaps half an hour ago. My wife made her lose her stomach. She has vomited the pills. She also attempted to shoot herself with that pistol. l discovered her with it in her automobile. She was quite upset. She'd been drinking great deal. That's bullshit. Come here. Pick her up. Carry her into that room. Carefully! Step away. She'll be okay. All right, come on. l don't want to see this door move. Get some rest in there... 'cause tomorrow you're selling this place back to the county. Fuck. Yes? -l have to go. -Use the toilet. Your mother will not look. Today l want you to pretend to be frightened of this man. -You must do everything he says. -Why? He is a weak man, he is nothing without his gun. He's very scared, and a scared man is dangerous. We will remain... lions in our hearts, pesaram. -You're here. -l'm here. Sir? Please let us out so my family can eat. -What's going on? -l locked them in the bathroom. Why? That's crazy, Les. No, what's crazy is trying to kill yourself. Kathy, why? l didn't think you were coming back. Well, l'm back. Do you really want to die? l just wanted things to change. You will get out when you call the goddamn county! Sir, may l speak with you? What? Please open the door. l wish to speak with you directly. l think l have a possible resolution. You and l will go to the government office... and l will sign the necessary papers for returning the house to them. They to me will write a check for 45,000. This check l will give to you and the woman... in exchange for putting the house in my name. -You would do that? -l would do that. Wait. We can't do this, Les. l think that this can all work out. He signs the house to the county. When he gets the check, he gives it to us. Then you sign the house back to him. lt's wrong. lt's just wrong to do it this way. This has got to work. This way, at least you get some money. He gets what he wants, the house. lt's a win-win situation. No one gets hurt. Let's just go. Please, let's just go. Kathy, we could use that money. To start new. lt's our only choice now. He'll never let it happen. All right. Leave the keys and go do what you promised. But your son stays here with me.

When we get in there, you and lshmael here... You listen to me. When we get in there, you and lshmael here... you'll have to hear me a whole lot better. You're gonna do exactly as l tell. Help! Somebody help us! Somebody call the police, fast! My name is Esmail... not lshmael. Help, somebody call the police! Esmail, please! Drop it, now! l said drop it! Wait! No!

We can give you a police escort! l want only my son. Emergency! l must see my son. My son, he is here. -He has been shot. -His name? What's his name, sir? Behrani. Esmail. He's in Trauma. You can wait in the lounge. Please, God, don't take my joon-am. l make my nazr. My nazr, hear me, please to hear me. l will give everything to one who is less fortunate.

Some tea. l am tired. Soon we will return to the flowers of lsfahan... the mosques of Qom... and to the fine hotels of old Tehran. l have taken us so far off our course... but now it is time to return. lt is time for us to go home... to our destiny. God. No. Please. Are you Kathy Nicolo? Yeah. ls this your house? No, it's not my house."
10,2009,"The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard",American,"Ben Selleck's car dealership, in Temecula, California, is failing and he is forced to hire a mercenary, Don Ready. They have 211 cars to sell over the 4th of July weekend. Don's team of Babs, Jibby, and Brent promise Ben that they will make the dealership a profit after the weekend.
On the first day the crowds gather outside for hot dogs and other gimmicks. Don notices that the naturally talented salesman, Blake, could be his son (he was in the town before and had a brief fling while there). The sales team sells the cars by any means necessary and finish the day selling 71 cars. Before they can leave the lot Stu and his son Paxton from the opposing dealership offer to purchase the lot. Since Paxton is marrying Ben's daughter, Ivy, he is trying to put his future father-in-law out of business. Paxton only wants practice space for his ""man-band"", Big Ups, and eventually wants to take them worldwide. Ben is about to finalize a deal with Stu but Don promises to sell every car on the lot.
The second day starts off poorly with a dishonest commercial that Ben is dying of testicular cancer. When it is time for Eric Bice, Bo Bice's brother to take the stage he backs out at the last minute and Don takes the stage. The crowd riots when they find out Don is an atrocious singer. Taking advantage of all the cameras on the lot from the riot, the team starts a sale for 20% off to the police.
Don is taking stock in his life when Ivy questions him about one of his jobs in Albuquerque. Don tells her that he killed his best friend and team DJ, McDermott (played in a flashback by Will Ferrell), by giving him a bag with sex toys instead of a parachute. Don was more focused on having sex with his customer than selling cars. He then reveals to Ivy that he is falling for her and it is all happening again. That night Ivy comes to Don's hotel room and they have sex.
Ivy reveals that it was a one-night stand and is not breaking up with Paxton. Don is furious and storms out yelling that he only trusts cars after what he's been done by Ivy. The team searches but cannot find Don, they get pumped up to sell the 105 cars left on the lot without him. While wandering the desert Don sees the deceased McDermott with two angels. McDermott tells Don that everything is about the team, people you love, and that he should get off the road and settle down. In the time it takes Don to get back to the dealership the team sells every car on the lot.
Don parachutes onto the lot but Stu and Paxton inform him the ""bandit car"" (an expensive prop that was used in the Smokey and the Bandit films) is not sold and the dealership is theirs. Don convinces Paxton to buy the bandit car, which saves the lot, and Paxton leaves Ivy to tour with his band. Don announces that he is going to get off the road so he can care for his friends and family more. Don marries Ivy and adopts Blake (despite the fact that Blake knows he is not, in fact, Don's son) but they get divorced two years later.",5.7,tt1092633,"She's a real beauty, huh? Yep, a real beaut. This car is for you. Now, let me guess. The man of the house needs a second car so the little lady can go to the garden club while he plays gin rummy with the boys, huh? Actually, we need a car so we can go rock climbing. Rock climbing? Why would anybody go climb a rock? Man, things are changing. I remember when men were men and women were gals and we'd call coloreds, coloreds. You know, actually, I think we're gonna get going. Hey, come on, sweetie, don't be a bitch. Let's talk some numbers here. Hey, hey, hey, don't talk to my wife like that. Hey, boy, I fought in the big war. I mean, nobody tells me what to do. You understand? Hold this. - Oh, my God. - Audie Murphy, motherfucker. Somebody get Dick Lewiston off the lot. What's it matter anyways, Mr. Selleck? No one's selling anything. - It's a damn killing field out there. - Mr. Selleck, I think I made a sale. - Terrific. Good job, Teddy. - And he wants to pay in cash, non-sequential unmarked bills neatly packed in this canvas bag. Well, that's a bank bag, Teddy. My eyes. My eyes. My LASIK. - Shit. Somebody call the cops. - It burns! - Teddy, go flush your eyes out. - I feel like a Smurf just jizzed in my face. We got to do something. I've had this lot years, and it's dying right before my eyes. We either do something drastic, or we pull the plug. I'm thinking about calling a hotshot, a weekend warrior. I was thinking about calling a mercenary. What? - A mercenary? - Hell, Zooha, I got no choice. The bank's crawling up my ass for back payments. If we don't turn this thing around by August, - this place is gonna be a TCBY. - But a mercenary? All they do is sell cars and move on. There's no connection to the community, Ben. Don't do this. It hasn't gotten that bad, has it? Please, God, forgive me for what I'm about to do. - By the way, great sale. - Hear, hear. Very good. Thank you, darling. I don't know why, but I can't enjoy breakfast anywhere but a strip club. My mom used to always cook bacon naked. She would cook bacon all day long. Don ""The Goods"" Ready. Yes. Yeah. You want some cars sold. We'll be there. Fourth of July weekend, three-day sale. We got a dealership in the ICU. Two hundred and eleven cars getting suntans on the lot. Guess what, fellas? We're going to Temecula. Fuck, Don. Honey, we just finished the last job three hours ago. I still smell like customer. Don, I don't mean to complain, but it's been a year and a half since I've been home. And I'm 90 sure I left my front door open. I don't know, Don. I think we sit this one out. You've been pushing us pretty hard since 'Querque. Forget about 'Querque, all right? What do we do? We sell cars. What does a tiger do? Hunts and kills prey. What else are we gonna do in this life? I need every swinging dick in that field. Babs, come on. Let's do it. All right. We are headed to Temecula, California. Population 98,000. It's a family business. Owner, one Benjamin K. Selleck. Married years to wife, Tammy. One daughter, lvy, age 29, looks good in beat-up jeans. Yes, she does. One son named Peter, age 10, loves robot dinosaurs and pizza night. Looks like 10-year-old Peter got a five o'clock shadow. Yeah, it must be the fax ink. God bless the Hacienda Court, but their fax service... - What are you doing, honey? - Enjoying myself. Sir, there's no smoking on airplanes. I know. It's ridiculous, isn't it? Don't worry about it, I'll be quick. Sir, if you light that, I'll have to report you to the FAA. Stacey, do you know when the first commercial flight went smokeless? - No. - 1973. And did you know that in 1969, when smoking was allowed on all flights, - we put a man on the moon? - I had no idea. Look. You know what that is? That's a remnant of a better time, but they welded it shut. And it starts with ashtrays, and it ends with all of our precious freedoms being stripped away. I remember back in the day when you got on a plane and you knew you were in for a good time. - A little smoking, a little drinking. - Yeah. And the stewardesses. Stacey, you come from a proud tradition of blazing hot stewardesses. And now you can't do one damn thing without someone reporting you to the Department of Homeland Security. - Am I right? - That's right. - You listen to Don. - I had to take my pants off and nibble my Old Spice down to three ounces just to get on the plane, Stacey. They made me throw out my mouthwash. I had to give up my bath jellies. They made me breastfeed some old man. That's what I'm talking about. But we don't have to take it, Stacey. Like Henry David Thoreau and Rosa Parks and David Lee Roth when he left Van Halen, we can say, ""Enough. Enough injustice."" And when you and I are old and gray, we can look back on this and remember when we were 30,000 feet above God's green earth, and we smoked one, we smoked one for America. Yeah. You motherfucker. Nice work. Nice work. Who are you? I'm Don Ready, and I got the goods. This is some killer kush. Nun pops her head out and says, ""Shit. Guess I got to gargle."" Poor Don. It's like everything he does is to make him forget about 'Querque. Takes a lot of pain to sell cars the way that man does. - You're here from Selleck Motors? - No, but my dad is. You're supposed to put the name of the party you're picking up, not your own. I love the drawing, though. Yeah, I'm a really good drawer. I like to draw stomach muscles the most. I can also draw Darth Vader's helmet. I can also draw him. I can draw a saber, a lightsaber or a regular sword. It doesn't even matter. What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you drunk? Are you retarded? Because we're here to help you. Don't move. Dad, Amber Alert! Adult! Stranger danger! Stranger danger! Dad! Here, relax, Peter, okay? Take a swig. It looks like it wasn't the fax ink. He's some sort of man-child. It's a pituitary problem, ma'am. He's 10, in the developing body of an adult. I'm sorry, buddy. I am totally sorry. Put it up here. High five. Good effort there. You must be Ben. I'm Don Ready. - That's me. - And this must be lvy. Wow! Can I ask you a quick question? How much does a polar bear weigh? - No idea. - Enough to break the ice. - Don Ready. How are you? - Wow. - Went old-school with you. - Impressive. I'm Babs. And, yes, the rug matches the drapes. And this beautiful man is Jibby. - Hi. - What's up? And who is this guy? Well, you are a strapping young man. - Brent Gage, sir. - Brent Gage, now that is a strong name. I don't know why, but right off the bat, I like you a lot. What's going on? Peter, let's help the crew with their luggage. Awesome. Hold this, Dad. Transformer. Cute, isn't he? I'd fuck him. Hey, what is wrong with you, lady? He is a child. We're only gonna be here for three days, so try not to fall in love with me. I'm sorry, has a girl ever bought that? I'm just, you know, buckshot approach. I'm just gonna keep firing till I hit something. That's delightful. So, there was a kid up the street, Chris Bamberger, had one of those brand-new, tricked out Krazy Kruisers. Side brakes, streamers off the handle grips. In other words, fully loaded. What am I driving? A fucking Hoppity Hip. Basically a balloon with a handle on it. It might as well have had a bumper sticker on the back that said, ""My parents don't work."" So I walk up to him, hop up to him. I introduce myself, and I say, ""You seem like a cool guy."" ""Why don't you have a Hoppity Hip?"" You know? I tell him it's faster, it's cooler. It's got the finger-molded hand grip, double-enforced bouncing axis. I work this kid like a pro. Walked him through the brochures. Offered him a bubble gum cigarette. Even threw in some night crawlers to sweeten the deal. Bottom line is, this kid was actually happy to bounce around on the balloon, while I rode away on his brand-new, tricked-out chopper. I like to think that was my first sale. Right over there is Selleck Motors. I thought you might want to take a look. Jesus, Ben, looks like a refugee camp for dirty men. Looks like the bus station in Total Recall. We're gonna fix your place up, Ben. We're gonna get you a Creatable Inflatable, goddamn American flag, balloons, all that shit. Plus, we need a radio and TV blitz, and we're gonna need to round up a celebrity to make a lot appearance. I know just who to call. Now, let's hit the Hacienda Courts, or as I like to call it, home. I mean, I paid for it. It'd be disrespectful not to masturbate. All right, let's keep this anonymous. Don't look at me. Don't look at me. Don't even... Don't you look at me. Yeah. Dawson's Creek. James Van Der Beek, my nigger. Okay, Peter, it's time to go sit in your big chair. Now, everybody dig in. Don't be shy. I'm sorry, Mrs. Selleck. I'm one of those rare birds that prefers takeout over a home-cooked meal. Well, I got to tell you, Don, that is flat-out weird and rude. But you do what you need to do. You know, Mr. Don Ready, our lvy here actually left graduate school to come back and help us out with little Peter. - Wow. - That's the kind of girl she is. You can take the girl out of Temecula, but... Hey, Brent. ...you can't take Temecula out of the girl. You see my wife over there? Yeah. It is a dead marriage. But, you know, you learn to live with it. You drive around, out at night, windows down, music up. Some people call it cruising. Me, I call it looking for a friend. - Are you my friend, Brent? - No. So tomorrow morning, our troops will rendezvous with your troops at 0700, and then I'll hit the floor for my intro speech, like a mountain lion pouncing on an unsuspecting jogger. Make sure your underwear is tight tomorrow, because you will have a boner. Amen. I like the sound of that. Right, Brent? By Tuesday, my friend, you are back in the black. Well, hear, hear. Okay, Mr. Ready, this business has been in our family for years, so no sleazy stuff, okay? Don't worry about it, darling. We're not gonna break the rules. We're just gonna bend them a little bit. Okay, okay. I just... I know your type. You know, it's all the thrill of the hunt. I get it. I mean, you crave it. You corner it. But, Mr. Ready, let me ask you a question. Do you know what to do when you catch it? - Are we talking about pussy? - Oh, my stars. You didn't. - That's what she was saying. - Oh, my goodness! I'm sorry, I apologize. I'm a Christian man, or whatever religion dominates the region that I'm selling in, but you have to admit, it did sound like she was talking about the big vajayjay, right? - Didn't it? - Amen. I guess it kind of did. Yeah. Hey, come on, man. Jibby was a pro bowler for two years on the tour. Got a lot of great stories. Well, what can I say? It was the go-go '80s, the height of professional bowling, girls, limos, wristbands. Ivy, I think you got the wrong impression of me earlier. I'm a really sensitive person, all right? For instance, I'm not a texter. I'd rather hear your voice, you know. - Hey, everybody, I'm lvy's fiancé. - Look who's here. Paxton, such a weird thing to say when you enter a room. Well, I'm just letting everybody know the deal. Well, I am Paxton Harding of Harding lmports. And you must be the guys who are going to save Ben Selleck Motors. - Yeah. That's the idea. - I didn't catch your name, friend. That's because I didn't give it to you, friend. Well, a couple of friends ought to know each other's names, right? - My name's Don Ready. - All right. I guess I won that little exchange. You fell for it. In fact, let me be the first to tell you guys, good luck. Everyone at Harding lmports and every dealership in this town is rooting for you guys. You got a Harding guarantee on that. I swear to God. I'm off to rehearsal. All right? I want to give my two ladies a kiss on the cheek. You are so sweet. You know, Paxton here is in one of those popular bands in Temecula, Balls Out. - No, Big Ups. - Big Ups. Sorry. Either way. Big Ups is the name of the band. It's me and Ricky and Jason, and we... You know, we sing about life and love and passion, and I'm not gonna lie to you, we have some pretty sick dance moves. Are you in a boy band? No, I'm in a man band. We're all over 30, we call it a man band. You're men in a boy band. We opened for O-Town, right here in Temecula, okay? - Google it. - No. - Google it. - No. Why wouldn't you google it? I just told you to google it. - Google ""Big Ups."" - You know, I googled it. It said you fucking blow. That was O-Town's website. You know what? I'm rising above this. While you guys are yukking it up, I'm gonna go rehearse with Big Ups. Ricky and Jason are in the car. Let's go. - All right, bye-bye. - See you all tomorrow. Man, that dude is garbage. What a jerk. Who wants a big hunk of this meat? Hey, guys. A couple guys came in here earlier looking for Vanessa, and I got a little bit of bad news for you, Vanessa is dead. Here's Radio Moscow. It's funny, I haven't been in Temecula in, what, years. Last time I was here, I spent two straight days in a Hacienda Courts with the third runner-up to Miss Temecula. Never saw her again. Hey, what do you make of this Selleck guy? I got to be honest with you, have you noticed him saying overtly sexual things to me? - Touching me? - I haven't. That is disgusting. But don't get me wrong, I have an erection. Babs? Can I tell you a deep, dark secret I ain't never told anyone before? Baby, I really would rather you not. I'm tired. I'm years old, and I ain't never, ever made love to a woman. - You're a virgin? - Hell, no. No, I've been with hundreds of women, maybe thousands. I just ain't never really ever made love to a woman. You know, I've done three ways, four ways, ménage à trois, ménage cinq, six. I've 69ed, 89ed, 114ed. Golden, diamond and platinum showers. I like that. I mean, I've ripped shit up. Done all that. But I ain't never, ever made love to a woman. You will, Jibby. As long as we're being honest, I've something I want to share with you. I think I want to make love to a 10-year-old boy. What? But he's in the body of a 30-year-old man, so who's to blame? - You the adult. - Right. You'd be the one to blame. Hey, Babs. Hey, Jibby. Hey, Don, there are three hot dancers over there. I think they might be good for the sale. Yeah, sign them up. Good energy, make the customers happy. Hey, guys, get those food orders in quickly, 'cause in minutes the kitchen is rented out for a porno shoot. - Are you disgusted? I am. - Book the DJ. You sure, Don? I just thought after 'Querque... Hey. 'Querque was 'Querque. This is this. It's time for all of us to move on, all right? And it starts with booking that DJ. Where is he? I even wore my tight underwear for the boner speech. Just relax, honey. He's getting ready. As for the underwear, I think it was just an expression. Look, I may be old-fashioned, but the man says, ""Wear your boner pants,"" I wear my boner pants. You can do this. You are a winner. Don Ready has the heart of a champion. I'm a fucking stallion. I should be owned by a goddamn Middle Eastern sheikh. There's almost no doubt you invented the phrase, ""It's all good."" In the schoolyard, a Don Ready is a euphemism for a hard-on. All right, fellas, everybody gather around. Now, you all know the deal. Over the next few days, Don Ready and his team will be overseeing sales. Basically, they will be your boss for the weekend. Now, I trust them. And if you trust them, together we will sell cars. You were the first person to wear a Von Dutch trucker hat. - I really regret that. - As well you should. Look at my husband. Looks like he's got a Don Ready. Give me a minute. I'm Babs Merrick. I'm gonna tell you people a little story. A story about a girl who grew up in the worst part of the South Bronx. Well, one day, this little girl fell in love with a boxer named Winston. But their love was too good to last, and one day, the Vice Lords came a-calling, saying, ""Winston, it's time to take a dive."" Coroner found two bullets in his heart. One of them was meant for this little girl. It's a hard world, mama You got to push on through 'Cause life in the ghetto Well, everyone told this little girl to shut her mouth and go away. But she didn't do that. She made sure every single one of those pieces of human trash looked her straight in the eye before she pulled the trigger on that platinum.357 Magnum. Jose! Ramon! It ain't easy I got to tell you people, on TV, they don't show the dead man when the poop leaves the butt. Make no mistake, gentlemen, when you die, poop leaves your butt. Man. That is a dark story. I know. I made it up. Have a great sale, everybody. - What? - Great sale. It ain't easy - She made it up? - It ain't easy. I'm Brent Gage. They call me The Magician. I am a wizard with numbers. I have never, never lost a sale to bad credit. Quick story. A couple years ago, MC Hammer, remember him? He was in bankruptcy, living on the street, sleeping in the left leg of his Hammer pants. The next day, I financed that man a car, no questions asked. Hammer lived in that car for the next year and a half. So you guys are just taking over? With your cool nicknames and your confidence? I mean, how are we supposed to feel? Yeah, what about our sales? Our commissions? It's all good. I'm Don ""The Goods"" Ready. Everyone here told you their story. Here's mine. I have hair on my balls and I sell cars. The end. All right. Today, tomorrow, Monday. It's July 4th weekend, everybody, and we're going to war, all right? When you guys are deep in the shit, I want you to think about the real heroes of this Independence Day. The Revolutionary War soldier who had his gangrene foot sawed off, with nothing to numb the pain except a shot of whiskey and that guy with the weird headband playing the flute. What about Private Jones, huh? Seventeen-year-old soldier. Got his guts shot out in a 'Nam rice paddy. All right? Dick here knows what I'm talking about. He's talking about freedom, you fucking queers! Don't even get me started on Pearl Harbor. Our Navy boys out there enjoying the bright Hawaiian sun, when all of a sudden, here comes the Japs flying in low and fast. This dealership is our battlefield. Don't give up the fight. We are the Americans, and they are the enemy. Never again. Never again. Never again! - Never again! Never again! Never again! - Never again! Never again! Never again! Let's get him! Eat my shit! - Dad, don't you think you should step in? - No, he can take it. He's squirrelly. Stop! All right, stop! Everyone, calm down! Put him down, Jibby. Okay, we have all just participated in a hate crime. Was it a hate crime or a freedom crime? All right, everyone, just calm down. Bottom line, we have all just committed a federal offense. Which means that G-men are gonna be crawling all over this lot. Let's get our story straight. Dang came at us with a samurai sword, fire extinguisher, and Chinese throwing stars. - Yeah. - That seems plausible. No, I did not. No, I did not. I... We got to get a sword and get his prints on it. There was no weaponry of any kind! Okay, Dang, how about this? You get first dibs on customer ups. In return, you agree to forget all about being the victim of a hate crime. Okay. - That's it, Dang. That's the guy we love. - Thank you, Mr. Selleck. I'm really sorry. I'm not even Japanese. I'm Korean. Korean? Why didn't you say so? On that note, let's man those battle stations, everybody, all right? Never again. We got one hour. Let's get this place in shape. Really simple, boys. If you take this six, you flip it, that's the price. You know what you can do with this? You can take this and turn it into that if you want. You've taken 3,000 off this car. It's back down to your original price. - Zooha, to sell you must... - Confine, confuse, conflict. Nice! Teddy Dang, to close, you must... Lie, loan, leave. Nice. Mr. Dick Lewiston? Go fuck yourself, you bald-headed son of a bitch. - I've seen more hair on bacon. - Good enough. Wow, you must be the girls from the strip club. - Yes. Heather. - Hey, Heather. How are you? Your job is to greet people, get them in the buying mood, okay? - I have an idea. - Sure. Since it's July 4th, I thought it'd be good to talk to the customers about how this government has been cutting benefits for veterans. Let me guess, you are dancing to pay for your Masters in Political Science. - Yes. How did you know? - I don't know. Stripper stories, they usually come in three, college student, single mom, cokehead. What's your son's name? I'm kidding. I don't even know what I'm saying. I'm bananas. You guys are doing an amazing job. Sapphire, wipe your nose. God. All right, we gonna be selling some cars today. And tomorrow, you know who we got coming in? I do. American Idol's very own Bo Bice's brother is coming down. Yes. Eric Bice will be right here, rocking the stage. Hey, DJ. This place is about to pop. Why don't you throw on some Charlie Daniels? Good call. Nobody tells DJ Request what to play. Let them tell you what to play, they lose respect for you. They lose respect for you, you lose control. Not today. All right. - You want to thumb wrestle? - Yeah, I'm awesome. - You won. - I totally beat you. - What are you gonna do to me now? - What? - You better spank me or something. - Babs! He's 10. Ten and a half. Do you hear that, Ready? Ten and a half. Brent. Those are my kids. Yeah. And probably a good reason you're not selling. What are you talking about? Zooha, let's face it. You've got husky kids. I know it, you know it, and every Chuck E. Cheese in a 50-mile radius knows it. You know who doesn't need to know it? The customer. I don't understand. Look, you put up a picture of skinny kids. Customer thinks, ""Oh, my lord, this guy needs the commission. ""He's got to feed those hungry mouths."" Okay. I get it. I get it. Should I take down the picture of my wife? No, that's your closer. Fat kids, customer hates you. Fat wife, customer pities you. Shit, Zooha. That's the best fat wife I've seen in four or five years. Can I have a copy of it? Nice balloons. Wow, that line must have knocked them dead in the frat house. Come on, I'm just trying to have some fun. So, you pumped for the big day? Yeah, it should be great. They say you sell some cars. Let's see you sell some cars. No, no, I'm not talking about the sale. I'm talking about your wedding. Excited to spend the next years of your life with... - Paxton? - Paxton. BMW boy band Paxton. Seems like a super guy. Now, now. All right, what about you? You have any relationships that last longer than a lap dance? Have you seen what these girls do these days? I mean, we are living in the golden age of lap dances. - Wow, that has got to be tiring. - No. You don't want a home life? You don't want to live for somebody other than yourself? No time. I'm on the road 51.5 weeks a year, and I like myself a lot. I'm having a blast. You know what? I don't believe you. Look at them. They're like crazy boat people. I love it. Give away free hot dogs and put up an inflatable gorilla, shit's gonna go down. I feel exactly like I did before I landed on lwo Jima, I swear to God. There's no difference at all. Attaboy, Teddy. Pain is weakness leaving the body. Sell these bastard cars! Sell the metal. Sell the metal. Sell the metal. Sell the metal. Sell the metal. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Welcome to Selleck Motors. Let's get you in a car. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Welcome to Selleck Motors. - Yes, sir. Welcome to Selleck Motors. Thanks so much. What's wrong with her? What's her name? Stephanie. Hey, little Stephanie. You're amazing. What did you say to her? Shut the fuck up. Why don't we get you into one of these minivans? Zooha! - You feel it? - Yeah. I call it the divine rush. Money for cars. Salesmen putting themselves on the line. Capitalism, it's my high. I haven't seen the lot like this since I brought in the Bandit Car. You know, rumor is that that car is one of the cars that was in Smokey and the Bandit. That weekend this place was hopping. I was thinking we should get that out of here, you know. It's bad for business. No, that car is a collector's car. That's worth 200,000, won't take a cent less. But in this Auto Lister, they have the same exact car for 1,000 less. Wow. What a great deal. - Excuse me, can I see that? - Sure. My, my. If you can get this car for 1,000 less, you should definitely buy. In fact, let me call. Thank you. - Here you go. - Thanks. Hello? Hi, I'm calling about the car you have advertised. Can we get a drink? - No, I don't want to go for a drink. - Yeah, I can put you in my truck. We can drive around. You can see how it handles. - Maybe go to the reservoir. - Excuse me? I... - Put the lotion in the basket. - Who... - Put the lotion in the fucking basket. - Oh, my God. See, I try to tell women all the time. Auto Lister's like MySpace for serial killers. I don't want to see another one of these on this lot. I think I'll just take this car right over here. Okay, here's the deal, Gary. I know the stereotype. I'm a woman, got a luscious body, provocative clothes. I'm gonna use sex to sell cars. You know what's gonna sell this car? Price, nothing else. I mean, I like men. I like men a lot. I can't believe I'm doing this. Do you know what I love? I love women. Yeah? I mean, I'm talking me, an Asian chick, and a schoolteacher in a shower. - Yeah. - Get all soapy together and so wet. And you know what? Maybe like a construction lady comes in, like, you know, like I can't even tell if she's hot or not. - Okay. - But then she says, ""Looks like I could do some work here."" - And she takes off her hat. - It falls down. Sure. And then you guys come over and all three of you undress her. - Yeah. Hey, hey, guess what? - Yeah. - What? No. - I'm next door. Yeah, 'cause I'm the superintendent, and I'm working on like paperwork, like doing people's checks, I'm like... Yeah. - ""What is that noise?"" - Like, ""That's weird. ""There's not supposed to be anybody next door."" ""Hey, who's in there?"" And I just hear, ""Oh, oh."" I listen by the door for a while, then I open it up, I'm like, ""Hello?"" - I still can't see the steam. - Like, ""I'm so scared. Who is it? ""Who is that man?"" ""Hey, you're not supposed to be in here."" - Can I give you something to say? - Yeah. Say this, say, say, ""Hey, I knew something was missing in this apartment, ""a big cock."" ""I knew something was missing in this apartment, a big cock."" And we're fucking, and then someone else goes, ""Oh, yeah..."" - Fuck. I just thought of something, man. - What? How the fuck are you gonna get there? I'm right next door, remember? I'm just gonna walk over. No, man, this is miles and miles away, man. You got to get there soon! I'm, like, managing a bunch of properties? Yes! How are you... It's across town. How are you gonna get there? I don't know. I don't have a car. I gotta get a bus... No, man, you got to fucking take this car. Yes. I am gonna buy this car. It's a good car, right? - No. - I don't give a shit. I'll fucking push... Go see the dudes in the back! - Run, man! Run! - I'm gonna go buy this car. In your country, they would cut your hands off because you're stealing from us. You guys have got an amazing deal, I can't believe it. Mom! Mom! - How we doing? - Kicking ass. I was worried earlier, but we're gonna have a great day. - Check out that Blake kid. He's on fire. - Yeah, I noticed. Wasn't that your move? Well, mine ended with the two-gun salute to heaven, but it's damn close. You remember when I told you that I partied with that beauty queen years ago in Temecula? I didn't put a hat on my jimmy. Jesus, Don. You don't think Blake's your son, do you? I'll tell you what, why don't you guys go to finance - and I'll meet you there, all right? - Okay. That's impressive, Blake. You're a natural. Spend a lot of time growing up around dealerships? No, but my mom always said that I had it in my blood. I remember this one time as a kid, I traded my crappy Huffy bike to this kid down the block for his brand-new shiny Schwinn. - No shit. - No shit, Don. Hey, was your old man around a lot when you were growing up? No. He took off before I was born. I'm gonna go back to the sale, Don. - Blake, how old are you? - Twenty-two. Hey, kid. Don. Remember that guy that wanted the Explorer? Here's what I got him to do. Buy his own house from himself for 1, which means nothing, but to the bank... Don. - Hey. - What's going on? Good job. What'd I do, Don? Fuck you, I don't need your validation. Look at that number. Seventy-one cars sold. I am looking at some real salesmen out here. Good work. Yeah, we've actually sold 34 of the inventory. Wow! I'm proud of you. And, by the way, congrats, whoever pulled off a Nigerian buyback, haven't seen that in years. - That was me. You can suck it. - What's a Nigerian buyback? Guy takes a customer's trade-in, then minutes later, sells it right back to said customer at a mark-up. And we're looking at an even better day tomorrow. Bo Bice's brother coming in here to sing some tunes. Shut up. Eric Bice? The very same. So, I think we do a little celebrating. And after a hot first day, there's only one way to do it. 'Okie. - What? - What's 'okie? Tell them about it, Dick. He's talking about karaoke, you fucking queers. God damn, Dick knows what I'm talking about. - Let's go. Let's get into it. - Nice job, everybody. I've been watching you out there, girl. Your moves are probably responsible for sales. Well, any individual who pursues his or her own self interest actually promotes the interest of society as a whole. It's all trade, baby. That's what makes the world go 'round. That's funny. I always thought love made the world go 'round. See you. Love. Boy, you should be proud. You took a rag-tag bunch of losers and turned them into first-rate salesmen. That's what I do, Ben. - Hello, Ben. - Hello, Stu. Looks like you guys had a heck of a day. Hey, Paxton, Lance Bass called. He said he... Fucking forget it. Yeah, like he would have your number. Hey, Lance Bass never opened for O-Town. My boy did. You can google it. Yeah, I told them that already, Dad. They refused to google it. Well, let me cut to the chase for you here, Ben. My boy Paxton's band, Big Ups, they're really starting to click, and we're running out of rehearsal space over at Harding lmports. So Paxton had a good idea. He said why not make an offer on your lot, nice price, before the bank gets it? That way, Paxton's out front selling Beemers, then he runs around the back, makes gold records. What do you think? I don't know, Stu. We had a pretty good day here. We had an outstanding day. Don't be all humble, Ben. Come on. All right, hold it, Don. Give us a couple minutes alone, will you? - You got it, Ben. - You too, Paxton. Hey, you know, even if Ben doesn't sell, we're gonna get this place for pennies on the dollar when he goes B-rupt. Really? You're gonna screw over your future father-in-law? It's called business, Don. Okay? And besides, I would do anything to take Big Ups worldwide. So, lvy isn't enough for you? You have a crush on my fiancée. That is rich! Here's the deal, old-timer. Get over it. Here is why I'm not threatened by that at all. - A, I have a beautiful car. - Yeah. - B, I have a 44 haircut. - Right. Yeah, and C, I have slick threads. Yeah. - Men's Wearhouse. I like the way I look. - Right. I'm Temecula's newest hard-on, dog. A, it looks like you just snapped into a Slim Jim. B, your suit looks like it was... - I'm glad we could work all this out, Ben. - Work what out? Well, Don, it's time I start thinking about my future grandkids. I sold the lot to Stu. He made me a real good offer. Thank you for your support, and you'll be paid for the whole four days. But we're pulling the plug. Can we get all of their stuff out of here, pronto? We want to rehearse here tonight. Hold on. Hold on a second. What about family? What about history? What if we save this lot? What if I could guarantee you that I could sell every car off this lot? Ben, that's foolish. You don't even know this guy. Look at him. He's a gun for hire, a tramp. Don, we're talking about over cars. Sure, it'd help the lot, but that's impossible. All right. Look, either I sell every car on this lot, or I leave Temecula and get out of the game for good. - Doesn't move me at all. - And you get Brent Gage for the night. Sorry, Stu, but the deal's off, at least till I see how this thing pans out. Okay. You know, since you're almost family, Ben, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna save you a job on my lot, after the bank forecloses on yours. Damn it. Why are they standing in the way of my dreams, Daddy? Look it, here's the deal. Call your TV guy. Tell him we got to cut some new spots right away. I have a script for you, never fails. More than words Is all you have to do to make it real Wait, now, so, he offered to pay us off and we could leave town flush. And you said no. Yep. - Motherfucker. - Hey, chill, chill! Come on, man, calm down. It's Don. He wouldn't do it if he didn't have a good reason. And then I told Ben that if we don't sell all the cars that he could have Brent for the night. - Motherfucker... - All right. All right. - Jibby, handle him. - Calm down. Calm down now. All right, here's the scenario, all right? Tomorrow, I'm gonna sell an assload of cars. And I suggest you gentlemen do likewise. What the hell we gonna do? Why don't we chill a little bit, Jibs? Just chill. Okay, it's cool. Don said we got TV spots tomorrow, right? Bice is hitting town. We're gonna pull this off. I'm gonna hit you with a little Seger. Superbad, eyes up here, let's focus. This one goes out to Blake. It's about a boy, the son of a man, a mother's child. Let's get him a tissue, 'cause it's about to get raw. What the fuck is wrong with that guy? On a long and Ionesome highway East of Omaha Okay, I got to ask you a question. Does Don know what he's doing? I've seen that man say a lot of crap just to sell cars and move out of town. But this time, he really means it. Truth be told, he ain't been the same since 'Querque. - 'Querque? - The Duke City. A-Town. Captain Kirk. Albuquerque. - Who calls it Captain Kirk? - I don't know. We lost a good man down there. - He quit? - Died. - From a car sale? - Hell, yes. The rest of us come to terms. Don's still fighting it. Wow. Only Jeff Robins wasn't looking, so I pegged him in the head. - What is it? - It's really a fun juice. - Okay. - Okay. Just don't tell your dad. You know what else is really fun? Going to a motel and wrestling. I love wrestling. I can get you into a figure four leg-lock. Like this. You know, your legs'll be all tied up. Sold. - You'd be screaming. - That sounds fantastic. Okay. - Are you good at keeping secrets? - Absolutely. 'Cause I've got a present for you. Secret present outside, by the dumpster. Is it a baseball mitt? Fits you like a baseball mitt, like a glove, I hope. Is it new or is it old? It will be new for you. All right, that means I'm gonna have to break it in. - Yep. - I'm gonna have to break it in. I'm gonna have to... I'll put a ball in there, and I'll tie it off. Right. And then I'll put lotions and oil on it, and I'll sleep with it under my pillow. Yeah. That was Turn the Page by Bob Seger. I'm Don Ready. Good night. So listen, let's meet outside by the dumpster... - Hey, it's 11:30, closing time. - Oh, man. - I got to go home. - No. No. No, I got to go home, put my pajamas on, and I got to shave. I know, but, Peter, before we do this, we'll just... - We can wrestle later. - No. In fact, I'm gonna... Waitress, can we get another whiskey sour? - Just for the road, and a... - We're closed. ...paper cup, please. God damn it! Just one more drink. I'll cut off your tits with a knife, you bitch! Babs, listen, I like the energy. Let's play through. Party back at the Hacienda Courts. Everyone's welcome. No guys. If you want to go far Put yourself in a kicking car At Selleck Motors I started Selleck Motors almost years ago, and I've had a good run here at my dealership, and in life. But now I'm dying, Temecula. I got cancer of the nads. But before I die, I want to see one last big Fourth of July blowout. So, my family and I are asking you to come on down to Selleck Motors and buy one final car from us before I'm dead. Looks like the chemo is kicking in, so you better hurry. - Jesus, Ben, why didn't you tell me? - Daddy. It's just a commercial, Peter. And, Brent, my privates are fine, I swear to God. Good for you, Ben. It's gonna work, Ben. It's gonna work like gangbusters. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, if you don't like the car, then go buy a truck, cheapskates! Every day, it's a gay safari. Give me the balloon back. Piece of shit. - Thank you. We appreciate this. - I'm so sorry. If there's anything I can do... It's such a tragedy. Tammy's so brave. Hey, Don. I'm not sure this is working. I mean, people clearly care about me and all, but we're not selling cars. Stay positive, Ben. We're gonna hit this hard until 3:00. When Bice gets here, he's gonna take it over the top. Hey. Can you bring the mood up? You know, play something good? Like Y.M.C.A. by the Village People. You read my mind. Just out of curiosity, what time do you get down from there? Every day they will test you. Every day they will push you to the brink. You must fight them, DJ. Fight them. I'm gonna do something that I don't do. I'm gonna throw in some free floor mats, all right? Now hold on. Hold... - Jesus. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Don! What's going on? You know what? If you would've told me years ago that I were to hit the wall in a three-day sale in Temecula... - You're hitting the wall now? - Well, yeah. Let me ask you something. What do you think this means? - I had this dream. I was just saying... - Yo! Hey! ...you know, ""Listen, Don, you're a..."" - Ivy, let's go. We got lunch with my mom in, like, two seconds. - Be right there. - We got to hurry. She'll be drunk in about 15, so giddy-up. - Don, what happened in Albuquerque? - Nothing. Nothing happened. You kidding? It was... Listen, go have a great lunch with... With your fiancé. Time to hit the road. Hey, Don Ready, looks like you had a rough day. It's okay, sometimes it happens in the auto trade. If you suck. Hold on. You got to admit, dude, that was a good exit line. - Right? I got a better one. - Yeah. Hey, Don Ready, I'll see you in l-Don't-Know-How-To-Sell-Cars-Ville. Yeah, that one, granted, not as good, but that's 'cause I won't be in that town. Fucker. Damn it. Psych. Psych. I just psyched you out. I'm going that way, so fuck you. All right, people. We got Eric Bice, brother of Bo Bice, coming up in the next five minutes. You might want to sit in one of our cars... Hell of a turnout for Bice. This day's starting to look up, huh? We need it. We're getting killed out there today. - Don, we got problems, big problems. - What's up? - Bice isn't showing. - What? His booking agent said he's got adult chickenpox. But he gave me some other options. The mascot for the San Jose Sharks hockey team. He'll show, but he can't wear the Shark suit. What's this I'm hearing about Bice? He motherfucked us. He motherfucked us like a pro. - I'm going on. - What? - I'm going on. - No, wait, Don, be careful. I'm getting a real sketchy vibe from this crowd. Ivy, don't you see? This is everything. I get to sing, which sells more cars, which helps your family. Plus, my son gets to see the old man come through in the clutch. What son? Eric Bice! Eric Bice! Hey, everyone! I'm Don Ready. I'm a car salesman. This is gonna go well. Yeah. Now, unfortunately, Eric Bice has adult chickenpox, but I'm gonna be filling in for him. Drop it! Just take those old records off the shelf I'll sit and listen to them by myself He's no Bice! He's no Bice! Yeah, I should've said something. Don's a bad singer. I want that old time rock and roll Fuck you! Aren't you people tired of being screwed over? Then let's fucking riot! Hold up a minute! Get him! Stop it! Hey... Hello! Hey, guys! Mr. Selleck, we got to get you out of here. Come on. We got to hide, Brent. We'll be safe in my room. Hold up a minute! Hold on! I got a big show! This does not look good for you, Uncle Sam. And concussion. Don't mess with him! That kid's got retard strength! Dork! See. Who the fuck brought alligators? I never thought I'd say this, but thank God the police are here. Welcome, police. Come on, let's lock up some white people. Y'all are all retarded. Hello? This day is completely shot. Can you believe these animals? What the hell's happening to this country? What are you talking about, Dick? You started it. You remember? Cops gave you a ticket for inciting a riot. You old goat. This is horrible. Let's face it. It's over. It's not over. Over? When is the last time that there were that many cameras on this lot? We got five hours left in this day, okay? Now, I intend to sell some cars, all right? Now, get in here. Let's go over some talking points. Come on. Baby, if you are true I'll keep doing it Doing it, right there, to you Doing it Doing it Doing it Doing it to you Julio, pick up line nine. Julio, line nine. You know, look, guys, the big problem here? We need a bigger rehearsal space. Not a problem. Here's why. Huge riot down at Selleck Motors. The place is going down in flames. We're taking it over. It is the new Big Ups rehearsal space. - Are you serious? - Yeah. We're gonna... We're gonna take it over. Pardon me, boys. Some bad news from Selleck Motors. Look at this. Listen, people get excited over used cars, and, occasionally, they'll punch and burn things. Now, some call that a riot. Me? I call it excitement over the low, low prices down here at Ben Selleck Motors. The police are the real heroes. And because of that, we're offering 20 off and 0 financing to any police officer that comes down, anyone with a police hat, anyone that says the word ""police."" This Don Ready is like the rash between my balls and thigh. And if you find an alligator in your car, 500 off! Congratulations, Officer. You see that, Ben? Just like that, we're back in business. Motherfucker, I ring the bell. The reason that the Japanese outsell us is because they make more fuel-efficient vehicles while Detroit insists on pushing gas-guzzling SUVs. God damn, girl, you turning me on. Would it be improper of me to ask you out for a drink tonight? I don't know, Jibby. I've been hurt before. Well, my problem is I ain't never allowed myself to be hurt. I'm trying to be more vulnerable. Well, you're an honest man, Jibby, and honesty is the first step to being vulnerable. You can pick me up at 9:00. - Hey, Don. - Hey, Jibs. What's with the shit-eating grin? For the first time in my life, I have a chance to make love to a woman. Love. I'm glad we found the right car for you. Hey, Blake, you ready? For what? A little catch. You know, I'm starting to think that maybe lvy was right, maybe it's time for old Don Ready to settle down and plant some roots in this crazy old world. Great. I mean, I've been on the move for so long that I've never taken time to stop and to hug the people that are important in my life. And, Blake, don't ever think that you're not important. All right? Great. You ever think about your daddy? No. I mean, who wants to think about some piece of shit that gets a woman pregnant and then takes off? You know, I'm not bitter. I did fine without him. He's probably out there with no family, nothing real to hold onto. Can you imagine how meaningless life must be for a prick like that? What a douche. - Hey. - Hey. I cannot believe this riot actually helped. You are insane. You know, I'm gonna be sorry to see you go. Well, lvy, goodbyes are an occupational hazard. Okay, wow. I don't know what's going on with you. You are hot, you are cold. One minute you're happy, then you're snapping at me. I mean... What happened in Albuquerque? You don't want to know what happened in 'Querque. Actually, I do. Come on, what? You can trust me. Just let your guard down. McDermott was my best friend and the greatest car-sale DJ anyone's ever seen. Damn it, it shouldn't have gone down like that! I was all wrapped up with this woman. It wasn't gonna work. I knew that. Blah, blah, blah. I was trying to impress her. We had already sold a bunch of cars that weekend, but I wanted to take it over the top. So, I thought, hey, let's put a few bucks into it, you know? Get a good crowd in there. We'd airdrop McDermott in, dressed as Abe Lincoln. He would float in and say... I freed the slaves, now I'm gonna free those cars from the slavery of high prices! We had a bunch of great lines for him to say. Hey, just like John Wilkes Booth, our prices are gonna sneak up behind you and blow your brains out! When I asked him, he didn't even blink. He just did it. Thanks, buddy. This is the thrill of a lifetime! Drop zone! Drop zone! Me, I was on the ground with Mrs. Talero. We planned to meet in the back of a Taurus. That is so good. My husband never does that to me anymore. Oh, yes. She had me pack a bag of sexual accoutrements. Basic shit, you know, rubbers, lube, dildos. Weirder stuff. Executioners' masks, French ticklers. Yeah! Take me away! The only problem was I took the wrong bag. Fuck! Don gave me the wrong bag! I can only imagine what was going through McDermott's head as he fell to his death. Got to try to get away from this dildo! The regrets he must've had. Most people who are in this situation, their life flashes before their eyes and they go through a list of regrets! For the next seconds, I want to go through the list of things I've done right! Number one, full-length back tattoo of the Hawaiian Punch guy! 10 real fruit juice, motherfuckers! He had a huge heart, but, my God, was he stupid. Number three, had my wisdom teeth put back into my skull! Christ, the dildo's back! I'm gonna get into an aerodynamic tuck and use the dildo to cushion my fall! I killed my best friend. I wish I could say I didn't think it would end this way! But I got to tell you, I always knew it would! Falling to my death, dressed as Abe Lincoln, holding a big, purple dildo! This is how I drew it up. Next thing I know, it's raining dildos. Had I just been focused on the sale, it wouldn't have gone down like that. Now it's all happening again, with you and Blake. I'm losing who I am and my focus. You think that riot was an accident? No, no, no. It happened because I lost my focus. That was damn good Seger. And now I'm falling for you. Yeah, no, not again. I'm not gonna do that. Wait, Don, come on, don't go. I'm gonna go sell some cars, Mrs. Harding. ""Z."" Seven. - Hey, guys. - Brent. I have to say something. I think Don might think I'm his son. Now, I've met my dad. He lives in Louisiana. I just wasn't raised by him. Don's going through a lot of big changes in his life, and right now you might be the rock he's holding onto. Are you saying I should pretend to be his son? Because, Brent, that's fucked up. Is it? Or is it fucked down? Look, Don Ready would make a damn good father to you, and right now, I don't see a lot of guys lining up for the job. Think about that. And while you're at it, you think about why your dad left you. Come in here and blame Don. That's pathetic. It's about minutes on the down side of 9:00 here at Selleck Motors. I hope you're curled up with your best girl, making music together in between the sheets. Look at this. You know, everyone's gone, so you can shut it down. Thank you. Looks like that's gonna do it for me. Good night, sweet Temecula. May all your loves be tender... - Seriously! Shut it the fuck down! - Thank you. See, I don't do what I'm told. I'm what's called contrarian, all right? I hate... You gonna turn the lights off on me? Like that's gonna scare me? I don't give a fuck! I'm homeless, motherfuckers! Wow! Hey... Come on in. Shouldn't you be at home with Bell Biv DeVoe writing personalized vows or some shit? Don, I'm here. Don't make me change my mind. Yo, we're Temecula's number-one pop sensation. - Big Ups! - Big Ups! And we're gonna be kicking it live, right here at Harding Imports tomorrow, so come on down! - Congrats again on that. Yeah. - Thanks. - You want to turn it off? - He needs to see this. With lease-to-own options and a full-service garage We're gonna make love. Love. Love. Love. - Head  Shoulders? - How'd you know? My uncle uses it. We're actually making love. I'm making love. We're making love. You know what nobody ever told me about making love? - What? - How boring it is. Yeah. You can do anything you want. My safe word is ""blueberry pancakes."" Okay. Let's have sex in every corner of this room. Okay. I fucked up. I should've got a bigger room. - That's okay. - I have points and I didn't use them. Continental breakfast in bed. - Hacienda Courts style. - Wow. You know why this is the best breakfast? - Why? - Bear claws, crullers, prison-size orange juice. You know, I actually feel bad for Paxton. I didn't mean to come in and split you guys up, but engagements are made to be broken. Don, I'm not leaving Paxton. What? You don't love him. Well, now, that's not necessarily true. And, you know, I'm almost years old. I mean, what am I supposed to do, you know? I want things, and I want a family, and Paxton wants those things, too. I mean, look, nobody dreams of buying an '88 Lynx station wagon, but we sold one yesterday, right? And the people who bought it, bought it because buying a Land Rover wasn't an option for them. So, what are my options, Don? What about us? What about giving us a chance? I mean... Where, in the Hacienda Courts in Boise? Or how about the Hacienda Courts in Wichita? 'Cause if things go really well, we could raise our kids in the Hacienda Courts in Muskogee. What did you even come here for? Because I wanted one last fling. And I know you're not gonna stick around. So, you're just gonna have sex with me and then leave? This hurts! Guess this is what women mean when they say, ""So you're just gonna have sex with me and leave? This hurts."" I'm sorry. Something that I want is being taken away from me, and I don't like it! I don't like it! This is exactly how I felt after 'Querque! Screw everybody! The only thing that I trust in this world is cars! Come on, Don! Come on! - What's going on? - Don! Don's never been late for the last day of a sale. Don's gone, and you did not see me here. Okay. Well, did he go to the lot? I don't know. He kind of just freaked out and left. 'Querque all over again. Fucking 'Querque. He's gone. Looked everywhere, called the cops. No one knows where he is. I'm sorry, fellas, I apologize from all of us. No. Hold on. You guys did your best. I mean, it was an uphill battle from the beginning, right? But, hey! We still sold some cars, right? We still sold some cars! Might as well dust off the old résumé. Hey, wait just a minute. I practically built this dealership myself, and I remember a day when we wouldn't hang our heads or talk about closing the lot. A customer would walk in here and this place would pop! There you go, Ben. And having Don ""The Goods"" Ready here for three days made me remember why I became a car salesman in the first place. Mr. Selleck's right. We can do this. Don has taught us all something. He knew more about us than we knew about ourselves. Yeah. You know, I never much cared for Jews, queers or fucking Eskimos, but that's just the way I was brought up. Is that it? Yeah. That's it. I just wanted to put that out there. I thought we were opening up here! Guys. We can sell these cars. - There you go! - Ready has carried us this far. Well, I say we start carrying our own weight. So let's get out there and sell the metal! Who's with me? - We are! - We are! - I'm with you! Listen to him! - We are! We are! - We are! We are! We are! - We are! We are! We are! - We are! We are! We are! - We are! We are! We are! You don't even know this guy. Look at him. He's a gun for hire, a tramp. He's probably out there with no family, nothing real to hold onto. And I know you're not gonna stick around. James Van Der Beek, my nigger. Well, if it isn't Don goddamn fucking Ready. Holy fuck. McDermott? He has returned He is McDermott Oh, my God! I been waiting a long time to set the record straight with you, man. He's setting the record straight, motherfucker I trusted you, Don. I trusted that what we were doing was bigger than all of us. But it turns out, all you wanted to do was get your ball sack played with by some woman with bad credit. It's an age-old tale His trust was betrayed by tang Balls and wiener. They let angels out of heaven to cuss at people? Yeah, of course. That's what's going down, dipshit. Fuck you, Don Ready, fuck your family I don't get it, McDermott. Man, you used to be so easygoing and... Yeah, I was. I was easy breezy. And then, guess what? I fell out of a plane and hit the ground, and I didn't bounce. But you know what did bounce? My butthole through my face. Geronimo, splat Displaced anus I'm so sorry, McDermott. I need your help, man. I feel so empty. Don't you get it, Don? This is where all the cars we sell end up. It's not about the cars. It's about the team and finding people you love. That's it. - What do I do? - You know what to do. Get off the road, man. I mean, after 35, it just looks pathetic. While we're on the subject You're too old for a Facebook page I'm sorry, McDermott. It's okay, man. I'll see you in years. That's when you're gonna die. August 19, 2036 How am I gonna die? Choking on a sausage patty at a strip club. Is there any way they could sing it? 'Cause it sounds sad. No, it's not very lyrical, and it is sad. So, no. - A little bit? A little... - No. We talked about it in the heaven spaceship that brought us here. - We got to jump. Change your ways. - No, no. See you, Don. Oh, my God, lvy and the team, they need me. They need me right now. Need me. Thank you, McDermott! Get them out of the back lot and into the front! Let's go, let's go! I think you guys are gonna really like this car. It's a good fit. Good news. My finance guy says it's gonna work. Are you serious? Zooha! It's all Don. You understand? All of it. Retard! I love you. I've got some things I need to make right on the ground! I'm doing this for my friend McDermott! He died, and I'm jumping for him! Makes all the sense in the world! One, two, three! Jump! You got yourself a good deal there. Pop the clutch! Pop the clutch! We did it. We sold every last car on the lot. Man, I wish Don was here to see this. Hey, look, everyone! It's Superman! I want to come down right at Selleck Motors, all right? - Got it. - All right. Where are the cars? Wait a minute! Is that Don? Look out! Run! Run! Watch your head, team! Coming in hot. Hey, Jibby, where are all the cars? Don, we did it. We sold every single one of them. You're shitting me. That's fantastic! - They all stepped up. - Unbelievable. I'm proud of you guys, all of you! We couldn't have done it without you, Mr. Ready. You taught us all to stand on our own. Your time here has been rich and filled with wisdom. I don't know what to say. Why not start with the truth, Don? Well, the truth is, you sons of bitches saved Selleck Motors! Fuck you, Don Ready! You didn't sell all the cars. You lose. You're losers. What are you talking about? All the cars are gone. Lot stays with the Sellecks. Come on, Stu, a deal's a deal. We sold all the cars on the lot. Nobody sold the Bandit Car. Rules are rules. The lot's mine. The Bandit Car? Don said every car on the lot. Bandit Car's a car and it's on the lot. Hold on a second. That thing is a prop. Don, that is not a prop. That is a 200,000 automobile. This is good. Is this the great Don Ready complaining about how hard it is to sell a car? Did you hear that, everybody? Did you hear that? Maybe he's not so great. Maybe he sucks! So, I guess you lose! Ben, you lose the lot. Don, you have to skip town. Right, everybody? You know, Paxton, I been doing a lot of thinking these past few days. About what, asshole? Dreams. About how we either, you know... We either cherish them or let them die on the vine. What'd you want to be when you were a kid? Me, I wanted to be a ref in the WNBA. You know, 'cause I like women and I like basketball. Can you get off my back? - You want to do this one on your own? - Yeah, thanks, man. I get that. Okay, you guys do your thing. What'd you dream about, Paxton? Music. Music's been my passion ever since I fell in love with the classics. Now, when you say classics, what do you mean? Well, it's a pretty short list. You got your 'N Sync. You got your Degrees, your Boyz II Men. And then pretty much the Backstreet Boys came along and revolutionized music as a whole. Hello! What about O-Town? That was the best night of my life. See, I haven't had the best night of my life yet. Someday though, huh? All personal crap aside, I hear Big Ups is pretty damn good. - Come on, who said that? - People talk. - Is he doing what I think he's doing? - No way. If he moves that car, I'll eat my own pussy. Attagirl. Thirty-two years in the business and I've never seen this, a dealer-to-dealer lot sale. This is suicide. Come on, Don, stay focused. Let me ask you something, man. You ever think about just dropping everything and going for it? I'm not talking about setting up some studio in the back of a car lot. I'm talking about you, Ricky and Jason living the life, man, and putting yourselves on the line on a daily basis. Wait. What are you doing? Picture this, Paxton. Big Ups touring the Florida Panhandle, right? Gainesville, sold out. Pensacola, sold out. Right? And now it's Panama Beach. Lights go down, and all you can hear is 7,500 girls screaming at the top of their lungs, right? And the bass, it starts pumping. Pump, pump, pump, pump. The girls start jumping. Jump, jump, jump. Ricky and Jason, they hit the stage. Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance. What happens next, Paxton? I don't know. What? - An engine roars to life. - What? I mean, just fucking roars! Who rises from beneath the stage? - Who? - Jesus. The guy with the best hair in the business. - Paxton Harding! - Yeah. - In the goddamn Bandit Car... - What? ...T- top, golden eagle on the hood. And the word is, it's one of only five used in the movie. And the girls, they love it. And you want to know why? Yeah. 'Cause we're good. You're goddamn right, you're good. You, my friend, are a full-blown rock star in that car. Holy shit. He might have him. I feel like I'm watching a wonder of nature, like a blue whale giving birth or a pig going down on a hyena. You know, Paxton, a man much wiser than myself once said that most men lead lives of quiet desperation. Now, do not silence Big Ups before the girls, nay, the world, has heard the first verse. Pump, pump. Pump, pump. Pump, pump. How much for the Trans Am? grand. I'll give it to you for 80. No payments till January. I'll take it! He did it! Who just got grand for that prop, huh? - Big Ups! - Big Ups! This is the new band car! Yeah! Get it down! Hey, Brent, we would've had a wonderful weekend up at that cabin, huh? You know what? I'm gonna fucking knock you out. You already have. Basically, I have to carpe diem here, lvy. See you! Well, it's official. I am single. I'm sorry, lvy. I was just selling a car. Are you? Are you really sorry, Don? Okay, you got me, I'm not sorry. You know what? Paxton and the Bandit Car were just parked on the spot where I intend to plant some roots. - You hear that, team? - What? What, honey? Cutting up the Hacienda Court card. Yep. I'm settling in Temecula. - Don! - Yep. I've been doing a lot of thinking about friends and family, and I decided that I can't care for them as much on the road, so I'm settling here. - Speaking of family, where's Blake? - Right here, Don. Come here, Son. Now, your father, he can't do anything about the past, but I'll tell you I can guarantee you I will always be there for you in the future, all right? Don, I'm like a foot taller than you. Hug your father. Come here, Son. There we go. Thanks, Dad. Daddy. I love it. As far as the beautiful lvy Selleck is concerned, she's it for me. - She's the one. - That was just a one-night stand, buddy. No, no, you're my woman. That's my son. Don't overthink it. Now, if someone went and made a beer run, I think we'd have everything we need for a goddamn kickass party. DJ! Play We Are Family by Sister Sledge! Drop it! Finally! Somebody hit the nail on the head. That's what I'm talking about. That is a perfect song. What the fuck? I warned you over and over again not to tell me how to do my job. You brought this on yourself. Are you happy? Just play a good song! You got it, friend! Hey, McDermott, we did it. A happy ending! Yeah, if you call selling cars in Temecula a happy ending. Temecula is not even motherfucking Fresno Well, I'm gonna make the most of it. Ivy Selleck, come here."
11,2010,Morning Glory,American,"Aspiring news producer Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams) has dreamed since childhood of working for the Today show, but her dedication to her career is off-putting to potential suitors. After being laid off from her job at the local Good Morning New Jersey, her mother advises her to give up her dream before it becomes an embarrassment. However, Becky perseveres, sending many different résumés out. She finally receives a call from IBS, which is looking for a producer on its struggling national morning show, DayBreak.
After a discouraging job interview with Jerry Barnes (Jeff Goldblum), who dismisses both her and DayBreak as also-rans, Becky bumps into one of her heroes, veteran television journalist Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) in an elevator. She is brushed off rudely, but is told by the other passenger that this is just typical of Mike. Seemingly against his better judgement, Jerry hires Becky to be DayBreak's executive producer. On her first day, Becky realizes she has signed on to a show in turmoil, lacking in direction and money. After meeting the acerbic but long-suffering co-host Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton), who predicts Becky's demise, she fires the conceited co-host Paul McVee (Ty Burrell), much to the delight of her co-workers. Becky chooses an unwilling Mike as Colleen's new co-host. Mike is under contract to IBS, but has mostly managed to escape being utilized while still getting paid. Becky finds a clause in his contract by which he is obliged to accept an official job offer or lose his salary, so he is forced to comply.
Becky gets to know Adam Bennett (Patrick Wilson), another IBS producer who had worked with Mike previously. After initially teaming up to deal with Mike, they begin dating, and he is initially supportive of her dedication to her job. Pomeroy proves to be hard going, throwing his weight about, trying to sabotage his debut on the show by getting drunk, refusing to banter with Colleen on air, and ensuring he only does serious news stories by making use of a clause in his contract that allows him to refuse certain assignments, like cooking segments, that he considers beneath him. As ratings begin to drop, Becky is told that DayBreak might be canceled.
After a heated confrontation with Mike, Becky snaps and decides on a radical approach to save the show. She improves ratings by persuading Ernie (Matt Malloy), the DayBreak weatherman, to do the weather while doing stunts, such as riding a new Six Flags roller coaster. Colleen also expresses a keen interest in Becky's campaign to rejuvenate the show, and appears on a number of colorful segments that help the show's ratings. Jerry remains unconvinced that Becky can get the ratings up enough to stave off cancellation. Adam, not realizing what is on the line, teases Becky about how caught up she is in improving the ratings, but she sees it as a criticism that she has heard from previous men, and walks out. Mike tells her that he was once the same way, but ended up with no life outside of work.
During a staff meeting, Pomeroy shows interest in doing a story, surprising colleagues. Becky goes along but realizes that he is going to the governor's summer house instead of the destination she expected. Mike ends up confronting the governor on charges of racketeering, and breaks the story of his arrest on live television. This increases DayBreak's ratings enough to secure another year for the show. Due to DayBreak's rise in popularity, Becky receives a job interview from Today. During the interview, DayBreak is on. Between segments, Colleen tells Mike about the interview, and that his refusal to adapt has driven Becky away. He goes to the kitchen where food segments are done. Becky watches in shock as Pomeroy tells the viewers how to make a good frittata. Becky runs back to the set and decides to remain at DayBreak.",6.5,tt1126618,"- Hi. Hi, hi. - Hey. - You must be... - Bill. - Yeah. - Hi. Hi. Becky. Hi. Thanks for having dinner so early. I know it's... it's a pain. No, that's, that's... Interesting crowd. Yeah.

I go to bed really early and we used to be on at, 5am, but then we got bought by this giant company and they wanted to run us instead of infomercials. 'Cause we generate slightly more revenue and... Now we're on at four. Sorry, I'm gonna turn this off. It's so... Sorry. That's like, oh, my God, that's so annoying when people do this. It's like, ""check, please."" I'm not gonna touch this... ever again. Sorry. No, that's, it's... it's OK. It's OK. I... I'm... I'm really glad that you picked this place. I...

Rain will fall when you go to the mall Later will clear, the sun will appear Overnight low is Move your rear Hey, ho, whoo - Hey. - Hi. Hey, I talked to Raymond in HR. He said the company's reorganizing all the stations and they've budgeted us for a new senior producer. They pulled your employment records. You're getting it, Becky. You're finally getting the job. Hey, kiddo, can you come by my office after the show? - Oh, me. - No, not me, you. Yes. The puppy, a Chinese crested is worth over 600 and answers to the... Make your move, jib, make your move... And in Newark today, police arrested members of... What? What's going on? What is that? We thought you might need this. That better not be a box of condoms again and I didn't even use the old one. No, you're gonna use this. Oh, my God. - Congratulations. - Congrats. That's so sweet. Becky, we have to let you go. I'm really sorry about this, kiddo. Corporate wants us to reduce our overhead. We're having to make big cuts and they want me to hire a senior producer with more business experience to manage the contraction of the show. But wait a second. You told them you can't do that, right? Because I... I've been here so long and I've worked so hard. His name is Chip. He's... Chip starts Monday. He has an M.B.A. and a journalism degree from Columbia. They're grooming him to run the whole station in a few years. In the meantime, I can't afford to keep you both. - Becky, look, I'm really... - Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit. Shitty... Becky, I... I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. - I fought them as hard as I could. - There's lots of terrific opportunities out there, you know? I mean, look at Chip. He got one. So maybe this is just the push I need, you know? So it can get me to the next level, maybe even to a network or... - Yeah. - I mean, it's not like it's my whole life. It's only work, right? Did you get any severance? There were some budgetary cuts last year, so they weren't really offering. But I have feelers out. Lots. - Yeah, great. - Honey, you think the Today show is gonna call you up and hand you a job, you have since you were eight, - and it's not gonna happen. - I don't, I know that, I do, I get it. This is partly my fault. I... I let your father get your hopes up. He was not a happy person, let's face it. When he saw you aim high, he started to feel better about himself, - so I never said anything. - What are you saying? You had a dream, you know? Great. When you were eight, it was adorable. When you were 18, it was inspiring. At 28, it's officially embarrassing. And I just want you to stop before we get to heartbreaking. The troops are involved in proJects... Waiting arrival... On my BlackBerry, it shows that you got my e-mail, so I was just wondering if... Yeah, it shows when someone's opened it. Hello? Becky Fuller. Yeah. I wanted to make sure that you got the resume that I e-mailed you. You did. Great. Becky Fuller again. I was just wondering if... Yes, I did call yesterday, but I updated my resume last night and thought you might... I'm calling because I was checking up on the position and I was wondering if it had been... - Hi, Becky Fuller. - Hi. Hi, this is Jerry Barnes calling from IBS in New York. How are you? - Good. - Terrific. Listen, I'm calling 'cause I received your resume, all five of them, actually. And it Just so happens, that we're looking for somebody at the moment. I'll take it. Well, wait, I haven't told you what it is yet. - Sorry. - Well, our morning show - has a vacancy and so... - I'll take it! We're interviewing a bunch of people. Maybe you can come in - and we can have a talk. - Sure! Absolutely. Just tell me where to go and who to talk to. OK, I'll get you an e-mail with the details of where we are in the city. - Sorry! - And shall we say 3:00? Thank you, thank you! Oscar says you're very talented and you work incredibly hard. Says you're the most promising producer that he's ever fired. Well, that's, that's good. I think. So you're a fan of our morning program? - Yeah, I think it has so many... - Yeah, yeah, we know it's terrible. Perpetually in fourth place behind the Today show, Good Morning America and that thing on CBS, whatever it's called. It's a source of constant humiliation. Last year, in the network softball league, the CBS team wore hats that said, ""At least we're not Daybreak."" The anchors of the show are difficult and semi-talented. - I think Colleen Peck is a pro. - Heinous. - Paul McVee is a fine reporter. - Foul. OK. Is Daybreak a shitty show? Yes. But it's on a network. And not just any network. This is one of the most legendary news divisions in the entire history of television! Daybreak just needs someone who believes in it, who understands that a national platform is an invaluable resource, that no story is too low or too high to reach for! Are you gonna... sing? Look, Mr. Barnes. Jerry. Daybreak's facilities are antiquated. It's understaffed, underfunded. And the pay. It's awful, about half of what you made at Hey, How The Hell Are You, New Jersey? You've never been an executive producer. You're too young. Nobody's ever heard of ya. And here, your education, three, not four years, at Fairleigh Dickinson in Teaneck, also known as Fairly Ridiculous. Did I miss anything? Daybreak needs what I need, someone who believes that it can succeed. Trust me, I know you don't have any reason to believe in me, but I work harder than anyone else. I'm in first, I'm out last. I know a shitload more about the news than someone whose daddy paid them to smoke bongs and talk semiotics at Harvard and I devote myself completely to my job. It's what I do. It's all I am. I... You can ask anyone. Well, that's... embarrassing. OK. Thanks for the tour, and... thanks for... for... Thanks. It's these buttons right here. Oh, lobby. Yes, thanks. Good day so far? I don't think so. I talked too much. Ruined it. Damn it. Sir. I am such a huge admirer of yours. I'm a... I'm a big, huge fan. I... My whole family watched you, growing up. I... Of all the anchors, you were, by far, the greatest reporter. I mean when you were in Kosovo, I was in Kosovo. - She work for you? - No. I'm just here to teach her how to use the elevator. Are you done? Yes, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. May I? Oh, God, sorry. I... Of course, of course. Oh, my God, I can't believe I just met the... - Wait a second. You know him. - Yes, I do know him. He's the third worst person in the world. - Hello? - Becky Fuller. - Yes? - You sure you can do this Job? Yes. - You start on Monday. - Thank you. Yes, I am calling about the one-bedroom. Yes, I'm moving into town. I've got a new job. I'm extremely neat and tidy. In summer camp the kids used to pay me to make their beds. Yeah. Sorry, that was an overshare. No loud music. No kids. I don't even have a boyfriend. Just me. I'll take it. I'll take it, I'll take it. Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Also, we'll have more on the flooding in lowa. Finally, some good weather news on the way for those folks. So please Join us tomorrow and thank you for spending - your morning here at Daybreak. - Take care, everyone. - Are you interviewing at Daybreak? - Goodbye. Assistant? Intern? No. Actually, I'm the new executive producer. Another one? Don't unpack. Miss Fuller? Lenny Bergman, Senior Producer. Yes. I know who you are. You started out at WABC. You were at CBS for two years - and here for 13. - Yeah, wow. - Here, let me, let me give you a hand. - I just have one question. Why haven't they bumped you up? It's not for me. I did it for a couple of weeks once, but they put me back at number two. Apparently, the crying was distracting. You'll love it, though. It's a great job. - Our morning meetings are at five. - Isn't that kind of late? - Late? - I mean, it's just that... I'm, I'm used to early hours, so... Well, maybe we should try better doughnuts. Excuse me. At the Today show, the senior staff is usually... Hi. ...in by 4:30... We're just like the Today show, except, you know, without the money, - viewers, respect. But very similar. - OK. OK? That's... that's one of our good doorknobs. Let me take care of this. Colleen Peck has been here forever. Don't mention that. But McVee is paid more. Don't mention that, either. They hate each other. Don't mention that. But that's because Colleen hates everybody. Don't mention that. And she used to sleep with McVee, who threw her over for her assistant. - Do not mention that. - Got it. - After you talk to Colleen... - Yeah, yeah? Make sure you get me before you talk to McVee, so I can go with ya. - Why? - I don't... Just trust me, OK? - OK. - OK. - OK. - Good. - Can I just... - Sure. OK, you ready? - I'm ready. - Good luck. Do you know how many EP's I've had in the past years? Fourteen. If they're stupid, they get fired, and if they're smart, they quit. And now look what I get. Well... - It's a pleasure... - You think it's fun being in last place? Do you think I enjoy working for a network that spends more on one episode of a dating show about a bachelor dwarf than our entire weekly budget? - No... - And I've never had a decent - co-anchor ever! - We're gonna change... Just a revolving door of cretinous morons. Our ratings are in the crapper. I mean, how long can this show limp along like this? I know that everyone's been through a lot, and I know that there's been so many challenges along the way. But, you know... You will fail like everyone else and then you'll be gone, like everyone else. But I will still be here, pulling the train up the hill with my teeth. You think it's fun getting your ass kicked? - No... - Welcome to Daybreak. Enjoy the pain, Gidget. No! It's OK. I have it! I've done this a zillion times and... - I'm gonna fix that and... - See ya later! Good talking to you. Paul! Hi! I'm... I'm Becky Fuller. Your new EP. Thrilled to meet you. I was just thinking maybe we could go over a few ideas. I was thinking maybe we could get you on the street and do some remotes. Yeah, I don't like to leave the studio. I like climate control. But, if you want, we could discuss this further privately. What size are your feet? - You wear about a six and half? Seven? - Pardon? How do you feel about having them photographed? Good? Feel good about that? You should. I keep 'em very classy. I... don't... Can I show you my blog? ""Sexy Feet?"" - No. - Yes? No. - I met Paul. - You talked to him alone? - I told you to come see me first. - I know, but... What was I gonna do? Hi, everyone. Hi, I'm Becky. Hi. Good morning. Oh, God, look who's here. I mean not here. McVee. So shocking, huh? Yeah, well, Mr. McVee doesn't always come to these things. Oh, could you tell Paul that we need him, please? Thanks. OK, so let's just dive in, shall we? Who wants to start? Tomorrow Rocco DiSpirito wants to make lasagna. I told him we did that last week with the Barefoot Contessa, - but he's insisting. What do I do? - For the segment on miniskirts, - do you want all size models? - Next week, I want to do a piece on juice cleanses. All the celebs are doing them and they have amazing powers of rejuvenization. My idea is that I get a juice cleanse and then we can, like, - measure my toxins... - For the Carville interview... I'm sorry, Lisa, do you want the living room set or the stools? ABC says we can't have Eva Longoria until two weeks after - she does G.M.A. What do we do? - On psychic animals, would you prefer a parakeet or an iguana? I'd like to do a piece on weathervanes. They are fascinating. Like did you know the word ""vane"" comes from the Old English ""fana"", - which means flag or weathercock? - Friday, for cooking with squash, - inside or on the plaza? - They're offering us the third lead in the new Patrick Dempsey movie. Do you want him? Great story out of Tampa about a retirement account scandal. But we got to move quick. Should we send a team or just local talent? ...control room's on the fritz. Ten grand to fix it. For that piece on baby food, do we want an actual baby, and if so, white, black, Hispanic, Asian, blonde hair, brown hair, teeth, or no teeth? I have a black baby at home. I'm sorry, I can't hear what you're saying. I... Hello! Hi, hi. Does someone wanna tell me why I had to log off BangingGrannies.com for this? Asshole. Tell Rocco if he insists on making lasagna, he will be bumped. Yes, all size models, but skirts not too short. Toxins? Who said that? They can't be measured. And ""rejuvenization,"" not a word. Tell Longoria's people that she can't plug her next film unless we get her within a week of G.M.A. Parakeet. Ernie, weathercock? Seriously? The plaza for squash. I want Patrick Dempsey. Tell his people we'll run him in the first hour and he can talk about whatever his thing is. Tampa Bay, definitely local talent. And we've got to fix that sound board. Find ten grand in the budget somewhere. The hair and makeup numbers, those were too high. So, Colleen, could you share your hair person with Lisa? That'd be great, great. OK. Asian baby, no teeth. - Lesbian parents. - OK. Did I miss anything? Oh, Paul! You're fired. - You're adorable. - Fired! I'm sorry. That was unprofessional. Congratulations. The first day, you flushed your anchor and you got no money to pay for another one. He was lowering the morale of the show. How is that possible? Look, you must have someone under contract. A local anchor, a reporter. I'll find someone. I'll promote from within. That'll be great for morale! Go nuts. Find somebody great. It just can't cost me a penny. What if I gave them one of my three pennies? Whatever it takes. Just get the ratings up. Lenny, hi. Yeah. Very positive. He thinks we have terrific options. ...plunge from points right before closing. - Analysts fear that this... - He's not bad. Yeah, he's OK. Put a saddle on him, he's good to go. - ...are not happy. - Should we watch again? I got to get home, see the kids, or the wife is gonna kill me. You have kids? What? No. No? Husband? Boyfriend? Me? What? No. - No, I'm sorry. Stupid question. - You know... - You're hideous and repulsive. - You know what? Forget 86. I think that we should watch the Miami guy again, 'cause he was, I mean, you know, he was a little bit tan, but I think... I think that we could wipe that off, it's probably just one of those self-tanner things. I could, you know, fix that. Good night. Hey, look. It's Mike Pomeroy's fangirl. - Hello. - Hey. That was you. That was really embarrassing. I may need to have you killed. I'm... I'm Becky Fuller. Sorry. ""Becky Fuller"" Becky Fuller? The one who took out McVee? You're a legend already. - Thanks. - I'm Adam Bennett. I'm a producer upstairs at Seven Days. - Hello. - So you lookin' for a new anchor? - Yes. - Not that guy. You can't use that guy. That's the horse guy. He's not too bad. I mean, as long as we leave our hand flat when we feed him a carrot. - Well, good luck, Becky Fuller. - Thank you, Adam Bennett. - Need any help? - No. I'm good. Thanks. The sports guy from St. Louis is not bad. Let's watch him again. No, we need some gravitas. We need people to trust us. I mean, if news breaks on the air, we need to be able to cover it credibly. What, do you actually think that we can cover breaking news? - God, that's adorable. - Thousands gathered today to see if the tiny buck-toothed creature would spot his own shadow. But the sad tooth is, according to Punxsutawney Phil, this bitter winter is far from over. Back to you, Mike. What? Yesterday, the Secretary of State held a top-level - State Department security brief... - What's funny? - You put Seabiscuit back in? - But we agree that Hezbollah has shown a willingness to continue to attack. - Becky? - Can I call you back? ...lsraeli incursions. What steps are you taking to limit these Hezbollah retaliations? You have Pomeroy under contract, right? Yeah. He was supposed to do stories for one of our magazine shows. - Yeah? - We couldn't use anything he pitched. - Nothing? - An eight-part story on the United Nations. An interview with a Pashtun warlord. A piece on microfinance in Asia? It's all been so tempting. - Jerry! - So we're just paying him to sit there. Wait. But he must have millions on his contract. You have a world-caliber news man with nothing to do! - Becky, this is... - No, Pomeroy has reported on every major story of the last three decades, with integrity and courage! I mean, he was the only anchor to go down to Ground Zero on the day. His Q ratings, I looked at them, they're unbelievable, - and you're already paying him. - I have to go. We'll discuss this. I... I want to look at his contract! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Hi. I need your approval to look at his contract. Please. Hi. Hi. I'm Becky Fuller and... We actually met the other day in the elevator. And what the hell are you doing here? I'm the producer of Daybreak and we're actually looking for a new anchor. Then why are you here? Well, it's funny that you should ask. Go away. OK, just hear me out, because the show actually has a lot of potential. We're starting over basically, and with an anchor as esteemed and respected as yourself... You've been a journalist your whole life, ever since your elementary school paper, The Beaverton Bee. I mean, you've got to miss it. You... News breaks, it must just kill you - not to be out there. - Morning shows don't do news. Jesus, Daybreak. Half the people that watch your show have lost their remote. The other half are waiting for their nurse to turn them over. If I wanted to come back, I could have any job I chose. But you can't work on another network for another two years. So I'll continue to enjoy my life on IBS's dime. All right, I didn't want to have to do this. - I looked at your contract. - What? - With the lawyers. - My contract? You're right. They do have to pay you for the last two years of your contract. Unless six months have elapsed without you appearing on the air in any capacity. Then, if the network offers you an official position and you don't take it, they can terminate your contract and the six million dollars that you have left on it. So, here's me with an official offer. Mike Pomeroy, the IBS network would like to offer you the position of co-host of Daybreak. - You're joking. - No. Actually, I'm not. Do you have any idea what's going on in the world? And you want me to do stories about baked Alaska? After the career that I've had? You just need to have an open mind. - Open mind. - I mean, yes, the morning news - has a wider range of stories... - A wider range?! Your program is in the news department, you cretin! News is a sacred temple. And you're part of the cabal that's ruining it with horseshit! That's not actually fair. Because the first half hour of a morning show is a damn fine news broadcast. Sure, we cover news and entertainment. That's everything a newspaper has ever done. There's nothing wrong with that. Think of it this way: We're like a well-informed neighbor, coming over to chat with people in the morning. You know, Brokaw did the morning news. And Charlie Gibson. Walter Cronkite did it at the beginning of his career. I mean, he co-hosted a morning program with a puppet named Charlemagne. Well, then... get a puppet. It's inexpensive and uses things you already have around the house. You can make globes, hats, especially piñatas. Now, mâché means ""to chew"" in French, but we're not actually going to be eating any of this, right? Of course not! No. Coming up next, you've heard her sing. Well, today, you're going to hear about her sweet tooth. Join us as we bake brownies with Celine Dion's personal chef. All that and more, coming up on Daybreak. - We're clear! - Oh, my God, will somebody please get this off? Thank you, thank you. - Thank you very much. - OK, so, we don't have time for the sit-down, so we're just gonna run the package, all right? - Are you OK? - What? Don't beat yourself up. He was never gonna do it. Pomeroy? - How did you know that? - Mike was never gonna come to work at this little dog and pony show, especially not working for somebody - like, well, I'm sorry, but you. - OK. Like, yeah. You. Not in a thousand years. I mean, obviously, don't get me wrong, I would have... I would have welcomed him with open arms. Oh, my God. I heard he was coming in, but I didn't... I've won eight Peabodys. A Pulitzer. Sixteen Emmys. I was shot through the forearm in Bosnia. Pulled Colin Powell from a burning Jeep. I laid a cool washcloth on Mother Teresa's forehead during a cholera epidemic. I've had lunch with Dick Cheney. You're here for the money. That is correct. Five, four, three... Fuck. Welcome back to Daybreak. God, does he cook? Does he do... I don't know, fashion segments and gossip? Does he have three-year-old octuplets barf all over him like I did last year? Well, unfortunately, in the '80s, someone gave him story refusal rights, so no. I don't care. Does he know that this is called morning television? Yes, and I think that after a little bit of time, he's really gonna want to do a mix of stories. Face it! I'm going to end up making turkey meatballs with Mario Batali - for the rest of my natural life. - I need the new titles ASAP. OK, let's move it. Single malt. We've got the hand soap, we got the mixers, the papers, the tropical fruit. Here we go. Whoever heard of mangosteen? - Apparently, he has. - This is Colleen's dressing room and... She's so looking forward to seeing you. Good. Great. Glad to hear it. And this is mine? Yes, but Colleen is... Never mind. You got me the newspapers? The mixers? The tropical fruit plate. All stipulated in your ten-page rider. - Nice of you. - Yes... Colleen wants me, I'll be in here. OK. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He should come in here. - OK. - What the hell is that? No hurry. No. No and no. OK. Did you tell her I have papaya in here? He gets a tropical fruit plate? That is just so pathetic. That guy might be our only hope. So I suggest you just man up and get in there! That is such a good speech! Guess what? I'm not going. So, we'll be shooting Mike's promos all week and then we'll finalize the format of the show on Friday. Then we'll rehearse Mike's openings and segues. Excuse me. Who is going to say goodbye? - Pardon? - Well, at the end of the show? It doesn't really matter. I mean, Mike, you don't mind if Colleen says goodbye? Well, who do you think the public would rather hear from last? Someone who's won every broadcast award on the face of the planet or the former Miss Pacoima? It's Arizona! In case you're interested, I was Miss Arizona! Christ! We can't both have our arms folded. And I am the female here, I think. - Colleen on this side. - Of course, I'd be more than happy to. Can you just step away, just for a second? Thanks. We don't want to take up your precious... Hello?! - Is that better? - What's next? Bubble bath? Hey. Hi! - Hey. - Hi. Hey, I just came to... to offer my condolences on hiring the third worst person in the world. Thanks. Yes. I... Who are the other two? Kim Jong-il and Angela Lansbury, actually. - She knows what she did. - OK. So, I... I gather that you worked with Mike at the nightly news. Worst year of my life. The entire time we worked together, the only thing he ever called me was Señor Dipshit. It's not funny. - I'm sorry, that's not funny. - No. That's terrible. That is terrible, actually. Yeah, so... So now is an excellent time for you to take up drinking. And... And I came by to say that sometimes after work, a few of us go over to Schiller's on Madison, so, you know, if you're ever around... - Around. - Yeah, available. Oh, OK. Yeah. That... would be nice. Yeah, I... I don't, I don't really go out very much, but if I'm in the neighborhood, - I will definitely stop by and say hi. - Well, like tomorrow. - Around eight. - OK. Yeah, sounds good. - All right. - Sure, yeah. - Bye. - Bye. That's not too shabby. You got a new anchor. Somebody asked you out on a date. Things are lookin' up. That was... He... Not asking me out on a date. I think it was. I was standin' right there. - No, no. - Yeah. He was just mentioning that he might be somewhere. I mean... Come on, please, I think I would know if I was being asked out on a date. - It's a date. - So, we've got the bird whisperer - confirmed for Tuesday? - Yes. Great. And... Al Green on the plaza Wednesday. - Two songs. - OK. And Colleen, do you want to do the interview between the songs? No, let me. Yeah, I'll do it. OK. Mike, so we have this great story on children's water safety. - That's the... - Not my thing. OK, how about a rundown of the new shows on the fall television season? - Oh, yeah. That's a no. - OK. The boom in organic farming. Very hot topic right now. That's newsy, right? What do you want me to do? Fire another anchor? Then we're gonna be stuck with that guy who counts with his hooves. Colleen can't do every story that's not hard news. It's Mike Pomeroy. He's a legend. What am I supposed to tell him? - There she is. - What...? Oh, hi. Interesting, Jerry hired you. No polish. No pedigree. Those bangs. What was he thinking? Just wondering. - He's a peach. - Yeah. Coming soon to Daybreak, one of the most legendary newsmen of all time. Soon, he'll be bringing his experience to morning television. Let Mike Pomeroy show you the world over your first cup of coffee! - Oh, for Christ's sake. - What? What, what, what is it now? It's embarrassing. I mean, what's in the briefcase? - What do you mean? What? - Special anchorman papers? - It doesn't matter. - My lunch? Where am I going? - We've been over this eight times! - I'm running to nowhere. - I look like a jackass! - No... Yes, you do. You know, whoever gave you promo approval was smoking crack! - I want to meet that person. - I was mopping the floor - with Peter Jennings at the time. - I want to have words with... I could have had hookers and eight balls written into my contract. - How nice for you. - ...over your first cup of coffee. Why do we have to mention that first cup of coffee? Why not just say, ""Watch Mike Pomeroy before your morning dump?"" One of the most legendary newsmen... So for the fashion segments, I think it's important that we interpret runway trends for our viewers because they're not all six foot and size zero. - Man, he's cute. - I went to Yale with him. - Shut up. - You did not. Everyone was madly in love with him. Actually, just me and every single person I knew. - Can we just...? - His dad was editor of Newsweek. His mom's family is rich as hell. They own like Tupperware or something. He rowed crew for Yale when they won the national championship. Hi. - You know him? - No. Yeah, well, yes, I mean, I... - Yes. - Don't you think he's smokin'? - Smokin'. - Yeah. I don't know, I don't know. Let me see. I don't know. - Not a hard question. - He's walking away. So jeans and belts. You have a rash or something spreading on your neck. Well, you know, I asked him to do a piece on Trump. And he actually picked up my Diet Coke and hurled it across the room. - Wow, he picked it up. - Just missed me. He did. I asked him to cover a bumper crop of cranberries and he slapped me in the face. - He did? - It's true. - Really? - Of course, he was drunk off his ass. Adam! - Hi. - Hi. How are ya? - I'm good. - Hi. - You never called me! - I'm sorry. We... I was... I've been workin' a lot. Well, maybe I'll see you at Barton's regatta party on Saturday. - Great, great. - OK, great. Yeah, cool. - Sorry, I was just... - That's OK. Absolutely fine. That's fine, fine. - Bye. - See you later. - Yeah. - So, anyway, the reason that I came by tonight, was because I don't really know that many people who know Mike, and I thought, that, you know, I could get your professional feedback. - My feedback? - Yeah, you know. I mean, 'cause I'm actually new in town and I don't... - Come on. - No, please. ...have that many work contacts, so... Great. So... we'll be contacts? That would be great. Well, you can never have enough of those. No, you can't. So, definitely be seeing you around. - OK. - OK. Shit. OK. Good rehearsal. Good stuff. So let's just alternate the voiceover intros of the headlines. - OK. - And then ad-lib. So, let's say, for example, we're doing a story about, I don't know, - a midterm election. - But we won't. Because the morning shows don't do news. Pompous. That's really interesting. That's a different color for you. - That's... - OK, and you two should just sort of, you know, banter back and forth a little bit. Banter, from the Latin word, meaning ""to gibber like a moron?"" Just, you know, talk about the headlines. That's... that's what I mean. I'm not gonna sit here and rehearse like I'm in summer stock. I've been on the air for years, for Christ's sake. I think I know how to ad-lib. The spill began when the tanker was damaged in heavy seas outside Galveston. Knock, knock. Can I come in? I just wanted to say, you know, good luck. Colleen's Pap smear. A television classic. Are you drunk? Insufficiently. Current weather conditions are complicating efforts - ...to contain the... - That's my chair. What? That's where I belong. There. ...authorities have asked the federal government... Took it away from me, those motherfu... I think maybe you should just go home... - See this? - Yes. What is that? Forty-year-old Bruichladdich. I only drink this when I'm practically suicidal. OK. You're, you're very funny. Well, I'm gonna see you tomorrow... right? ...is almost impossible to calculate. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. I... Sorry. I thought that I might swing by to... ...see if... What are you working on? We're working on a piece on the communist rebels in the Philippines. Good. That sounds great. So I went to the bar the other night to see you. Yeah, I could tell. By the way you ran in the other direction. Your arms, pinwheeling. Yeah. OK, fair, true. I think that you're sort of... ...comically great. And I thought it seemed so promising so I bungled it, because that's what I do. I bungle things. I bungle and I ramble, and that's kind of like what I'm doing right now, talking about it. You threw me off guard. You, with your... And the... and the, this... And the... My working on a loom? - My, my... - No. - ...double-handed craps. My... - I... - My Jazzercise. - Rowing. Rowing. - Rowing? - Championship? I never would have got that. But you know what I mean. That I didn't think that you... liked me. But I do. Oddly. You're... different. And a deeply terrible mime. Well, I asked you out. Then when I saw you at the bar, I practically tackled you to the ground. What part of that was confusing? Here, here, here, sit down. Look, my radar for that kind of thing is so bad. I mean, I don't know if a man's interested in me until he's naked. I mean, the pants come off and then I'm like, ""I guess you don't really want to see my CD collection - or talk about Kerouac."" - You're nuts. OK, look. Let's start over. Let's go out to dinner like... regular people. Just take it slowly, just see where it leads. - How does that sound? - That sounds perfect. Oh, God, I should go home. It's eight! It's eight already. - I know. - It's Mike's first day tomorrow. - You should definitely go. - What's the big whoop? I mean, you know, he's done this like a million times before. - Yeah. - And he knows exactly what he's doing. - Yeah. - So... It's fine. He didn't open a bottle of 40-year-old Bruichladdich, did he? How do you know that? What? When I was working with him, if there was something that he didn't want to do, the Oscars, the Olympics, something that people might actually get a tiny twinge of pleasure from, the night before, he would go on a bender. Call in sick for work the next day. No. No, no. This is ridiculous. I'm not... I'm not going out there and chasing him around. If he wants to screw this up, that is his problem. - Start at Elaine's. - Oh, God, thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry. We'll do it again sometime. Thanks. - Pomeroy? - Yeah. He was here. He left about an hour ago. Oh, no. The little woman. - Incoming. - Jesus Christ, Pomeroy, they're getting younger and younger. Mike... I need to talk to you. Why? Is the baby mine? I will have you know that this show is very important to a lot of people, including but not limited to me. My ass is on the line here. Actually, your ass is irrelevant. You're just a footnote. It's my ass, my reputation, my integrity, mine! ""Mine!"" You're such an egotistical, selfish person! I'm on-air talent! Get in. Hey! OK, I'm home. You can leave. Oh, no. No. Wow. Oh, my God. - Is that a real... - Good night Of course. Here we are Just about the same You're alone tonight? Makes sense. Let me guess. You meet a guy. You have about three dates. Spend the whole time talking about your job. He loses your phone number. Aside from your obvious father issues, what'd he do? Leave you? Die? You've got this... repellent moxie. Look at all the stories you could be doing here. About art and hunting and fishing. I mean, you have grandchildren. I didn't even know you had kids. Look, we could be doing parenting segments. You should invite them down to the show. The ungrateful little bastards. I don't think so. Well, the little tour's over. Time to go back to your sad little life. I'm not going anywhere until we are on the air. Well, please don't snore. I'm a light sleeper. I'm not going to be sleeping. Just about the same Foggy little fella Drowsy little dame Two sleepy people by dawn's early light And too much in love to say good night Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Let's go, girl. - What are you doing? - Have you ever seen a real egg? These are from pastured hens in Maryland. - We have to go. - I have them delivered once a week. We have to go. Now, the beauty of a frittata is that it can be made with any ingredient. Anything that's in your refrigerator. - Good. Get dressed. - What? You want me to starve? I've got to be in tip-top shape. I'm going to appear on national television in front of... - What, six or eight people? - Mike, come on. Coffee? What few people know is that the frittata was meant to be eaten at room temperature. - It was invented in Italy... - Come on. - ...for the afternoon repast. - Look, guess what? I don't really care about your epicurean breakfast, OK? I just need you to walk faster, because we are going to be late. Hey. Hello, there. - Where the hell have you been? - It's a long story. She spent the night at my place. Come on, everyone. I slept on the couch. Until I woke her up with my... African rain stick. All right. OK. It's Mike's first show, so it's a really big day for us. - Fire me today. - Yeah, so let's go... through the lineup from the top. One more time. We start with eight, full track. We'll be cutting to nine with announce. Nine will reveal the jib. Jib, start a little wider. OK. What are they promo-ing on the Today show today? - What aren't they promo-ing? - What? Crap. No. Vieira scored that interview with the drunk-driving Playboy Playmate? What's on G.M.A.? - Well, she's doin' Clooney. Yeah. - Bitch. Try not to bore the nation into a coma with your dull news crap, OK? Yes, certainly. Oh, and... suck it. Well, they look great together, so that's promising. Oh, heavenly ghost of Edward R. Murrow. OK, the Jewish guy is crossing himself, so we're confident. Thirty seconds to air. Everybody ready? They know about the cake? Everybody does? Stage manager's got that covered? Good. - Cake is good to go. D-Day. - I want the double matte through both names, both names. Great. OK, stand by... Stand by, ticker. Stand by, Deko, that's great. - You ready for this? - I'm ready.

We are so lucky to have a Journalist of your caliber here with us, Mike. We're Just... what can we say except, welcome, welcome. Yes. - He said yes. - That's it? - Yes? He said yes. - Yes.

Also, we'll talk to some relief workers who say the international community - has abrogated its duty to protect... - What the hell is abrogated? That wasn't on the teleprompter. - Ready to widen on two. - And that's our show for this morning. Welcome to the Daybreak family, Mike. - And thank you... - Thank you, everyone. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - How many is that? - Goodbye. - Three each. - Bye. - And we're out! - Fade to black. Here we go. - Bye-bye. You know what you are? Excuse me for saying this, but you're an asshole, OK? - Becky! What's her last name? - You said you would banter! No, no, no, no. You said I would banter. I said I would anchor a news show. That's what my contract calls for. And that's what I'm going to do. But, Mike, you can't just go out there and give monosyllabic answers - and talk about natural disasters! - Are you sure? 'Cause I think that's what I just did. Anyway, what are you doing here? You have to get back to your office and wait for your phone call from Jimmy Carter. - What? - Jimmy Carter, ""sexual offender."" Now, go away, I'm busy. - But Mike, can you just promise... - Go away. Go away. I just go away! Hey. It wasn't that bad. I don't wanna talk about it. OK. There's a plan. Sorry, just... Hey. I may need to see who that is. - OK. What if something happens? - Then someone else will cover the world's biggest pumpkin. - That's not fair. - No. No. Because you work for a magazine show. - Yes. - And you do one 15-minute story - every two months. - That's right. And we are doing stories a day, none more than three minutes each, I mean, maybe three and a half, if it's the President or they're nude photos or something... How reliable is your alarm clock? ...is making progress. However, one good piece of news - is that the winds have come in... - What's goin' on? Fire out west. They're looking for an arsonist and they think that he might have set the fire, like, three weeks ago? He could be a serial offender. - It's the middle of the night. - I'm sorry. I have had such a lovely time. I really have and I... - I'm so glad that we... - Go. - What? - You want to go. You should go. Are you sure about that? Get out of here. Thank you. Good Morning America got the mother of the arsonist. What? Ass! Don't. All right, I need an arsonist spouse or something. - Damn it. - So you're gettin'scooped like every morning. How come? I mean, do you have any kind of plan? Yes, the show will still... need some fine-tuning... Fine-tuning? Really? Can you tune something when nothing is working? Mike Pomeroy is the key to making this show work. Well, at the moment, he's ruining your show, and to be honest, you haven't got much time for fine-tuning, right? - Yeah. I'm not worried. - You're... Really? I'm not worried. How about profiles? We're doing a piece on Daniel Boulud. Does it end with me in the kitchen making profiterole? No. Cornish hens. OK, forget that. How about an interview with Tim McGraw and Faith Hill? Either one of them becomes president or cures cancer, let me know. But I do have one good lead. Yeah? Yeah, really? - I hear you're dating Señor Dipshit. - What? - How did you make that happen? - Who told you that? - Him and you, really? - No, I'm... Because usually, you know, he dates girls that are sort of, you know with... Taffy pullers with... heavy meatballs? There's a developing story coming out of Albany, though. The governor's tax returns are being audited. Oh, for God's sakes, you're killing me, no! - I want people to get to know you. - No, you don't. You want me to pander so you can sell erectile dysfunction medication. - Oh, no, I don't. - Well, I won't! Oh, my God! It's you, you're that guy! I just saw you this morning and everyone was eating stuffed zucchini, and you were cranky about it. I was like, ""Oh, my God, there's that guy!"" You used to do news, right? Like a while ago? It's... Please, remove your hand from my person. Thank you. This is great! Thank you! I can't believe it! Dan Rather! - Dan Rather! - See? People want to like you. You're... you're in their home every day, and, you know, it's an honor and, you know, why can't you just do stories people might enjoy? Mike... We're in trouble. I'm in trouble. Help me, please. Dan Rather. For Christ's sake. Becky! Becky! Becky. I have a great idea for a segment. Get ready for this. Past lives. If we could find out who celebrities had been in their past lives, I think that would be terrific, don't you? I mean, what if Justin Timberlake had been Abraham Lincoln? Many actors have changed their names to be taken more seriously. Ricky Schroder became Rick. The Rock became Dwayne Johnson. And Portia de Rossi's name used to be Amanda, but she changed it so as to sound more like the car, which she felt sounded more impressorial. A new name has become the latest, hottest accessory for celebrities, like a Birkin bag or a baby. Back to you, Mike or Michael. - Dissolve to Mike and ticker in. - How did she get here? - Don't ask. - What? Is she sleeping with someone? Pardon me? Thanks. - Have you seen these? - Yes, but... You want to make the ratings worse? That's why you came here? Well, no. Mike is still getting up to speed. - I'm working on a couple elements. - Gettin' Mike up to speed? - Yeah. - You're circling the drain. You rarely book anybody decent because of the ratings. - You're not gettin' any big interviews. - We just need more time. - Just a little... - God, you're, you're more naïve - than I thought, aren't ya? - Excuse me? The network wants to cancel the show. They want to run game shows and syndicated talk instead. For a second, I thought you might have a shot, especially when you got Pomeroy. But the joke's on me, 'cause it turns out you failed even more completely than the network thought. In six weeks, they cancel the show. Not only will you have significantly weakened our news division, you will have presided over the demise of a show that's been on the air for years! Nice work. Why don't you go over to PBS and see if you can kill Sesame Street. Go. You've wasted enough of my time. We have six weeks. Can you just not tell anyone yet? Because morale isn't exactly at a peak. Fine. Tell 'em when you want to. It doesn't really matter, does it? Piper, get Phil Griffin on the phone. Tell him if I don't hear from him by 5:00, those Super Bowl tickets go to Phyllis McGrady! ...Joins us now with details. Roger. It certainly is a happy day here on Lincoln Road between Bedford Avenue and Rogers Avenue. This is, yes, officials... - We're live at five, people. - OK. Feathery, fleecy, flocculent? - Oh, for Christ's sake. - What? What's going on now? Mike is offended by a word in the next story. He's offended. It's about Easter chicks. I'm not saying the word ""fluffy."" It's bad enough I have to do these ridiculous stories. You know what, buddy? Guess what? Last week, I had to use the words ""rectal"" and ""moisture"" in the same sentence. - Well, first dates can be awkward. - Mike! - Becky... - That's it! - Becky, Becky, what are you doin'? - I've had enough! - Mike? I need to talk to you. - Becky, we're back in 60. I'm sorry, this'll just take a second. I've looked up to you all my life. You know that? I actually idolized you. My dad and I used to watch you on TV. So just, you know, imagine my surprise when it turns out that you're actually the worst person in the entire world. - Not the third worst! The worst! - What's goin' on? Pomeroy. He broke the latest Daybreak EP. ...how lucky we all are to have these Jobs, - how quickly that can be taken away. - We're back in... And there's this guy, this really kind of great, smokin' guy who can actually stand me long enough to have sex with me. And you know what? It's all just a big mess. Because of you! You know, nobody can do their jobs well around here because you can't be bothered to do yours at all! And we're back. Welcome back to Daybreak. And now, with a check of the weather, - here's Ernie. - Take Ernie on the plaza. Thanks, Colleen. Surprisingly toasty day out here, isn't it, folks? Yeah! Good day to break out the bikini. I know I'm wearing mine right now. All right. Well, what do we have here? Goodness, honey. I did not put her up to this. - Coke? Diet Coke? - No, I don't want a Diet Coke. Step aside! - Jerry, I would like to talk to you. - You're gonna bust a cap in my ass? What if I get the ratings up? We've got six weeks. What if I move that needle just enough? - You won't. - We'll, you're... you don't know that. - Becky. - There's got to be some number I can hit that will give us a shot, that would give us an extra six months, - something. - Sure, if you got over one point five - or something absurd like that... - Done! So I've got your word? I get those ratings up more than three quarters of a point, - you give me more time? - It won't happen. We'll see about that. And your girlfriend Lisa? Can you get her a dictionary and stick her on somebody else's show? 'Cause she's killing me. Wow, well, look who the wind blew in! What happened to you? Well, we're gonna change a few things. - OK. - Is Ernie in place? Yes, he is. He'll be interviewing people as they come off the coaster. No, he won't. Not anymore, he's not. We're gonna put him on that coaster. We're gonna strap a handheld to the car in front of him and then go live. Boom. It's called ""picking up the game,"" people. OK? So from now on, every single story that we do, it's gonna have to be sensational! We're gonna be more aggressive. We're gonna work harder. And we're gonna do it right now. - Are, are you gonna...? - I'm not gonna sing! Why do people ask me that? So the big question is, are we gonna be able to hear his mic? Yes, we will. If he has a heart attack, we'll be able to capture every heartrending scream. - Really? Great. - Cue her. Thrill-seekers have something to look forward to this summer as Six Flags unveils a brand-new roller coaster. The ""Manhandler"" is the fastest coaster in the U.S. - with speeds up to miles an hour... - Stand Ernie by. Here we go. ...ninety-five degrees. Our own Ernie Appleby is getting a sneak peek at this amazing new ride, isn't that right, Ernie? - Standing by. Open his mic. - Ernie, can you hear us? Yes. Yes, I can. And so far, it's a beautiful ride. Quite an amazing view from up here. Mostly blue skies. Cumulus clouds on the horizon, always a good sign this time of year. Might be heading into our first dip. Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, fu... No! Oh, yeah. No, this is a great idea. - Please, make it stop! - Take two. What are you gonna do to him next? Strap electrodes to his balls? I actually felt sorry for that animatronic puppet asshole. Hey, look, we got 80,000 hits on YouTube already. And Ernie is absolutely thrilled. And by the way, we had another bump in the minute-to-minutes. - Becky, good stuff. - Thank you! Lighten up, Mike. You know what I've noticed? People only say, ""Lighten up"" when they're gonna stick their fist up your ass. Well, you know what? I hate to break it to you, - but the fact is... - Oh, my God, amazing segment. Thank you. The world has been debating news versus entertainment for years and guess what? Mike, your side lost. - You know what? - What? You're wrong. People are smart. They want information. Not junk, which is all you're willing to give them. - Junk. Sugar, sugar, sugar. - Excuse me. - OK. - And more sugar. Yeah, well, what would you have them do, Mike? Eat bran all day? Fiber, fiber, fiber? We have to get the ratings up, Mike, or we can have a lot of high-minded ideas and not be on the air. This show may go down, but it's not because I'm not trying my hardest. You hear me? I don't care what you do, but I'm not giving up. I wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to you right now about Ernie. I wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to you right now about Ernie. - Oh, my God, you, too? - Yes. Why is everyone worried about Ernie? You know, he's a grown man. - Worried about Ernie? You kidding me? - He signed release forms. He's a hack. Look, I see what you're doing. I think it's great. It's exactly what I've been waiting for, so just, you know, sign me up, coach. Put me in. - Whatever you want to call it. - Really? Yeah. Do you have any preexisting conditions? Are you kidding? Look at me. I'm a rock. Would you like to hold him? I would love to hold it, dear little thing. Watch it. Careful he doesn't go in there. Can you get it out though? Mike wanted to be here for this. Mike Pomeroy. You know how he is. He loves animals. Have you just... You... And then... Those are frog lips. Does a frog open its lips ever? Ready four, take four. Ready one. Take one. Ready one. Take it. - I would never do that. - Kiss it. How about a big kiss, sucker? That's a little, that's wrong. That was so good. Do it again. Fitty, Fitty! Mr. Cent? Hi! Fan. Big fan! Take you to the candy shop - Whoa, let you lick - I heard the song. I'm a producer for Daybreak and we would so love to have you on our show. We'd give you twice as much time as the Today show. And you could play four songs from your new record. Just think about it. I'll take you to the candy shop I'll let you lick the lollypop - Oh! - Go 'head girl, Don't you stop Yeah! Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa! I'll take you to the candy shop Boy one taste of what I got I'll have you spending all you got... Ready one, take one! Ready two! Well! On the rabbi story, do you want the transvestite prostitute - to be dressed as a man or a woman? - A man. - Man. - No, a woman. No, have himher start the segment as a woman and then, boom, after the break heshe comes back as a man! - Yes. That's it. - Yes. Yes. Back to you, Colleen. - All right! They've cut! - Both. Emphatically. Here are the ratings. I know, I know. Yes, yes. And when we come back, we'll tell you about new ways to cope with menopause. New doorknobs. OK. - And am I doing it right? - Yes. How do you know? You're not looking. Or we could do a whole series on senior weight loss. A five-parter. We could get that health expert, you know, the one with the... It's good, it's good, it's good. I'll do it. Wait! Wait, look. The week-to-weeks are better and total viewers are up by five percent! And those are not good enough! Turns out the burger patties were contaminated with E. coli, which can cause cramping and diarrhea. - Lose the ticker, music in... - We'll be right back on Daybreak. Dissolve the logo. And mark. And we're out. Great, a story about uncontrollable shitting and look who gets it. Well, it's not my sort of thing. Can I just say one thing? That's our job. I know you think you're above it and, of course, you were above it before you got fired. But now, guess what, you're down in the muck with the rest of us, Mike. And yet I still have standards, unfortunately for you. - Suppose I don't have standards? - Sure, you do. When you got your Pap smear on air, you wore a silk robe. - OK! - Classy touch. - We're back in five... - That is it! I've had it with you! I've had it! - Three... and two... - Go, two. - ...one. - Dissolve and cue. Tomorrow on the show, Colleen will make the British classic bangers - and mash, with chef Gordon Ramsay. - That's right, I will, because you refuse to do it, Mike. Guess it's beneath you. Well, that and it's tough to get between you and a sausage, so... Sausage, that's a good one. Yes, and also you are a fatuous, pretentious idiot, - so there's that. - A fatuous idiot who makes - three times what you make. - That's our show for this morning. See you tomorrow, folks. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - And goodbye. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Yeah, no, no, no. - Bye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Bye. This is yesterday, - after she insulted his tie. - Right. After he asked her if she cries ice cubes. Huge spike. They love it! We're so close. I mean, we need this. We're, we're, we're almost there. Coming up in our next hour, we'll be talking to people who successfully completed this innovative rehab program. Might want to pick up a few tips there, Mike. Do they have rehab programs for bitter beauty queens with self-esteem issues? I wonder about that sometimes. Sometimes. Well, coming up next... But they are way better. They're way up from last year. I'm, I'm almost there. So many people rely on this show. They believe in it. You have until Friday. That's the deal we made. And those are still not good enough. ...so no real flooding to speak of in the neighborhoods. But the concern is, they are prepared... - ...to help folks if necessary, Kitty. - What? Well, the center of lowa's second biggest city, Cedar Rapids, is already underwater. Sorry. I mean, our demos are getting better. But our overall numbers, they're just not where they should be. We're just missing... something. Well, maybe it's time for another eight-part series on the orgasm. Do you think so? I mean, I don't know what else we would possibly talk about. - You're making fun of me. - No. Never mind. Just... doesn't matter. I'll just deal with it in the morning. You look at me like there's something wrong with me all the time. - And I can't, I can't do it. - What? That is the most ridiculous statement you have ever made. I can't let my guard down for one second, you know. I don't look at my BlackBerry and I miss getting the next big story. And I'm tired of feeling guilty about my work. I can't. Becky, wait a second. Yeah. OK. Look, that information's a matter of public record. I have a right to see it. You know that. You want me to come on down there and I'll bring a crew? Better yet, a subpoena. OK, and I think we should end the segment with Ernie being tarred and feathered in honor of the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party. Or I could do my good story on weathervanes. No! OK, so great job, everyone. Excuse me, excuse me. Just one, one moment, please. I have a story I'd like to do. Sauerkraut. Sauerkraut? Big annual Sauerkraut Festival upstate. They bowl with cabbage, make a big sauerkraut cake. They... have a competition for the best sauerkraut. You want to do that? What? Do you have a problem with that? No. It's OK? I'm doing the kraut? Right? - If you, if you want to. - Good. Good. Hi! - Hi! - Don't really have to go, you know. I want to. My goodness. I wouldn't miss this for... - Get in. - All right. Say hello to Joe. - Joe, Becky. Becky, Joe. Go. - Hi, Joe. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This isn't the way. No, no. - Mike, where are we going? - To cover the news. - What? - At 8am this morning, - I'm going to cover a story. - Mike. - A real story. - Are you kidding me? - Where are you? - I don't know. - What do you mean, you don't know? - Well, he won't tell me. He's kidnapped me. He's gone around some kind of bend and I need you to get Colleen ready with a backup story, please! - What backup story? - Let Ernie do the weathervane thing. - No, no, no, no. Jesus. - I need something when Mike's story tanks. You know, you're a terrible person! You baited me with sauerkraut. That's so low. I mean, what the hell is this story, Mike?! - The governor. - What governor? We're not even anywhere near Albany. No, we're not. It's up here a little further, Joe. - A little further. - Oh, my God, this is the governor's country house. Are you out of your mind? You're experiencing a psychotic break. Are you insane? Well, I won't be dragged down with you. You're gonna get us arrested and fired. I get fired, I never work again, you lunatic. I'm not gonna run it, Mike. I won't, you can't make me. I'll run Colleen getting her bikini line waxed before I run it. Mike! They're gonna cancel the show! If we don't get our numbers up by the end of this week, we're toast. We're gonna be replaced by soap operas and... game shows. Come on, Joe. - Lenny, are you ready? - Ready? - Ready? Ready for what? - Jesus. - Check, check. - Hey. You'll know when to go live. Get out of my shot. Go live with what? Pomeroy! - Gary, how are ya? - What the hell are you doin'here? I need the weathervanes, Lenny. - I need 'em, need... - So we're goin' with weathervanes. - Yes. - Specifically, we'd like to know how you feel about the Attorney General's filing racketeering charges against you this morning. - Charges of corruption... - No, wait, wait. - ...and steering government contracts. - Wait, wait, wait. - We cannot wait! - Hold your horses. And there's a hooker or two... in there as well, isn't there, sir? - Oh, my God. - Becky! - What is going on here? - Comin' through! Mike, I don't know where you get your information. You know I like you. - Stand by to go live. - What? ...but if you don't leave, I'm gonna have to call the police. - Wait one second. - I don't think that's gonna be necessary, sir. Becky! Live! Live! Live to Becky, now! - Up on rem two! - Now taking you live to Mike Pomeroy for a special report. Federal authorities have been planning this raid for weeks. This reporter has learned that the indictment contains counts of racketeering and using undue influence. My sources tell me authorities have tapped phone calls, and incriminating e-mails. Mike Pomeroy, Daybreak. Back to you in the studio. - Take two. - Thanks, Mike. Partly cloudy skies this afternoon with slight chance... You know, you could have told me. I might have covered it anyway. Liar. Look, I get it. Nobody really cares that I can do this job, but... But I can. I wanted you to see that. That was a great story, Mike. That was... that was better than a great story, that was great television. I mean, that was bran with a doughnut. A bran doughnut. I've got a grandkid. Did you know that? Alexander. I haven't seen him since I got fired. I was embarrassed... after all I'd accomplished. And then to... ...come back to the news... this way. The truth is, I'd... I'd screwed up with my kids way before I got canned. Anyway, I was never at home and... ...when I was, I took every phone call, watching TV out of the corner of my eye. Why am I telling you this? You're worse than I am. You'd sleep at the office if you could. Let me tell you how it turns out. You end up with... with nothing. Nothing. Which is... which is what I had... ...till you came along. Wait a second. Did you just say something nice to me? I told you I could banter. Felt like getting a jump on it. They're not... awful. How much longer can we get? Well, I have to check with upstairs, but... with these I can get you a year, a comfortable year. I underestimated you, Becky. That's... that's very, very true. NBC called. NBC? Wanted to know how much time you have on your contract. The Today show wants you. Well, that's very flattering. I... Is that what you want? They were gonna cancel the show. - OK. - Yeah. And somehow, we saved it. And, you know, the thing is... is that the second I knew that everything was gonna be OK, the person that I wanted to tell was you. The Today show? That's huge. Yeah, yeah, it's, it's, it's incredible. But I, I have to think about it. I... - What? - Well, yeah, I mean, I... Well, the thing is, is that at Daybreak, everyone's really starting to click. Everybody's pitching in and doing what they're best at. - No story too high or low. - No, hold on, you can't say no to this. When you get an opportunity like this, - you have to grab it. - Even Mike is almost happy. And that's a good enough reason to give up the best job in broadcasting? We're... Daybreak is a family now. Becky, I've known Mike a long time. I... It doesn't matter how happy he is. He's not just gonna suddenly change into a different person. Well, I think you're wrong. I know what I'm doing with him now. I do. I do. It's gonna be great. So we've got the Supreme Court Justice hearings at the top of the hour and then... I forgot to tell you, Anthony Bourdain - wants to do a segment with you! - Bourdain? Love him. Not doin' that. But say hi to Tony. I owe him a bottle of Patron. - What...? - What? We do one good story together and suddenly I'm your bitch? Don't think so. Sorry. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. You can't do one story for me? Oh, my God, what is wrong with me? What am I doing here, beating my head against this wall? I might as well go to the Today show where you don't have to poke - Matt Lauer with a stick... - The Today show? - Yes, they offered me a job. - Of course. - But you know what? I said... - Time to move on. You'll love the Today show. You and Vieira can do menopause stories every week! You know what's really ridiculous? Is that until about ten seconds ago, I'd actually considered turning my back on the best job I've ever been offered. Isn't that totally absurd? What's keeping you? OK. You know, if you'd ever treated me with some kind of friendship or loyalty, or trust, these things that you seem incapable of... You miserable, lonely, egotistical, selfish asshole! - Hey, Becky. - Hi. They called again. Today show. Thanks. Becky Fuller. Obviously, we have a long track record of success here at the Today show, but we're always looking to stay current, to get out of our comfort zone, and we want the show to have that youthful energy. And we are so impressed with what you have done with Daybreak. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Everyone is talking about it. You must know that. I mean, you have done an amazing job of revitalizing a show that many people had just completely written off. Well, thank you. Thanks. And we're out! You did this. They're gonna hire her. Yeah. She's at the Today show right now, ding dong. Do you have any idea, you know, what you've done here? Because we had a decent producer, a decent show and, God forbid, anyone around here should be happy, but you had to have this happen, didn't you? All right, stand by, folks. Here we go. Three, two, one. And dissolve two. And cue 'em! Cue 'em! - Welcome back to Daybreak. - What is wrong? ...at the nation's crumbling infrastructure. Go to Colleen. Jesus, jump off Mike. - Where the hell is he going? - Take three, three. Cue over to three. Swing her to three, please. Come on, Jane, over to three. Sorry, the... this segment's usually a two shot of Mike and Colleen and Mike's not there. They've probably just changed something. Sorry. I don't know. Where is Mike? - I need eggs. - You need what? You know, from chickens. Eggs! Really don't enjoy this job. Chinese people, move, move, move! Thank you! Celery. Peppers. Cheese. Cheese. Yeah, thank you very much. We wanted to know what your plans are for sports coverage. Sports. Great, OK. Great. I love sports. Come on, move, move! Let's go, let's go! - Get it in there, slide it in! - Mike, tell us what you need. I need a cutting board, good knife, nice plate, bowl, whisk. What is this, rubber? Get me a real bowl. - Where are my eggs?! - Cue over to three. - Where are my goddamn eggs?! - Eggs for Mike, please! In respect to sports, I think that it's really important to reach out to women through their kids because it's not that big of a step to go from being a soccer mom to, you know, a... Oh, my God. What is he doing? Sorry, I just... This is... Mike Pomeroy is having a nervous breakdown on air. That's kind of big news. ...a meal for their afternoon repast, something they could make using whatever ingredients - they had available. - Holy shit. I've been making frittata for about years now, ever since I was taught how to, on a naked weekend with a beautiful Italian movie star, who shall, of course, remain nameless. Occasionally, I make them at home. But only for people that I... People I really care about. Now the key to a great frittata is a very hot pan, because that, my friends, is what makes it... fluffy. We'll let this firm up a little bit. - Dash of pepper. - I'm sorry. I... You watchin' this? - Becky? - Yes, I... yeah. He is not gonna ask you twice. We'll give it a few seconds, then we'll pop it in the hot oven. Bye! Thanks! A little pepper. Stand by. He's goin' back to the oven. Ready three. A lot of people like a glass of di Gavi. Gavi di Gavi, perhaps. I, myself, like a... Barolo. I'll just free up the edges. Next week on the show, I'll show you how to make a fantastic beignet, which the rabble like to call... ...doughnuts. The old bastard. You know, he's still the third worst person in the world. Yeah, I know. That's good. That's really good. I want a tropical fruit plate. ""His gravity leavens the silliness of morning TV, making for an incongruous but somehow perfect match. Turns out that after years in the business, the real Mike Pomeroy has finally arrived."" Not bad. By the way, I'm getting my prostate checked next week. I thought I'd take a crew with me. - That's a great idea. We... - Jesus, I'm kidding. No, seriously, they have these little teeny, tiny cameras - that go right up your... - No, no, no. What if we got you a body double? - No! - No? Not in a thousand years."
12,2011,"Crazy, Stupid, Love.",American,"Cal Weaver is a middle-aged man who is told by his wife Emily that she has cheated on him with a co-worker, David Lindhagen, and wants a divorce. After moving into his own apartment, Cal goes to a bar night after night, talking loudly about his divorce, until he attracts the attention of a young man named Jacob Palmer, a womanizer who beds different women each night, although a young woman named Hannah has recently rejected his advances. Jacob takes pity on Cal, and offers to teach him how to pick up women. Using Jacob's teachings, Cal seduces Kate at the bar. After the encounter, Cal manages to successfully seduce other women in the bar. He sees Emily again at their son 13 year old Robbie's parent-teacher conference. The interaction goes well until they discover that Robbie's teacher is Kate, who reveals to Emily that she and Cal have slept together. Cal then confesses to sleeping with nine women since their separation. Emily leaves in disgust and begins actively dating David. Meanwhile, Hannah, a recent law school graduate, is expecting her boyfriend Richard to propose marriage while they celebrate her passing the bar exam, but he does not, instead, offering her a position at his law firm. Offended and hurt, Hannah returns to the bar where she originally rejected Jacob's advances and kisses Jacob passionately. The two return to Jacob's home to have sex, but end up talking to each other all night and making a connection. Jacob starts a relationship with Hannah, and he becomes distant from Cal.
At the same time, Robbie makes numerous grand gestures to try to win the heart of his 17-year-old babysitter, Jessica Riley, who actually has a crush on Cal. On the advice of her classmate Madison, she takes nude photos with raunchy expressions of herself to send to Cal and tucks them away in an envelope inside her dresser drawer. Later, Emily calls Cal under the guise of needing help with the house's pilot light, but Cal sees through the ruse since he is secretly gardening at the hold house in the night and sees that Emily didn't really need any help. Realizing that she called just because she too was missing him, Cal decides to try and win her back. Meanwhile, Jacob returns Cal's calls and asks for advice about being in a real relationship and meeting his girlfriend's parents. Jessica's mother, Claire, friends with Emily, who dislikes Cal, discovers Jessica's naked photos in the dresser drawer and shows them to Jessica's father, Bernie. Bernie was Cal's best friend before Claire made him end their friendship in the aftermath of the breakup. Bernie rushes to the Weaver residence to confront him about the photos, with Jessica in pursuit. Cal and his kids create a makeshift mini golf set in their backyard to remind Emily of their first date. During the gathering, Jacob and Hannah show up at the house, and Hannah is revealed to be Cal and Emily's first daughter born to them right out of high school. Cal is appalled that Jacob is dating his daughter, and forbids her to see him. At that moment, Bernie shows up and attacks Cal. Jessica arrives and tells her father that Cal knew nothing of the pictures. Then David arrives on the scene to return Emily's sweater from a previous date. Jacob asks David if his name is Lindhagen and when David replies ""yes,"" Jacob punches him in the face for the pain he caused Cal. Cal, Jacob, David, and Bernie then get into a scuffle which is soon broken up by the police. Cal starts spending time at the bar again and receives a visit from Jacob, who confesses that he is in love with Hannah. Cal replies that he is happy that Jacob is a changed man but does not approve of Jacob and Hannah's relationship, having seen Jacob's former lifestyle. Jacob resigns without harboring any ill feelings; rather, he expresses his respect for Cal and praises him for being a great father.
At Robbie's eighth grade graduation, Robbie is the salutatorian and gives a pessimistic speech about how he no longer believes in true love and soul-mates. Cal stops him and instead begins to recount his courtship with Emily to the audience, saying that, while he does not know if things will work out, he will never give up on Emily. With renewed faith, Robbie reaffirms his love for Jessica, to the audience's applause. After the ceremony, Cal gives Jacob and Hannah his blessing. Jessica gives Robbie an envelope containing the nude photos of herself that were originally intended for Cal to ""get him through high school."" Cal and Emily have a laugh talking about the events that have transpired the past year, hinting that they might get back together.",7.4,tt1570728,"CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE 2011 Oh, come on Save room for my love Save room for a moment to be with me Save room for my love Save a little Save a little for me Oh, I'm so full.

Where are your wallets? - I'm set for jeans. - You're not set for jeans. - These are fine. They're not fine. - You have a mom butt. - Why don't we just go to the Gap? You know what? They have a s...

God. - Yeah, probably. - Wha...? You would? That's... What? What are you even saying? You see what just happened, Cal? Soon as you opened your mouth, Tiffany started doubting whether she wanted to. That's the meanest thing anyone's ever said to me. No. This is. Your wife cheated on you because you lost sight of who you are as a man... ...as a husband, and probably as a lover. You're right, that's meaner. Let's talk about how many women you've been with. - Sexually? - Yeah, no. I mean break-dance fighting. One. No. Not at one time. How many total? Don't say it. Don't say it. We met in high school, okay? Oh, boy. You're kidding me. One woman? That's great. - Emily is beautiful. - I guess. She was gorgeous. She was one of those women... ...that could be wildly sexy and unbelievably cute all at the same time. We had a little blip senior year... I literally stopped listening at ""Emily. "" I think we should start approaching women tonight. Are you ready to go? I miss my wife. Hi. Hi. How are you? - Good. How are you? I'm great. I'm Jacob. What's your name? - Oh. Amy Johnson. - Amy Johnson. - I'm Jacob Palmer. How you doing? - Uh, great. Good. - I'm Cal. No. Not yet. - Sorry. Amy, can I buy you a drink? - Uh-huh. Keep her company? - I'd be happy to. - Lf he gets handsy, let me know. I wouldn't touch you if my life depended on it. - Uh, what was your name? - Cal Weaver. Cal Weaver. - No relation to Dennis Weaver. - Uh... Uh... - McCloud. McCloud was a show in the '70s that... You're not talking about McCloud again, are you? Here we go, huh? To all of our fallen homeys. Well, I'm the fourth of five sisters. - No. That's boring. - Oh. Not for your sisters, but for my purposes, it's not gonna work. - Okay. - I have this friend. And he thinks that you're way too pretty to be interesting and that's hogwash. - All right. You wanna get out of here? - Uh, sure. Giddyup. Am I boring you? I'm totally boring you. I'm... How are you doing this, like... ...wildly sexy but unbelievably cute thing that you're doing? Uh... - It's weird. - You wanna get out of here? - Yeah. - Okay. Cool. So Molly, who's at the time, can't find Mr. Bobo. We're looking all over. It's in the kitchen. Mr. Bobo was in the kitchen the whole time. Wanna get out of here?

Shit. - You have a second? - Hey, David. No. Because I'm swamped. You've been avoiding me. - No. I haven't. You ran in the other direction when you saw me coming down the hall yesterday. - You're very fast, by the way. - I ran track in high school. That must be it. Hey, listen, I'm sorry about you and Cal. - No, you're not. - No, I'm not. I like you, Emily. Do you have any idea how much I like you? Hey, David, you know, I really have a lot to do. I had no intention of falling for a married woman... ...but all of a sudden we're having lunch and I'm this accountant... ...who's waking up every morning excited to go to work. And that just does not happen for accountants. Ever. I checked with other accountants. David, you know what? You've been a great friend. You noticed last month when I got my hair trimmed and that was huge. But look, trust me. You know... I am saving you from disaster, because you're asking to pre-board the Titanic. Do you really want any part of this? Do I really want any part of this? - Emily? Your report's ready. - Okay. Okay, people. Here it is. The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. A romance set in Salem in the 1600s. It is about sin. Forced to wear the scarlet A to punish her adulterous behavior. Dimmesdale's A is inflicted upon himself in the form of a... Mr. Weaver. Mr. Weaver. Are we interrupting? You wanna talk about The Scarlet Letter, Ms. Tafferty? All right. Well, the A they're both wearing... ...I think it stands for ""asshole. "" Wanna know why? Because they fell in love... ...and love is for stupid assholes. And this book is just about a bunch of assholes... ...who fell in love, like assholes... ...then had to die, like assholes. I'm sorry about all the ""assholes. "" You know what else might work? A swear jar. You know, a quarter per curse word. Yeah, we'll definitely try that. All right. Could help. - Take care. - Thanks. - Seriously? - Sorry. Hey, I have to go back to the office. You're gonna have to wait for me there. Fine. They're still making kids read The Scarlet Letter, huh? Yep. You'd think somebody would have written something better by now. I guess I should take that down, huh? I guess. So how is he? You know. I mean, I... Oh, no. I'm sorry. Forget it. Just ignore me. - Forget I ever... - He's out a lot. - A lot? - Yeah. Like... Like ""a lot"" a lot, or just like a little? A lot. Well, that's good. That's really good. - Wanna get takeout tonight, honey? - I mean, he's sad. I can tell that he's sad. Even though he looks better... ...I can still tell that he's not happy, you know? Yeah. Well, you know. Yeah. I guess I'm pretty sad too. I know. I heard you crying the other night. Didn't know what to do. Oh, Robbie, baby, you're 13, you're not supposed to know what to do. I tried Googling it. - You did not. - Yep. I did. - Well, what did you Google? - I searched ""Mom crying in bed. "" What did Google say? Just a bunch of weird videos of moms in bed. Ugh. Oh, God. Okay. All right, that's enough. No more. Do those parental controls work at all? They work for me. Because you're a disgusting teenager, that's why. Hey. - Oh, hey. - Bill wants to see you before you take off. - Oh. Uh, David, this is my son, Robbie. Robbie, this is David. - Um, we work together. - How you doing, buddy? - You all right to wait a little bit? - Yeah. Okay. Thanks, David. So, Robbie, I hear you're quite the soccer player. So, David, I hear you broke up my parents' marriage. - You are David Lindhagen, right? - Lindhagen. - Yeah. Here's the thing, Lindhagen. - Hagen. Whatever. In the end, she winds up back with my dad. He's a better guy than you are in every category. And she still loves him. He's not gonna give up on my mom... ...like I'm not gonna stop sending Jessica messages... ...that make her feel uncomfortable. Hey. You ready to go, honey? - Can we order Chinese for dinner tonight? Yeah. Sure, honey. Hi, David. Get your stuff. - Bye, David. See you. You're not gonna be able to feel your arms. I'll be fine. Jesus Christ. Look, let's face it, Cal, all right? The war between the sexes is over, and we won, okay? We won the second women started doing pole dancing for exercise. But even though we won, they still deserve our respect. Make them feel beautiful, listen to their problems, open the door for them. Would you put on some clothes, please? - I'm sorry, is this bothering you? - No, it's not. My schwantz is in your face. If it's not bothering you, we got a problem. - Okay, it bothers me. - I don't care. You gotta take control of your manhood, pal. You know? You want something, you take it. You don't like something, you say it. I take what I want. David Lindhagen certainly took what he wanted, didn't he? And I can guarantee you this: He is opening the car door for your wife right now. What, you passing out? Oh, boy. - I think you're ready, pal. - For what? To talk to a pretty lady, and take her home and show her your gift. No. No, I'm not. You're ready as you're ever gonna be. You play your strengths, pal. That's all any of us can do. I'm mysterious. I'm, you know, good in bed. And you are a, uh... ...you know, stable and employed adult. Jesus. You see this lady over here at o'clock? You want me to hit on her? No, I wanna hit on her. The one behind her. Oh. She's a fox, right? Mm-hm. You think she came to a crowded bar to have a quiet drink alone? She's hunting. She's just looking for an opportunity to settle for a responsible and stable adult. And I'd like her to settle for you. Oh. Well, thank you for the ego boost, but you know what? Just because I've watched you pick up women... ...doesn't mean I know how to pick up women. - Ever see Karate Kid? - What does that have to do with anything? When he's teaching him to wax on and off but really to fight? You want me to fight someone? What's the first thing I do when I go up to a girl? I buy her a drink. Yes, always. Without fail. You buy her a drink. Even if she doesn't want one, you insist. - And do I talk about myself? - Never. Never about yourself, always her. - Because bar banter? - Is boring. So you put the impetus on her. She has to be the interesting one. ""Impress me. Impress me with how interesting you are. "" It's a big game. Game. Creepy, creepy little game you play. - That's judgmental, isn't it? - Mm-hm. At the end of the night do I ask them to come home? No, you tell them to come home. They have no choice in the matter. It is your choice and they are so overjoyed to have had the opportunity... ...to make sweet, sweet love to you. Oh, my God. You did, you Miyagi'd me. Honk. Take your ring off. Let's go. Just no talking about your kids, your job, David Lindhagen, don't you dare. Shut up, shut up. Just shut up. - Hello. Hi. Hi. Hi. - Who are you? - Hey. I'm Kate. - Kate, you mind if I introduce you to my...? - I'm Cal. - I got this. Pleased to meet you. - Hi. And this is my friend Jacob. He was just leaving. - Oh. - Oh.

What do you do, Kate? - I asked you first. - I asked you second. Seriously, what do you do? Seriously, what do you do? Are you really not going to tell me what you do? Ah... - Uh, okay, I'm a teacher. - Boring. Come on, you gotta keep it interesting. Interest me. Uh... - I studied at Oxford for five years. - Boring! Wow. Teacher with an alcohol dependency who studied at Oxford. Blah, blah, blah. Bleh. England. Yuck. I think my friends just got here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Okay, I'm in corporate insurance. - Oh, God. I have children, plural. My wife was cheating on me with Lindhagen... ...which I wasn't supposed to tell you. Nice to meet you. - What were you supposed to tell me? - I don't know. I don't know. I was supposed to say that you are the perfect combination of sexy and cute... ...which is actually something that I used to say to my wife. But now it's become corrupted. And I have layers of clothes on. I'm wearing a shirt and a tie and a sweater and a suede jacket... ...that just seals in all the heat. Seals in all the juices. It's all sweat under here. This is just sweat from here down. This sweater, this is called slim cut, but it feels like a scuba suit. And I'm looking at your breasts. What's that about? You think I'm the perfect combination of sexy and cute? That's what you picked up from what I just said? Mm, mm. - So this is my crappy apartment. - Oh. Ooh. Dumpy. That I had to move into after my wife left me. I love how you're being so honest. - You like that? - It's so different. It's so hot. Okay. Okay. Aah! Ha, ha. - Wow! Wow! - More. - Okay. Wanna hear something really hot? - Mm-hm. I've only had sex with one woman. In my entire life. - Honest or not honest? - That's honest. More! Tell me more. I'm a little worried you have AIDS. Just a little. Just a little bit. It's okay, I'm not worried. Oh, my God, this is so much fun. What do you wanna do with me? Oh... I wanna show you off to my ex-wife and make her really jealous. Whoa, man. Phew. Ha, ha. You gonna call me? Okay. Yeah. Wow, that is a great dress. Where'd you get that? Thank you. A store in Beverly Hills. Really? Beautiful. It was a gift from my grandmother. - Really? It's a Krugerrand. It's from South Africa. I love it. And I told him never to assume anything. And I've been to Maine, so that's a sixth state. So I've been to six states. - Oh, I love Maine. Oh, yeah, it's beautiful. - Have you been to Waterville? - I have, yeah. Greece, Italy. Greece, Italy? Wanna get out of here? - You're driving. - I am. I have never experienced that in my life. - Pretty great. - Are most women like that these days? - God bless technology. - God bless it. I went and met this girl the other night. She was heckling me the whole time we... I felt like I was doing it with the two old guys from The Muppet Show. - Ha-ha-ha. Statler and Waldorf. I was into it. And she was like, ""Look at this frown on your face. What is that? You're so serious. What, it's serious to kiss me? It's supposed to be fun. Oh, my God, if it's gonna be hard work, why don't you just stop?"" Hello? Hey. Hot guy from the bar who hit on you is here. Tsk. Liz, I'm studying. You should be studying the ceiling of his bedroom. I am eating a caramel apple. In what world, honey? Please, turn around. No. Come on, take a break. It'll be good for you to get out. And by get out... ...I mean have hot guy from the bar knock you into his headboard until you see God. What is wrong with you? You should be studying the curve of his... Okay, goodbye, Liz. That too much? Hello? Look, I gave him the cologne like you told me to... ...and I don't think we should really just dance on his grave. I just thought you'd wanna know what I heard about your old pal Cal. What about Mr. Weaver, Mom? Um, just, apparently, Mr. Weaver has become a real ladies' man. - What? - Claire. She should know. She babysits for him. She's almost an adult. Lots of young women in and out of his apartment. She's too young for this. I don't like this S-E-X talk in front of the K-I-D-S. First of all, they can spell. Second of all, I'm just saying. I think we were right in choosing Emily. Oh, um... - Why are you following me? Madison, I just had a question for you. Okay, Jessica, what's up? It's kind of on the personal side. Yep, my lips are: Seals. My lips are seals. Okay. Um... My question, and I don't mean to be blunt or insulting, but let's just call it what it is. You're always sleeping with older guys, right? - Always. Oh, um... So my question for you, Madison, is, um, how do you do that? I mean, how do you get them to see you as not just a kid in high school, you know? But as someone that's mature, and old, and that's... Well, first off, I have a huge rack. Uh, yes, you do. You don't have a huge rack. No. - Wait, how old is he? - Old. Like really old? - Like parent-old. - Nasty, Jessica. Yeah, because that's what I was thinking, right? Rock on. - Thank you. You are so dirty. - Yes, I know. Oh, okay. You gotta force his hand. You know what I mean? Go TMZ on his ass. - Not following. - A dirty picture. - Oh. Oh. - Make this face: - Jeez, Madison. Stop. What? You put that on his radar and he won't see you as a little girl anymore, that's for sure. - Hey, what's going on? - Hey. We don't know. Behold. Jessica Riley, you are my soul mate. - The love of my life. Ha-ha-ha. I have marked myself with a scarlet J for you, Jessica. Get down from there. Nathaniel Hawthorne... Are you mad? - I am your babysitter. You get down. Oh, my God. - What are you thinking? - Like the scaffold? Took me like four weeks to make it. It has wheels. This has got to stop, Robbie. - You'll learn to love me, I promise. - No, I won't. - Because I'm four years younger? - Because I love somebody else. Who is he? He's older. And I didn't want my parents to find out. You know I'll kill him if he hurts you. Yeah, I know. Okay, Robbie, this has to stop. Okay? No more. Grow up. I'll see you around. Unh. Okay. Okay. So you're seeing Mom tomorrow at my parent-teacher thing. Yeah, no biggie. What's with all the moping? Uh, nothing. It's just... There's a girl. - A girl, huh? - Uh-huh. You like her? I like Pringles. I mean, this girl... ...she's incredible. She's my soul mate, you know? She doesn't even care. But she's your soul mate, right? Yeah. Well, you just don't give up on her, right? Why not? You did. I didn't give up. Okay, it's more complicated than that. I'm a different guy now. You're not different. You just have different clothes. It's not that simple, kiddo. - What kind of crap is that? - Watch it. You love her or you don't. I know you do. I'm serious, Dad. I just need some inspiration right now. All right? Go get her back. Wow, how old are you? Wow. You look great, Cal. Oh. Ha, ha. Well, it turns out I've been buying the wrong size suit for like years, so... Oh, well, whatever. You, um... You look great. Thanks. You always look great. Oh, thanks. - So I spoke to Nanna yesterday. - Yeah, me too. How'd she sound to you? Um... Like Nanna. She worries about us. What teacher is this? Ms. Tafferty. She's the one he pulled the Scarlet Letter asshole routine on. Mm-hm. God, he's such a weird kid. - I kind of like him, though. - Mm-hm. Yeah, me too. Glad we switched babies at the hospital. Me too. That other one's in jail, probably. So how's it going with David? Oh, you know, it, um... It wasn't, um... That didn't mean anything. - I mean, you know, if... - No. No, I know. You seeing anybody? Me? Mm-mm. Oh, you know. Well, you hear things, you know, so... No. No. Not real... You know me. Yeah, well... No. I miss you, Em. I made an effort when we were younger, didn't I? I mean, miniature golf and dancing. You were such a great dancer. I had to be. You were such a good miniature golfer. I just... I don't know. I guess I got lazy. I got... I got boring, is what I got. No. And I'm so mad at you. I'm really mad at you for what you did. But I'm mad at myself too. Because I should not have jumped out of that car. I should've fought for you. Because you fight for your soul mates. Least, that's what my 13-year-old son tells me. He's a really strange kid. He scares the shit out of me. I miss you too. Mr. And Mrs. Weaver? No way in hell. - Cal, what are you doing here? - Oh, you two know each other? Yes. Yeah, right. We've met before, yes. - ""We have met before""? Seriously? Mm-hm. So I'd like to introduce you to my wife, Emily. Hi, I'm Robbie's mom. She's your wife again. How convenient. So shall we enter? - Okay. - Why don't we? Yeah, let's do that. I'm sorry. I'm playing catch-up. How do you two know each other, exactly? - Um... - Um... Maybe your husband should tell you. We... I think we met at last year's parent-teacher conference, wasn't it? Did I miss it? Did I miss the parent-teacher conference thing last year? Yeah. I don't remember. Why don't we just, uh, focus on Robbie? Yes. Yes, let's do that. Let's... Let's focus on Robbie. As you know, Robbie's shining moment... ...was when he set a school record for cursing in an eighth-grade English class. Asshole. Ha-ha-ha. You're familiar with this word, Mrs. Weaver. Yes, I am. And I've spoken to Principal... Asshole. As in someone who tells a woman that he'll call and never does. Hmm. Asshole. As in someone who uses honesty to get a woman into bed with him... ...but is actually full of shit like the rest of them. - This is not about Robbie. - Mm-mm. Asshole. As in someone who allows a woman to go downtown for minutes... ...because he's nervous. - All right, all right, all right. - Ew. Ew. Oh. You know what? Know what? No. Here's the deal. - She's an alcoholic. - Aah! Oh, God. Okay. That's... I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. God. I gotta go. Aah! - Oh, my God. Emily. God. - Emily, Emily, wait. - Leave me alone, Cal. I'm sober five years, asshole! Okay, yeah, I did. I did. I slept with our son's eighth-grade English teacher. I know. I know. And I cheated, so I have no right to be angry. Not the point. When we were married you were the only woman... ...that I had ever slept with... ...and now I have had sex with nine different women... God. Nine? Nine? Wow. You showed me. I wasn't trying to show you. I was trying to move on. But I don't want to. You've always been the only one. Tell her she's the perfect combination of sexy and cute, asshole. You said that to her? I did, yes. Who are you? I'm your soul mate. What a cliché. You, get over here. Come on. Yeah, yeah, give it up. Give it up for her. Aw. I'm so proud of you, baby. I had my doubts, of course. Hannah, I did tell you that tonight would be a special night if you passed the bar. So, Hannah... ...I would like to formally ask you... ...in front of all our friends and colleagues... ...if you would like to become... ...a permanent lawyer at the firm of Watkins, Goldberg and Schmidt? Huh? How about that? Ha, ha. To you. Whoo! What? - I ju... Um... What, what is it? I thought that you were gonna propose for some reason. What? - Yeah. I know. I'm just... It's just, uh, I'm a little thrown. I'm sorry. I didn't realize that you thought that we were there. Oh, no. God, no. Don't be silly. I just... I need some time, I think... ...to figure out how I feel about us, you know? Brrp. Long-term. You need some time? You need some time to figure out how you feel about us? Okay. Honey? - Wow. Ha-ha-ha. - Ha, ha. Wow. - Ahem. - Wow. Huh. Wow. This is actually really funny. I'm just... Next level. - Is this yours? Is this yours? Yes. Mm. Mm. Honey? - Is this gin?

You put on the perfect song, you make them a drink. And I knew And then you sleep together. That you Um... Yeah. I'm very nervous. I'm getting that. Okay. Because I know I seemed confident back at the bar... ...but that was mostly just because I was cold and wet... ...and trying to be dramatic a little bit. You're adorable. No. I am sexy. - I am R-rated sexy. - Mm-hm. Okay, I know what happens in the PG-13 version of tonight, all right? I know. It's that I get really drunk and then I pass out. You cover me with a blanket, kiss me on the cheek, nothing happens. But that's not why I'm here. I am here to bang the hot guy that hit on me at the bar. - Jacob. - Jacob. - Are people still saying ""bang""? - I do. We are gonna bang. Hmm? This is happening. - Take off your shirt. - Why?

Oh, God, this is ridiculous. I don't wanna do it. Come on. This is beyond ridiculous. - Run and jump. - No. - Yeah. Come on. - No, thank you. Thank God I'm drunk. Here we go. 'Cause I've had the time of my life And I owe it all to you I've been waiting for so long Now I've finally found someone To stand by me Ahem. So do you prefer to do it here or in the bedroom?

Could you do me a favor? - What? - Will you do me a kindness? Mm. Will you ask me something personal about myself? Hmm. Okay, fine. I'll do it. And then we bang. Yes. What's your mother like? My mom is very beautiful. Um... Very vain. Very smart. Cold. And your dad? Um... He died a long time ago. He was such a sweet guy. He was probably too sweet. Very successful in business. He made a lot of money, which is why I have all this stuff. But he was soft. Just too soft, too sensitive. And, you know, Dad, he couldn't really handle my mother... ...and didn't really make an effort. Hey, Jacob, it's Cal. Where are you? Remember the first woman I picked up, that teacher? Well, I have a story to tell you about her. It's been a week. I haven't heard from you. Should I be concerned? I am imagining you suffocating under a pile of women. Call me. Oh.

Wow. - I'd love to take you to the ballet. - You'd love to go to the ballet? I didn't say that. I'd love to take you to the ballet. I'd drop you off.

A pickle, if you will. - I got no one else to call. - Ha, ha. - I met a girl. - Oh, really? I'm spending all this time with her and she is a game changer. She's a game changer? No way. So much so I'm going to meet her mother right now. A mother and daughter. That's very Wilt Chamberlain-esque, even for you. - What is the matter with you? - Ha, ha. I don't know what to do. I need some advice. You might actually have to answer some personal questions about yourself. You gotta smile a lot. You've gotta be charming. Definitely don't be yourself. That's what you've got for me, don't be myself? - Ha-ha-ha. - Great. Thanks for nothing. Do you wanna get a? Do you wanna get a beer next week? You have my number.

Daddy, Daddy, Daddy. No, leave him. Let him go. He can handle it. Let him go. Honey! Get out of my purse. Stay out of my purse! Do not take those keys! Do not take those keys! I'm not letting you take those keys. You're not following your father! Stop it! No! No! Let your father handle it. You're not to see that man again! That man's a pervert! - Stay out of it! - No! Is that pervert sexting you? Hey, baby. What are you wearing? Dad's here. I have to blindfold you. - Why? What's he doing? - Just come on. Hate this. Bad. Is this something I'm gonna have to clean up? Mom, no, don't worry about it. Keep going. Honey, honey, I really can't see. Mom, I got you. Two. Right now we're on the ground. One more step. - Three. - Three. Yay. Mom, no more steps. We're on the ground. Mom, relax. It's your husband, not al Qaeda. Hi, Em. Oh, hey. Can I take this off now, please? - Nope, not yet. - Oh, what's this? - I hear you, gigglepuss. - Do it. May I have your attention? Many years ago, in the hallway of Woodside Middle School... ...Cal Weaver saw Emily Boyle for the first time. Cal, are you seriously gonna do this in front of the kids? Mm-hm. If anything goes wrong I'm supposed to take her upstairs and put the TV on loud. All right. Well, we may as well wait for your daughter. - She's right here. - No, no, no. I mean our other daughter. Hello? - Nanna. - Hi, guys. Hi, sweetheart. Hi. What's going on? Oh, I don't know. Some game. He won't let me take this dumb blindfold off. - Cal? - Is that him? What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - Wait, do you guys know each other? - What's going on? - What are you doing here? Hey, Nanna. - Hi, Robbie. - Hey, Nanna. - Hi, cutie. Jacob, it's so nice to meet you. I've heard so many wonderful things about you from Nanna. - I'm sorry, what's a Nanna? I am. I couldn't say Hannah. How do you know my dad? She couldn't say her H's at all. Okay. I'm having trouble understanding what's going on right now. - Dad, this is Jacob, my boyfriend. No, it's not. - I was bringing him over to meet Mom. - No. No. No, no, no. I wanna see the boyfriend. - I can't breathe. Can I take this off? Cal, what are you doing with a daughter that's grown up? I was 17. That's why we had to get married so young. - You should have told me. - Never wanted me to talk about my children. - Um, I'm gonna go watch TV now. - That's fine. Why don't you go do that? - Yeah. Can I come? - No. So you guys, like, really know each other, then. Oh, screw it. This is ridiculous. - Honey, he's really cute. - No, he's not. Look at you. You're really a mother? I don't believe it, sister. Let me get this straight. So you guys are a thing. You guys are a couple, right? You guys are together? - Yeah. - No way. Break up right now. - Daddy? - Please don't call him that. - Cal, that's not gonna happen. - Then I will mess you up. - Dad. - Cal. - Cal. - Jessica? Bernie? Daddy, no. I let her babysit for you, you son of a bitch. - She's only years old. - What are you talking about? - Oh, God. No idea what you're talking about. - Aah! Bernie. Daddy, no. No, no, no. Stop it. Dad. Jacob! Oh, God. Stop it. He didn't do anything. - He doesn't know. Is your back okay? - Know what? - Know what? Is this some kind of a skit? Because I'm lost. - Argh! No. - Aah! No, no, no. Daddy, Daddy. He didn't even know that I'm in love with him. - With who? With him. - You pointing at me? - You pointing at him? She's pointing at him? Oh. Wait. My dad is the older guy you've been seeing? - I knew it. You... - He doesn't know about the naked photos. - What? - Jessica. You made him naked photos? Seriously? - I'm gonna beat you till your brains fall out. - Timeout, timeout. Hold on. - But I love her. - Jessica's the one you're in love with? Excuse me, Emily? - You left your sweater in my car. - Oh. - Who are you? - David Lindhagen. - David Lindhagen? - David Lindhagen. Okay. - Is this a bad time? - Yeah. - Unh. - Jacob. Know how much pain and suffering you caused my friend? - Stay the hell away from my daughter. - Ow. You stay away from my daughter. - I don't even know you. Stop it. Oh, my God. That is not... What are you grabbing? Really? Really? - Come on. Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! Come on, she's my daughter. Stop it. Stop it. I'll kill you. So... Okay, wait. Which one of you is Lindhagen again? Hagen. I'm just gonna write, ""Domestic disturbance, all clear. "" Thank you, officer. Just simmer down, okay? We all have arguments. But if you're gonna fight, just do it inside. Keep it in the family, okay? I will kill you. Let's go. - Daddy? Now. - Daddy? - Now. Cal. Come on. Honey. This guy is a lowlife, he is a womanizer. - That's ironic. - Excuse me? I know him. I have witnessed him in action. - And you are not to see him anymore. - Dad, I'm not gonna stop seeing him. Okay. Okay. Well, then we have nothing more to talk about. - You're being unreasonable. - Get out of my house. This is not your house anymore. Well, you made damn sure of that, didn't you, sweetheart? - Bye, Nanna. - Bye, cutie. She's all yours, David. - Fantastic. - Nice. Go big or go home, right, bud? Go home, Dad. Did you see the headline today? What? It says that you should call your dad. No, it says, ""Let's move on child obesity. "" Ha, ha. No, it doesn't. I'm not gonna call him. - No, it says you really should. Can I get you another? - What time is it? 2:30. In the afternoon. ""Two-thirty"" would have been sufficient... ...but thank you for the judgmental tone, cocktail servant. I'm sorry... Sorry for being a dick. Nice sweat suit. What do you want? - Uh, can I sit down? - I don't know, can you? Are we gonna be adults about this, or we gonna...? ""Are we gonna be adults about this?"" - It would mean a lot to me if we could talk. - Are you still seeing my daughter? - Yes. - Then I have nothing to say to you. Been hanging out here a lot? Sometimes. You been missing a lot of work? - I have a lot of vacation days. You know what? You have a lot of nerve. Do you wanna do your shot? She probably spit in it, so, no, thank you. Your kids miss you, Cal. You're hanging out with my kids? That's great. Teach Robbie how to objectify women. He'll love that. You know it's his eighth-grade graduation next week. You gonna go to that? Of course I'm going. I just didn't know. You haven't really been around. I don't think he knows either. I haven't been around for him? That's what you're telling me? You know, he's not my biggest fan right now. - He thinks I stole his soul mate. - He worships you, Cal. - Is the parental advice over? Because if so... - I'm in love with her. I love her. I don't know what I was doing before this. And I don't know what to do about it. It's not something I can really stop. - Yeah? Yeah. - You love her? You love Hannah? Yes. Tell me about it. Tell me how much you love her. I'm just... Look, Cal, it's not something that I wanted, okay? I looked at people who were in love... ...and I thought the way that they were behaving... ...and the things that they were doing and saying... ...they appeared pathetic, honestly. And I spent all this time with you, I'm trying to make you more like me... ...and it turns out I just wanna be... I need that drink. You gonna make me do this? I gotta really do this? I had Hannah when I was 17. I taught her how to ride a bike. I taught her how to drive a car. And I'm glad for you. I'm happy for you, that you've changed. I think it's fantastic that you're a better man. But I've seen too much already. - No. I know. I know too much. I know. I know. And it's Hannah. And she's too good for you. I agree. I'm never gonna give you my approval. You're a good dad, Cal. Yep. Yep. She spit. She spit in that. Guys, I need you to pay attention. Do not cut the line. I need everyone to stay in your positions, okay? Guys, check your ties. Make sure everything is nice and neat. Ladies, when you're on stage... Mommy, look. Robbie's name. Excuse me. Is this open? How close? - Yeah, that's fine. Good afternoon. Welcome, parents, family and friends. We're so pleased to have you here to celebrate this graduating class. And now, to introduce our first student speaker... ...our very own Kate Tafferty. - She's pretty. - Ugh. Our first speaker is not only the class salutatorian... ...but is also... ...one of the most spirited young men... ...I've ever had the pleasure of teaching. Ladies and gentlemen, Robbie Weaver. - Whoo! - Robbie! Welcome, class of 2011. Our time as middle schoolers has come to an end. We can't fight it anymore. We're getting old. All my life I wanted to grow up. I wanted to grow older so people would take me seriously. It all sounded so good to me. Growing up, getting a job, getting married. But... ...it's all a scam. And love? That's the biggest scam of all. I was in love. And I know that makes some of you laugh because I'm only 13... ...but whatever. I was. And I used to think, and really believe... ...that there was one true love for everyone... ...and if you fought hard enough for that person... ...your one true love would always work out. It sounded good to me when I was younger, but it just doesn't work that way. - There is no such thing as one true love... - Stop. Shit. - Oh, boy. - Okay. All right. Ahem. Excuse me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - What are you doing? - What are you doing? I was wrong, Dad. There's no such thing as... I, uh... Um... Oh. Well, here's the thing: My son's graduation speech sucks. That's not a joke. In fairness, I didn't know where he was going with that. But I think we can all agree... ...it was headed in a kind of depressing, um, way. My son... Not him, my actual son. - Believes in grand romantic gestures. He believes in the existence... ...of one's soul mate. And it's easy to just look at a 13-year-old and say: ""You don't know what you're talking about. You are wrong. "" But I'm not so sure. I met my soul mate when I was years old. We went out for ice cream. After, my dad started teasing me about my first date, the way dads do. And I told him, ""Dad, it's no big deal. I'm gonna be going out with a lot of different girls on a lot of different dates. "" And that is the first time that I ever lied to my father. I met my soul mate when I was years old... ...and I have loved her every minute of every day... ...since I first bought her that mint chocolate chip cone. I have loved her through the birth of my three perfect children. I have loved her even when I've hated her. Only married couples will understand that one. And I don't know if it's gonna work out. I don't know what's gonna happen. I'm sorry, Robbie, I can't give you that. But I can promise you this: I will never stop trying. Because when you find the one... ...you never give up. Do you have anything you'd like to say? I still love you, Jessica. And I love you, Emily. I loved you ever since you first changed my sister's diaper. I loved you when you came into my bedroom and I was under the covers... - Stop him. No, no. - What's he talking about? - I'm not ashamed of it. Okay, we're good, we're good. Oh, there's your mom. Let's go say hi. Hey. Oh, I'm so proud of you. There she is. My perfect girl. Hi. Okay. So I bought a firearm... ...from a shady Internet site... ...and I am prepared to shoot you with it. Come here. Take care of her. This is gonna be fun. This is gonna be fun. I'm gonna talk to my friends. Go hang with the other high schoolers. Go ahead, see if I care. I don't care. I'm really glad you came. So am I. You were a really good babysitter, Jessica. I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable. - I thought you weren't giving up. I'm not. But I just figure... ...you like my dad... ...and in a few years I'll look like him. I'll come for you then. That's not a bad plan. But... Well, until then... ...just a little graduation gift to get you through high school. Thanks. So... Can you...? - Why...? - Take care, Robbie. Holy crap. - He looks pretty happy. - Yeah. - God, I hate that haircut, though. - Ick. - I know. He looks like a sheepdog. - Mm-hm. Oh, my eyes! My eyes! My eyes! It's been a really hard year. How so? Yeah, there were a couple little blips, I guess. - I know. - I guess I just, you know... Really what I want to say... ...is that I'm so glad you bought me that ice cream. Me too."
13,2001,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,American,"In the Second Age of Middle-earth, the lords of Elves, Dwarves, and Men are given Rings of Power. Unbeknownst to them, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring in Mount Doom, infusing into it a great part of his power to dominate, through it and at a distance, the other Rings, so he might conquer Middle-earth. A final alliance of men and elves battles Sauron’s forces in Mordor, where Prince Isildur of Gondor severs Sauron's finger, and the Ring with it, thereby destroying his physical form. Unfortunately, the Ring's influence corrupts Isildur, and, rather than destroy the Ring, Isildur takes it for himself. Isildur is later killed by Orcs, and the Ring is lost for 2,500 years, until it is found by Gollum, who owns it for five centuries. The Ring is then found by a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.
Sixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the Shire, reuniting with his old friend, Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo reveals that he intends to leave the Shire for one last adventure, and he leaves his inheritance, including the Ring, to his nephew, Frodo. Although Bilbo has begun to become corrupted by the Ring and tries to keep it for himself, Gandalf intervenes. Gandalf, suspicious of the Ring, tells Frodo to keep it secret and to keep it safe. Gandalf then investigates the Ring, discovers its true identity, and returns to warn Frodo. Gandalf also learns that Gollum was tortured by Orcs, and that Gollum uttered two words during his torture: ""Shire"" and ""Baggins."" Gandalf instructs Frodo to leave the Shire, accompanied by his gardener Samwise Gamgee. Gandalf rides to Isengard to meet with fellow wizard Saruman the White, but learns that he has joined forces with Sauron, who has unleashed the Ringwraiths to find Frodo. After a brief battle, Saruman imprisons Gandalf. Frodo and Sam are joined by fellow Hobbits, Merry and Pippin, and they evade the Ringwraiths, arriving in Bree, where they are meant to meet Gandalf. However, Gandalf never arrived, and they are instead aided by a ranger named Strider, a friend of Gandalf's, who escorts them to Rivendell.
The Hobbits are ambushed by the Ringwraiths, and one stabs Frodo with a cursed Morgul blade. Arwen, an elf and Strider’s lover, comes to Frodo’s aid and successfully takes him to Rivendell, where he is healed. Frodo meets Gandalf, who escaped Isengard on the back of a giant Eagle. Arwen’s father, Lord Elrond, holds a council that decides the Ring must be destroyed in Mount Doom. While the members argue, Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, elf Legolas, dwarf Gimli, Boromir of Gondor, and Strider, who is revealed to be Aragorn, Isildur’s heir and the rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo gives Frodo his sword, Sting. The Fellowship of the Ring sets off, but Saruman’s magic forces them to travel through the Mines of Moria, much to Gandalf's displeasure.
The Fellowship discovers that the dwarves within Moria have been slain, and they are attacked by Orcs and a cave troll. They defeat them, but are confronted by an ancient demon called a Balrog. Gandalf casts the Balrog into a vast chasm, but it drags Gandalf down into the darkness with it. The rest of the Fellowship, now commanded by Aragorn, reaches Lothlórien, home to elves Galadriel and Celeborn. Galadriel privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the quest, and that one of his friends will try to take the Ring. Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of Uruk-hai to track down and kill the Fellowship.
The Fellowship leaves Lothlórien by river to Parth Galen. Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who tries to take the Ring in desperation. Afraid of the Ring corrupting his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone. The Fellowship is then ambushed by the Uruk-hai. Merry and Pippin are taken captive, and Boromir is mortally wounded by the Uruk chieftain. After slaying the chieftain, Aragorn watches Boromir die peacefully. Sam follows Frodo, accompanying him to keep his promise to Gandalf to protect Frodo, while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli go to rescue Merry and Pippin.",8.8,tt0120737,"I amar prestar aen. The world is changed. Han mathon ne nen. I feel it in the water. Han mathon ne chae. I feel it in the earth. A han noston ned 'wilith. I smell it in the air. Much that once was... ...is lost. For none now live who remember it. The Lord of the Rings. It began with the forging of the great rings. Three were given to the elves: Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the dwarf-lords: Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine... ...nine rings were gifted to the race of men... ...who, above all else, desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived. For another ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom... ... the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master ring... ... to control all others. And into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice... ...and his will to dominate all life. One ring to rule them all. One by one... ... the free lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the ring. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor. And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-earth. Tangado haid! Hold positions! Leithio i philinn! Fire the arrows! Victory was near. But the power of the ring... ...could not be undone. It was in this moment... ... when all hope had faded... ... that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's sword. Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples of Middle-earth, was defeated. The ring passed to Isildur... ... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. But the hearts of men... ...are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur... ... to his death. And some things that should not have been forgotten... ...were lost. History became legend... ...legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years... ... the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came... ...it ensnared a new bearer. My precious. The ring came to the creature Gollum... ... who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. It came to me. My own. My love. My own. My precious. The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East... ... whispers of a nameless fear. And the ring of power perceived... ...its time had now come. It abandoned Gollum. But something happened then the ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. What's this? A hobbit. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire. A ring. Lost! The 22nd day of September... My precious is lost! For the time will soon come... ... when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all. ...in the year 1400... ...by Shire-reckoning. Bag End, Bagshot Row. Hobbiton, Westfarthing... ...the Shire... ...Middle-earth. The third age of this world. The Fellowship of the Ring. There and back again. A Hobbit's tale. By Bilbo Baggins. Now... ...where to begin? Ah, yes.... ""Concerning... ...Hobbits."" Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire... ...for many hundreds of years... ...quite content to ignore and be ignored... ...by the world of the big folk. Middle-earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count... ...Hobbits must seem of little importance... ...being neither renowned as great warriors... ...nor counted among the very wise. Frodo! Someone at the door. In fact, it has been remarked by some... ... that Hobbits' only real passion is for food. A rather unfair observation... ...as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales... ...and the smoking of pipe-weed. But where our hearts truly lie... ...is in peace and quiet... ...and good, tilled earth. For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow. And yes, no doubt to others our ways seem quaint. But today of all days. It is brought home to me... It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life. Frodo, the door! Sticklebacks. Where is that boy? Frodo! Down from the door where it began And I must follow if I can The road goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began Now far ahead the road has gone And I must follow if I can - You're late. A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to. It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf! You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday? How is the old rascal? I hear it's going to be a party of special magnificence. You know Bilbo. He's got the whole piece in an uproar. Well, that should please him. Half the Shire's been invited. And the rest of them are turning up anyway. And so life in the Shire goes on... ... very much as it has this past age. Full of its own comings and goings, with change coming slowly. If it comes at all. For things are made to endure in the Shire... ...passing from one generation to the next. There's always been a Baggins living here under the Hill... ...in Bag End. And there always will be. To tell you the truth, Bilbo's been a bit odd lateIy. I mean, more than usual. He's taken to locking himself in his study. He spends hours and hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking. Where's it gone? He's up to something. - All right, then. Keep your secrets. - What? But I know you have something to do with it. Good gracious me. Before you came along, we Bagginses were very well thought of. Indeed. Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected. If you're referring to the incident with the dragon. I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door. Whatever you did, you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace. Oh, really? Gandalf! Gandalf! Fireworks, Gandalf! - Gandalf! - Fireworks, Gandalf! Gandalf? - I'm glad you're back. - So am I, dear boy. So am I. No, thank you! We don't want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations! And what about very old friends? Gandalf? - Bilbo Baggins. - My dear Gandalf! Good to see you. years old! Who would believe it? You haven't aged a day. Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome. Oh, here we are. Tea...or maybe something a littIe stronger? I've got a few bottles of the old winyard left - 1296. Very good year. Almost as old as I am. It was laid down by my father. What say we open one, eh? Just tea, thank you. I was expecting you sometime last week. Not that it matters. You come and go as you please. Always have and always will. You caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid. We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle.... There's some cheese here. No, that won't do. We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart.... But not much for afters. Oh, no, we're all right. I've just found some sponge cake. I could make you some eggs if you'd li... - Just tea, thank you. - Oh, right. - You don't mind if I eat, do you? - No, not at all. Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins! I'm not at home! It's the Sackville-Bagginses. - I know you're in there! - They're after the house. They've never forgiven me for living this long. I've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day... ...never giving me a moment's peace. I want to see mountains again. Mountains, Gandalf! And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea. - So you mean to go through with your plan? - Yes, yes. It's all in hand. All the arrangements are made. Oh, thank you. Frodo suspects something. Of course he does. He's a Baggins... ...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle. You will tell him, won't you? - Yes, yes. - He's very fond of you. I know. He'd probably come with me if I asked him. I think in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire. The woods, the fields. Little rivers. I am old, Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. I feel thin. Sort of stretched... ...like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday. A very Long holiday. And I don't expect I shall return. In fact, I mean not to. Old Toby. The finest weed in the Southfarthing. Gandalf, my old friend... ...this will be a night to remember. Hello, hello. Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you. Welcome, welcome. Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance. - I think I'll just have another ale. - Oh, no, you don't. Go on! So there I was... ...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls. And they were all arguing amongst themselves... ...about how they were going to cook us. Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit on us one by one, squash us into jelly. They spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors... ...that the sun's first light crept over the top of the trees... ...and turned them all to stone! Quickly. Up they go! No no, the big one - big one Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you. Welcome, welcome. Are all these children yours? Good gracious, you have been productive. Bilbo? Sackville-Bagginses! Quickly, hide! Thank you, my boy. You're a good lad, Frodo. I'm very selfish, you know. Yes, I am. Very selfish. I don't know why I took you in after your mother and father died... ...but it wasn't out of charity. I think it was because... ...of all my numerous relations... ...you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit. Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew? No. Well, yes, but that's not the point. The point is, Frodo... ...you'll be all right. - Done! - You're supposed to stick it in the ground. - It is in the ground. - Outside! This was your idea. Bilbo. Bilbo, watch out for the dragon! Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon in these parts for thousands of years. - That was good. - Let's get another one. Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took. I might've known. Speech, Bilbo! Speech! Speech! My dear Bagginses and Boffins... ...Tooks and Brandybucks... ...Grubbs, Chubbs... ...Hornblowers... ...Bolgers... ...Bracegirdles... ...and Proudfoots. - Proudfeet! Today is my 111th birthday! Happy birthday! But alas, eleventh-one years is far too short a time to live among... ...such excellent and admirable Hobbits. I don't know half of you half as well as I should like... ...and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. I have things to do. I've put this off for far too long. I regret to announce this is the end! I'm going now. I bid you all a very fond farewell. Goodbye. I suppose you think that was terribly clever. Come on, Gandalf. Did you see their faces? There are many magic rings in this world, Bilbo Baggins... ...and none of them should be used lightly. It was just a bit of fun. Oh, you're probably right, as usual. - You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you? - Two eyes. As often as I can spare them. - I'm leaving everything to him. - What about this ring of yours? - Is that staying too? - Yes, yes. It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece. No. Wait, it's... ...here in my pocket. Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now? Yet, after all, why not? - Why shouldn t I keep it? - I think you should leave the ring behind. Is that so hard? Well, no. And yes. Now it comes to it, I don't feel l ike parting with it. It's mine. I found it! It came to me! - There's no need to get angry. - Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's mine. My own. - My precious. - Precious? It's been called that before, but not by you. What business is it of yours what I do with my own things? I think you've had that ring quite long enough. - You want it for yourself! - Bilbo Baggins! Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks. I am not trying to rob you. I'm trying to help you. All your long years, we've been friends. Trust me as you once did. Let it go. You're right, Gandalf. The ring must go to Frodo. It's late. The road is long. Yes, it is time. Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket. I've thought up an ending for my book: ""And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days."" And I'm sure you will, my dear friend. Goodbye, Gandalf. Goodbye, dear Bilbo. The road goes ever on and on... Until our next meeting. It's mine. My own. My precious. Riddles in the dark. Bilbo! Bilbo! My precious. Precious. He's gone, hasn't he? He talked for so long about leaving... ...I didn't think he'd really do it. Gandalf? Bilbo's ring. He's gone to stay with the elves. He's left you Bag End. Along with all his possessions. The ring is yours now. - Put it somewhere out of sight. - Where are you going? - There are some things that I must see to. - What things? - Questions. Questions that need answering. - You've only just arrived. I don't understand. Neither do I. Keep it secret. Keep it safe. Shire! Baggins! ""The year of the second age. Here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor... ...and the finding of the ring of power."" ""It has come to me. The one ring. It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom. All those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate... ...for I will risk no hurt to the ring. It is precious to me... ...though I buy it with great pain. The markings upon the band begin to fade. The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared. A secret now that only fire can tell."" Shire... ...Baggins. There's no Bagginses around here. They're all up in Hobbiton. That way. ""Hey ho to the dock I go To heal my heart and drown my woe Rain may fall and wind may blow But there still be... ...many miles to go Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain And the stream that falls from hill to plain Better than rain or rippling brook Is a mug of beer inside this Took!"" There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire. Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature. War is brewing. The mountains are fair teeming with goblins. Far-off tales and children s stories, that's all that is. You're beginning to sound like that old Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was. Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking. And proud of it. - Cheers, Gaffer. - Aye. Cheers. Weel it's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders. Keep your nose out of trouble, and no trouble'll come to you. - Good night, lads. - Good night. Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale. Mind who you're sweet-taking. Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one. Does she? - Good night, Sam. - Good night, Mr. Frodo. Is it secret? Is it safe? What are you doing? Hold out your hand, Frodo. It's quite cool. What can you see? Can you see anything? Nothing. There's nothing. Wait. There are markings. It's some form of Elvish. I can't read it. There are few who can. The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here. Mordor! In the common tongue, it says: ""One ring to rule them all... ...One ring to find them... ...One ring to bring them all... ...and in the darkness bind them."" This is the One ring... ...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. Taken by IsiIdur from the hand of Sauron himself. Bilbo found it. - In Gollum's cave. - Yes. For years, the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping... ...prolonging his life, delaying old age. But no longer, Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has awoken. It's heard its master's call. But he was destroyed. Sauron was destroyed. No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron endured. His life force is bound to the ring, and the ring survived. Sauron has returned. His orcs have multiplied. His fortress at Barad-dûr is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness. He is seeking it. Seeking it - All his thought is bent on it. For the ring yearns above all else... ...to return to the hand of its master. They are one... ...the ring and the Dark Lord. Frodo... ...he must never find it. All right. We put it away. We keep it hidden. We never speak of it again. No one knows it's here, do they? Do they, Gandalf? There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the ring. I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum. But the enemy found him first. I don't know how long they tortured him. But amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words: Shire! Baggins! Shire. Baggins. But that would lead them here! Who goes there? Take it, Gandalf! - Take it! - No, Frodo. - You must take it! - You cannot offer me this ring! - I'm giving it to you! - Don't tempt me, Frodo! I dare not take it. Not even to keep it safe. Understand, Frodo... ...I would use this ring from a desire to do good. But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine. - But it cannot stay in the Shire! - No. No, it can't. What must I do? - You must leave. And leave quickly. - Where? Where do I go? Get out of the Shire. Make for the village of Bree. Bree. - What about you? - I'll be waiting for you... ...at the inn of the Prancing Pony. - And the ring will be safe there? - I don't know, Frodo. I don't have any answers. I must see the head of my order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo. He'll know what to do. You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you. That name is not safe outside the Shire. Travel only by day. And stay off the road. I can cut across country easily enough. My dear Frodo. Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month. And yet, after a hundred years... ...they can still surprise you. Get down. Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee! Have you been eavesdropping? I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest. I was just cutting the grass under the window there...If you follow me. A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think? - I heard raised voices. - What did you hear? Speak! Nothing important. That is, I heard a good deal about a ring, and a Dark Lord... ...and something about the end of the world but... Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me. Don't turn me into anything unnatural. No? Perhaps not. I've thought of a better use for you. Come along, Samwise. Keep up. Be careful, both of you. The enemy has many spies in his service: Birds, beasts. Is it safe? Never put it on... ...for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power. Always remember, Frodo... ...the ring is trying to get back to its master. It wants to be found. This is it. This is what? If I take one more step... ...it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been. Come on, Sam. Remember what Bilbo used to say: - ""It's a dangerous business, Frodo."" - ""Going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet... ... there's no knowing where you might be swept off to."" Sam. Wood-elves. They're going to the harbor beyond the White Towers. To the Grey Havens. They're leaving Middle-earth. Never to return. I don't know why... ...it makes me sad. Everywhere I lie there's a dirty great root sticking into my back. Just shut your eyes... ...and imagine you're back in your own bed... ...with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow. It's not working, Mr. Frodo. I'm never going to be able to sleep out here. Me neither, Sam. Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom. The hour grows late. And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard... ...seeking my counsel. For that is why you have come, is it not? My old friend. Saruman. - You are sure of this? - Beyond any doubt. So the ring of power has been found. All these long years, it was in the Shire. - Under my very nose. - Yet you did not have the wit to see it. Your love of the halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind. But we still have time. Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly. Time? What time do you think we have? Sauron has regained much of his former strength. He cannot yet take physical form... ...but his spirit has lost none of its potency. Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh. You know of what I speak, Gandalf. A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. The eye of Sauron. He is gathering all evil to him. Very soon, he'll have summoned an army... ...great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth. You know this? How? I have seen it. A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman. Why? Why should we fear to use it? They are not all accounted for, the lost seeing-stones. We do not know who else may be watching. The hour is later than you think. Sauron's forces are already moving. The Nine have left Minas Morgul. The Nine? They crossed the river Isen on Midsummer's Eve... ...disguised as riders in black. - They've reached the Shire? - They will find the ring. And kill the one who carries it. Frodo! You did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron? There are none who can. Against the power of Mordor... ...there can be no victory. We must join with him, Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It would be wise, my friend. Tell me... ...friend... ...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness? I gave you the chance of... ...aiding me willingly... ...but you have elected the way of pain! Mr. Frodo? Frodo? Frodo! - I thought I'd lost you. - What are you taking about? - It's just something Gandalf said. - What did he say? ""Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."" And I don't mean to. Sam, we're still in the Shire. What could possibly happen? Frodo. - Merry, it's Frodo Baggins. - Hello, Frodo. Get off him. Come on, Frodo. What's the meaning of this? You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop! You get back here! Get out of my field! You'll know the devil if I catch up with you! I don't know why he's so upset. It's only a couple of carrots. And some cabbages. And those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week. - And then the mushrooms the week before. - Yes, Pippin. My point is... ...he's clearly overreacting. Run! Oh, that was close. I think I've broken something. Trust a Brandybuck and a Took! What? That was just a detour. A short cut. - Short cut to what? - Mushrooms! That's mine. That's nice, Merry. Here's a nice one, Sam. I think we should get off the road. Get off the road! Quick! Be quiet! What was that? Anything? Nothing. What is going on? That Black Rider was looking for something. Or someone. Frodo? Get down! I have to leave the Shire. Sam and I must get to Bree. Right. Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me. Run! This way! Follow me! Run! Get the rope, Sam! Frodo! Run, Frodo! Go! - Hurry! Frodo, come on! - Come on! Faster! - Jump! - How far to the nearest crossing? - The Brandywine Bridge. miles. Come on. - What do you want? - We're heading for the Prancing Pony. Hobbits. Four hobbits! What's more, out of the Shire by your talk. What business brings you to Bree? We wish to stay at the inn. Our business is our own. All right young sir, I meant no offense. It's my job to ask questions after nightfall. There's talk of strange folk abroad. Can't be too careful. Out of the way! Watch where you're walking. Excuse me. Good evening, little masters. What can I do for you? If you're looking for accommodation, we got some nice cozy hobbit-sized rooms available. Always proud to cater to little folk, Mister...? Underhill. My name's Underhill. - Underhill, yeah. - We're friends of Gandalf the Grey. - Can you tell him we've arrived? - Gandalf? Gandalf. Oh, yes... ...I remember. Elderly chap. Big grey beard, pointy hat. Not seen him for six months. What do we do now? Sam... ...he'll be here. He'll come. Get out of my way! What's that? This, my friend, is a pint. It comes in pints? - I'm getting one. - You got a whole half already! That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived. Excuse me. That man in the corner. Who is he? He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous folk they are, wandering the wilds. What his right name is, I've never heard, but 'round here he's known as Strider. Strider. Baggins... Baggins... Baggins... Baggins... Baggins... Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins. He's over there. Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin, once removed on his mother's side... ...and my third cousin, twice removed.... - Pippin! - Steady on, Frodo. You cannot hide. I see you. There is no life... ...in the void. Only... ...death. You draw far too much attention to yourself, ""Mr. Underhill."" What do you want? A little more caution from you. That is no trinket you carry. - I carry nothing. - Indeed. I can avoid being seen if I wish... ...but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift. - Who are you? - Are you frightened? Yes. Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you. Let him go! Or I'll have you, Longshanks. You have a stout heart, little hobbit. But that will not save you. You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo. They're coming. What are they? They were once men. Great kings of men. Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed, they took them without question. One by one, falling into darkness. Now they are slaves to his will. They are the Nazgûl. Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead. At all times they feel... ... the presence of the ring... ...drawn to the power of the One. They will never stop hunting you. - Where are you taking us? - Into the wild. How can we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf? I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer... ...and feel fouler. - He's foul enough. We have no choice but to trust him. - But where is he leading us? - To Rivendell, Master Gamgee. - To the house of Elrond. - Did you hear that? Rivendell. We're going to see the elves. - Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall. - What about breakfast? - You've already had it. - We've had one, yes. What about second breakfast? Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip. What about elevenses? Luncheon? Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper? - He knows about them, doesn't he? - I wouldn't count on it. Pippin! What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit? ""Tinúviel elvanui Tinúviel the elven-fair Elleth alfirin ethelhael Immortal maiden elven-wise O hon ring finnil fuinui About him cast her night-dark hair A renc gelebrin thiliol."" And arms like silver glimmering."" Who is she? This woman you sing of. 'Tis the lady of Luthien. The elf-maiden who gave her love to Beren, a mortal. What happened to her? She died. Get some sleep, Frodo. The power of Isengard is at your command... ... Sauron, Lord of the Earth. Build me an army worthy of Mordor. What orders from Mordor, my lord? What does the Eye command? We have work to do. The trees are strong, my lord. Their roots go deep. Rip them all down. This was the great watchtower of Amon Sûl. We shall rest here tonight. These are for you. Keep them close. I'm going to have a look around. Stay here. My tomato's burst. Could I have some bacon? Want a tomato, Sam? - What are you doing?! - Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon. - We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo. - Put it out, you fools! - Put it out! - That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes! Go! Back, you devils! Frodo! Oh, Sam. Strider! - Help him, Strider. - He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade. This is beyond my skill to heal. He needs elvish medicine. Hurry! We're six days from Rivendell! He'll never make it! Hold on, Frodo. Gandalf! Gwaihir - Go. Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls. Mr. Frodo? He's going cold. Is he going to die? He's passing into the shadow world. He'll soon become a wraith like them. - They're close. - Sam, do you know the Athelas plant? - Athelas? - Kingsfoil. Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed. It may help to slow the poisoning. Hurry! What's this, a ranger caught off his guard? Frodo. Im Arwen - Telin le thaed. l am Arwen - l've come to help you. Lasto beth nîn, tolo dan na ngalad. Hear my voice...come back to the light. Who is she? Frodo. - She's an elf. - He's fading. He's not going to last. We must get him to my father. - I've been looking for you for two days. - Where are you taking him? There are five wraiths behind you. Where the other four are, I do not know. Dartho guin Berian. Rych le ad tolthathon. Stay with the Hobbits, l'll send horses for you. Hon mabathon. Rochon ellint im. l'm the faster rider, l'll take him. Andelu i ven. The Road is too dangerous. What are they saying? Frodo fîr. Ae athradon i hîr...

Don't Look back. What are you doing?! Those wraiths are still out there! Noro lim, Asfaloth! Ride fast Asfaloth! Give up the halfling, She-elf. If you want him, come and claim him. Nîn o Chithaeglir... Waters of the Misty Mountains... ...lasto beth daer ...listen to the great word. Rimmo nÆn Bruinen dan in Ulaer! Flow waters of loudwater against the ringwraiths Nîn o Chithaeglir... Waters of the Misty Mountains... ...lasto beth daer ...listen to the great word. Rimmo nÆn Bruinen dan in Ulaer! Flow waters of loudwater against the ringwraiths No. No! Frodo, no. Frodo, don't give in. Not now. What grace is given me... ...let it pass to him. Let him be spared. Save him. Lasto beth nîn, tolo dan na ngalad. Hear my voice...come back to the light. - Where am I? - You are in the house of Elrond. And it is o'clock in the morning on October 24th, if you want to know. - Gandalf! - Yes, I'm here. And you're lucky to be here too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit. What happened, Gandalf? - Why didn't you meet us? - I am sorry, Frodo. I was delayed. A friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside. One ill turn deserves another. It is over. Embrace the power of the ring... ...or embrace your own destruction! There is only one lord of the ring. Only one who can bend it to his will. And he does not share power. So you have chosen...death. Gandalf? What is it? Nothing, Frodo. Frodo! - Sam. - Bless you, you're awake! Sam has hardly left your side. We were that worried about you. Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf? By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend. Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins. - Bilbo! - Hello, Frodo, my lad. Bilbo. There and back again A hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.'' - This is wonderful. - I meant to go back... ...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood... ...visit Lake-town... ...see the Lonely Mountain again. But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me. I miss the Shire. I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else. Off with you, on one of your adventures. But my own adventure turned out to be quite different. I'm not like you, Bilbo. My dear boy. - Now, what have I forgotten? - Packed already? No harm in being prepared. - I thought you wanted to see the elves. - I do. - More than anything. - I did. It's just.... We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we? We got the ring this far, to Rivendell. And I thought... ...seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon. Off home. You are right, Sam. We did what we set out to do. The ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am ready to go home. His strength returns. That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life. And yet to have come so far still bearing the ring... ...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil. It is a burden he should never have had to bear. - We can ask no more of Frodo. - Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's forces are massing in the East. His eye is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of allies grows thin. His treachery runs deeper than you know. By foul craft, Saruman has crossed orcs with goblin-men. He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the ring. This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the elves. We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard! Gandalf... ...the ring cannot stay here. This peril belongs to all Middle-earth. They must decide now how to end it. The time of the elves is over. My people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we've gone? The dwarves? They hide in mountains seeking riches. They care not for the troubles of others. It is in men that we must place our hope. Men? Men are weak. The race of men is failing. The blood of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten. It is because of men the ring survives. I was there, Gandalf. I was there years ago... ... when Isildur took the ring. I was there the day the strength of men failed. Isildur, hurry! Follow me. I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom... ...where the ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed. Cast it into the fire! - Destroy it! - No. Isildur! It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the ring. The line of kings is broken. There's no strength left in the world of men. - They're scattered, divided, leaderless. - There is one who could unite them. One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor. He turned from that path a long time ago. He has chosen exile. You are no elf. Men of the South are welcome here. - Who are you? - I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey. Then we are here on common purpose... ...friend. The shards of Narsil. The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand. It's still sharp. But no more than a broken heirloom. Why do you fear the past? You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himseIf. You are not bound to his fate. The same blood flows in my veins. The same weakness. Your time will come. You will face the same evil. And you will defeat it. A si i-Dhuath ú-orthor, Aragorn. The shadow does not hold sway yet, Aragorn Ú or le a ú or nin. Not over you, not over me. Renich i lú i erui govannem? Do you remember when we first met? Nauthannen i ned ôl reniannen. I thought I had strayed into a dream. Gwenwin in enninath. Long years have passed. Ú-'arnech in naeth i si celich. You did not wear the troubles you carry now. Renech i beth i pennen? Do you remember what I told you? You said you'd bind yourself to me... ...forsaking the immortal life of your people. And to that I hold. I would rather share one lifetime with you... ...than face all the ages of this world alone. I choose a mortal life. - You cannot give me this. - It is mine to give to whom I will... ...like my heart. Strangers from distant lands, friends of old... ...you've been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it. You will unite, or you will fall. Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom. Bring forth the ring, Frodo. So it is true. The ring of power... The doom of men... In a dream... ...I saw the eastern sky grow dark... ...but in the West a pale light lingered. A voice was crying: ""Your doom is near at hand. Isildur's bane is found."" Isildur s bane. Boromir! ""Ash nazg durbatulûk... ""One ring to rule them all... ...Ash nazg gimbatul... ...One ring to find them... ...Ash nazg thrakatulûk... ...One ring to bring them all... ...agh burzum-ishi krimpatul."" ...and in the darkness bind them."" Never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in Imladris. I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond... ...for the black speech of Mordor... ...may yet be heard... ...in every corner of the West! The ring is altogether evil. It is a gift. A gift to the foes of Mordor. Why not use this ring? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor... ...kept the forces of Mordor at bay. By the blood of our people... ...are your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy. Let us use it against him. You cannot wield it. None of us can. The one ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master. And what would a ranger know of this matter? This is no mere ranger. He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. You owe him your allegiance. Aragorn. This is Isildur s heir? And heir to the throne of Gondor. Havo dad, Legolas. Sit down, Legolas. Gondor has no king. Gondor needs no king. Aragorn is right. We cannot use it. You have only one choice. The ring must be destroyed. What are we waiting for? The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin... ...by any craft that we here possess. The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom. Only there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into Mordor... ...and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. Ash Nazg Durbatuluk... One ring to rule them all... One of you... ...must do this. One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep. The great eye is ever-watchful. It is a barren wasteland... ...riddled with fire, and ash and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with 10,000 men could you do this. It is folly. Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The ring must be destroyed. And I suppose you think you are the one to do it! And if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his? I will be dead before I see the ring in the hands of an elf! Never trust an elf! Do you not understand? While you bicker amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows! None can escape it! You'll all be destroyed! Ash Nazg Durbatuluk One ring to rule them all... ...Ash nazg gimbatul... ...One ring to find them... Ash Nazg Durbatuluk... One ring to rule them all... ...Ash nazg gimbatul... ...One ring to find them... Ash Nazg Durbatuluk... One ring to rule them all... ...Ash nazg gimbatul... ...One ring to find them... Ash Nazg Durbatuluk... One ring to rule them all... I will take it. I will take it. I will take the ring to Mordor. Though... ...I do not know the way. I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins... ...as long as it is yours to bear. If by my life or death I can protect you... ...I will. You have my sword. And you have my bow. And my ax. You carry the fates of us all, little one. If this is indeed the will of the Council... ...then Gondor will see it done. - Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me. - No indeed it is hardly possible to separate you... ...even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not. Oy. We're coming too! You'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us. Anyway, you need people of intelligence on this sort of... ...mission. Quest. Thing. Well, that rules you out, Pip. Nine companions. So be it. You shall be: The Fellowship of the Ring. Great! Where are we going? Anirne hene beriad i chen lîn. She wanted to protect her child. Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen. She thought in Rivendell you would be safe. In her heart, your mother knew you'd be hunted all your life. That you'd never escape your fate. The skill of the elves can reforge the sword of kings... ...but only you have the power to wield it. I do not want that power. I have never wanted it. You are the last of that bloodline. There is no other. My old sword! Sting. Here, take it. Take it. - It's so light. - Yes, yeah. Made by the elves, you know. The blade glows blue when orcs are close. And it's times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful. Here's a pretty thing. Mithril. As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales. Let me see you put it on. Come on. My old ring. I should very much like... ...to hold it again, one last time. I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy. I'm sorry that you must carry this burden. I'm sorry for everything. The ring-bearer is setting out on the quest of Mount Doom. On you who travel with him, no oath... ...nor bond is laid to go further than you will. Farewell. Hold to your purpose. May the blessings of elves and men... ...and all free folk go with you. The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer. Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right? Left. We must hold to this course, west of the Misty Mountains, for days. If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us. From there, our road turns east to Mordor. Two, one, five. Good! Very good. Move your feet. - You look good, Pippin. - Thanks. Faster! If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note they're not... ...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round. Gandalf. We could pass through the mines of Moria. My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome. No Gimli, I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice. Sorry! Get him! - For the Shire! - Hold him. Hold him down, Merry! Gentlemen, that's enough. You've got my arm! You've got my arm! - What is that? - Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud. It's moving fast. Against the wind. - Crebain from Dunland! - Hide! - Hurry! - Take cover! Spies of Saruman. The passage south is being watched. We must take the pass of Caradhras. Frodo! Boromir. It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt... ...over so small a thing. Such a little thing. Boromir! Give the ring to Frodo. As you wish. I care not. So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras. And if that fails, where then will you go? If the mountain defeats you... ... will you risk a more dangerous road? Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse! Wake up cruel Redhorn! There is a fell voice on the air. Nai yarvaxea rasselya! May your horn be bloodstained! It's Saruman! He's trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf, we must turn back! No! Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho i 'ruith! Sleep Caradhras, be still, lie still, hold your wrath! Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse! Wake up cruel Redhorn! Nai yarvaxea rasselya... May your bloodstained horn... ...taltuva notto-carinnar! ...fall upon enemy heads! We must get off the mountain! Make for the Gap of Rohan, and take the west road to my city! The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard! We cannot pass over a mountain. Let us go under it. Let us go through the mines of Moria. Moria. You fear to go into those mines. The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep. You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-dûm: Shadow and flame. Let the ring-bearer decide. We cannot stay here! This will be the death of the hobbits. Frodo? We will go through the mines. So be it. Frodo, come and help an old man. How is your shoulder? - Better than it was. - And the ring? You feel its power growing, don't you? I've felt it too. You must be careful now. Evil will be drawn to you from outside the fellowship. And, I fear, from within. - Who then do I trust? - You must trust yourself. Trust your own strengths. - What do you mean? - There are many powers in this world... ...for good or for evil. Some are greater than I am. And against some I have not yet been tested. The walls... ...of Moria. Dwarf doors are invisible when closed. Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten. Why doesn't that surprise me? Well, let's see. Ithildin. It mirrors only starlight and moonlight. It reads; ""The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. - Speak, friend, and enter."" - What do you suppose that means? Oh It's quite simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open. Annon Edhellen, edro hi ammen! Gate of the elves, open now for me! ...lasto beth lammen. ...listen to the word of my tongue. Nothing's happening. I once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves... ...men and orcs. What are you going to do, then? Knock your head against these doors, Peregrin Took! And if that does not shatter them... ...and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions... ...I will try to find the opening words. Ando Eldarinwa... Gate of elves... ...a lasta quettanya... ...listen to my word... ...Fenda Casarinwa... ...threshold of dwarves... Mines are no place for a pony. - Even one so brave as Bill. - Bye-bye, Bill. Fennas Nogothrim... Doorway of the dwarf-folk... Go on, Bill. Go on. Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home. Do not disturb the water. Oh, it's useless. It's a riddle. ""Speak 'friend' and enter."" What's the elvish word for ""friend""? Mellon. Soon, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves. Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone! This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin. And they call it a mine. A mine! This is no mine. It's a tomb. No.... No! Goblins. We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should never have come here. Now, get out of here. Get out! - Frodo! - Help! Strider! - Help! - Get off him! Aragorn! Frodo! Into the mines! - Legolas! - Into the cave! Run! We now have but one choice. We must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard. There are older and fouler things than orcs... ...in the deep places of the world. Quietly now. It's a four-day journey to the other side. Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed. The wealth of Moria was not in gold... ...or jewels... ...but mithril. Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him. - Oh, that was a kingly gift. - Yes. I never told him... ...but its worth was greater than the value of the Shire. Pippin. I have no memory of this place. - Are we Lost? - No. - I think we are. - Gandalf's thinking. - Merry? - What? I'm hungry. - There's something down there. - It's Gollum. - Gollum? - He's been following us for three days. - He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr? - Escaped... ...or was set loose. Now the ring has brought him here. He will never be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the ring, as he hates and loves himseIf. Smeagol's life is a sad story. Yes, Smeagol he was once called. Before the ring found him. Before it drove him mad. It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance. Pity? It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill... ...before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many. I wish the ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened. So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In which case, you also were meant to have it. And that is an encouraging thought. It's that way. - He's remembered. - No. But the air doesn't smell so foul down here. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose. Let me risk a little more light. Behold... ...the great realm and dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf. Now there's an eye opener, and no mistake. Gimli! No! Oh, no. No. ""Here lies Balin... ...son of Fundin... ...Lord of Moria."" He is dead, then. It's as I feared. We must move on. We cannot linger. ""They have taken the bridge and the second hall. We have barred the gates... ...but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes. Drums... ...drums in the deep. We cannot get out. A shadow moves in the dark. We cannot get out. They are coming."" Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity. Frodo! Orcs. Get back! Stay close to Gandalf! They have a cave-troll. Let them come! There is one dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath. I think I'm getting the hang of this. Frodo! Aragorn! Aragorn! Frodo! Frodo! Oh, no. He's alive. I'm all right. I'm not hurt. You should be dead. That spear would have skewered a wild boar. I think there's more to this hobbit than meets the eye. Mithril. You are full of surprises, Master Baggins. To the bridge of Khazad-dûm! This way! What is this new devilry? A Balrog. A demon of the ancient world. This foe is beyond any of you. Run! Quickly! Gandalf. Lead them on, Aragorn. The bridge is near. Do as I say! Swords are no more use here. Gandalf! Merry! Pippin! Sam! Nobody tosses a Dwarf. Not the beard! Steady. Hold on! Hang on! Lean forward! Steady. Come on! Now! Over the bridge! Fly! You cannot pass! Gandalf! I am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn! Go back to the Shadow. YOU - SHALL NOT - PASS! - No! No! - Gandalf! Fly, you fools! No! Aragorn! Legolas, get them up. Give them a moment, for pity's sake! By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs. We must reach the woods of Lothlórien. Come, Boromir. Legolas. Gimli, get them up. On your feet, Sam. Frodo? Frodo! Stay close, young hobbits! They say that a great sorceress lives in these woods. An elf-witch... ...of terrible power. All who look upon her... ...fall under her spell. Frodo! And are never seen again. Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom. You bring great evil here, ring-bearer. Mr. Frodo? Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox. The dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark. Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion. Welcome, Legolas son of Thranduil. Govannas vîn gwennen le, Our fellowship stands in your debt, Haldir o Lórien. Haldir of Lórien. A, Aragorn in Dúnedain... Oh, Aragorn of the Dúnedain... ...istannen le ammen. ...you are known to us. Haldir. So much for the legendary courtesy of the elves! Speak words we can all understand! We have not had dealings with the dwarves since the dark days. And you know what this dwarf says to that? Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul! I spit upon your grave! That was not so courteous. You bring great evil with you. You can go no further. Boe ammen veriad lîn. Andelu i ven! We need your protection. The road is fell! Merin le telim. I wish we may come with you. Henio, aníron boe ammen i dulu lîn! Please, understand, we need your support! Aragorn! Merin le telim. I wish we may come with you. Andelu i ven. The road is very dangerous. Gandalf's death was not in vain. Nor would he have you give up hope. You carry a heavy burden, Frodo. Don't carry the weight of the dead. You will follow me. Cares Galeton. The heart of Elvendom on earth. Realm of the Lord Celeborn and of Galadriel, Lady of Light. The enemy knows you have entered here. What hope you had in secrecy is now gone. Eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is Gandalf? For I much desire to speak with him. I can no longer see him from afar. Gandalf the Grey did not pass the borders of this land. He has fallen into shadow. He was taken by both shadow and flame. A Balrog of Morgoth. For we went needlessly into the net of Moria. Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life. We do not yet know his full purpose. Do not let the great emptiness of Khazad-dûm fill your heart... ...Gimli, son of Gloin. For the world has grown full of peril... ...and in all lands... ...love is now mingled with grief. What now becomes of this fellowship? Without Gandalf, hope is lost. The quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail... ...to the ruin of all. Yet hope remains while the company is true. Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest... ...for you are weary with sorrow and much toil. Tonight, you will sleep.... Welcome, Frodo of the Shire... ...one who has seen the eye! A lament for Gandalf. What do they say about him? I have not the heart to tell you. For me, the grief is still too near. I bet they don't mention his fireworks. There should be a verse about them. The finest rockets ever seen They burst in stars of blue and green Or after thunder, silver showers Came falling like a rain of flowers Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road. Take some rest. These borders are well-protected. I will find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head. She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor. She said to me; ""Even now there is hope Left."" But I cannot see it. It is long since we had any hope. My father is a noble man. But his rule is failing... ...and our people lose faith. He looks to me to make things right, and I would do it. I would see the glory of Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it, Aragorn? The white tower of Ecthelion. Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver. Its banners caught high in the morning breeze. Have you ever been called home... ...by the clear ringing of silver trumpets? I have seen the white city... ...long ago. One day, our paths will lead us there. And the tower guard shall take up the call: ""The Lords of Gondor have returned."" Will you look into the mirror? What will I see? Even the wisest cannot tell. For the mirror... ...shows many things. Things that were... ...things that are... ...and some things... ...that have not yet come to pass. I know what it is you saw. For it is also in my mind. It is what will come to pass if you should fail. The fellowship is breaking. It is already begun. He will try to take the ring. You know of whom I speak. One by one, it will destroy them all. If you ask it of me... ... I will give you the one ring. You offer it to me freely. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this. In place of a dark lord, you would have a queen... ...not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Treacherous as the sea! Stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me... ...and despair. I pass the test. I will diminish... ...and go into the West... ...and remain Galadriel. - I cannot do this alone. You are a ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a ring of power... ...is to be alone. This is Nenya, the ring of Adamant. And I am its keeper. This task was appointed to you. And if you do not find a way... ...no one will. Then I know what I must do. It's just... ...I'm afraid to do it. Even the smallest person can change the course of the future. Do you know how the orcs first came into being? They were elves once. Taken by the dark powers... ...tortured and mutilated. A ruined and terrible form of life. And now... ...perfected. My fighting Uruk-hai... ...whom do you serve? Saruman! Hunt them down. Do not stop until, they are found. You do not know pain. You do not know fear. You will taste man-flesh! One of the halflings carries something of great value. Bring them to me alive and unspoiled. Kill the others. Never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people. May these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes. Lembas. Elvish waybread. One small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man. How many did you eat? Four. Every league you travel south, the danger will increase. Mordor orcs now hold the eastern shore of the Anduin. Nor will you find safety on the western bank. Strange creatures bearing the mark of the white hand have been seen on our borders. Seldom do orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these have done so. Le aphadar aen. You are being tracked. By river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the falls of Rauros. My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim. Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin. These are the daggers of the Noldorin. They have already seen service in war. Do not fear, young Peregrin Took. You will find your courage. And for you, Samwise Gamgee... ...Elven rope made of hithlain. Thank you, my lady. Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers? And what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves? Nothing. Except to look upon the lady of the Galadhrim one last time... ...for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth. Actually.... There was one thing. No, no, I couIdn't. It's quite impossible. Stupid to ask. I have nothing greater to give... ...than the gift you already bear. Am meleth dîn... For her love... ...I ant e guil Arwen Undómiel pígatha. ...I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar will diminish. Aníron i e broniatha, ad ae periatham... I would have her leave these shores... ...athar i methid en-amar hen. ...and be with her people. Aníron i e círatha na Valannor. I would have her take the ship to Valinor. That choice is yet before her. You have your own choice to make, Aragorn. To rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of Elendil... ...or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin. Namárië. Farewell. Nadath nâ i moe cerich. There is much you have yet to do. Dan, ú-'eveditham, Elessar. We shall not meet again, Elessar. Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the light of Earendil... ...our most beloved star. May it be a light for you in dark places... ... when all other lights go out. I have taken my worst wound at this parting... ...having looked my last upon that which is fairest. Henceforth I will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me. What was her gift? I asked her for one hair from her golden head. She gave me three. Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria. I had hoped we would lose him on the river. But he's too clever a waterman. And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts... ...it will make the crossing even more dangerous. Have some food, Mr. Frodo. - No, Sam. - You haven't eaten anything all day. You're not sleeping, neither. Don't think I haven't noticed. - Mr. Frodo - I'm all right. But you're not. I'm here to help you. I promised Gandalf that I would. You can't help me, Sam. Not this time. Get some sleep. Minas Tirith is the safer road. You know that. From there we can regroup. Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength. There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us. You were quick enough to trust the elves. Have you so little faith in your own people? Yes, there is weakness. There is frailty. But there is courage also, and honor to be found in men. But you will not see that. You are afraid! All your life, you have hidden in the shadows. Scared of who you are, of what you are. I will not lead the ring within a hundred leagues of your city. Frodo. The Argonath. Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old. My kin. We cross the lake at nightfall. Hide the boats and continue on foot. - We approach Mordor from the North. - Oh, yes? Just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil... ...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks. And after that, it gets even better. Festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see. That is our road. I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf. Recover my... - We should Leave now. - No. Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness. It is not the eastern shore that worries me. A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind. Something draws near. I can feel it. Recover strength? Pay no heed to that, young hobbit. Where's Frodo? None of us should wander alone. You, least of all. So much depends on you. Frodo? I know why you seek solitude. You suffer. I see it day by day. You sure you do not suffer needlessly? There are other ways, Frodo. - Other paths that we might take. - I know what you would say. It would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart. Warning...against what? We're all afraid, Frodo. But to let that fear drive us, to destroy what hope we have... ...don't you see that is madness? - There is no other way. I ask only for the strength to defend my people! - If you would but lend me the ring. - No. - Why do you recoil? I am no thief. - You are not yourself. What chance do you think you have? They will find you. They will take the ring. And you will beg for death before the end! You fool! It is not yours, save by unhappy chance! It could have been mine. It should be mine! Give it to me! - Give it to me! - No! - Give it to me! - No. I see your mind. You will take the ring to Sauron! You will betray us! You'll go to your death, and the death of us all! Curse you! Curse you and all the halflings! Frodo? Frodo. What have I done? Please, Frodo. Frodo, I'm sorry! Ash Ghurûm They will fall Frodo? - It has taken Boromir. - Where is the ring? Stay away! Frodo! - I swore to protect you. - Can you protect me from yourself? Would you destroy it? Aragorn. Aragorn. Elessar. I would have gone with you to the end. Into the very fires of Mordor. I know. Look after the others. Especially Sam. He will not understand. Go, Frodo! Run. Run! Mr. Frodo! Find the halfling! Find the halfling! Elendil! Aragorn, go! Frodo! Hide here. Quick! Come on! What's he doing? He's leaving. - No! - Pippin! Run, Frodo. Go! - Hey! Hey, you! - Over here! - Over here! - This way! - It's working! - I know it's working! Run! - The horn of Gondor. - Boromir. Run! No. - They took the little ones. - Hold still. Frodo. Where is Frodo? I let Frodo go. Then you did what I could not. I tried to take the ring from him. - The ring is beyond our reach now. - Forgive me. I did not see it. - I have failed you all. - No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You have kept your honor. Leave it. It is over. The world of men will fall and all will come to darkness... ...and my city to ruin. I do not know what strength is in my blood... ...but I swear to you, I will not let the white city fall... ...nor our people fail. Our people. Our people. I would have followed you, my brother. My captain. My king. Be at peace... ...son of Gondor. They will look for his coming from the white tower. But he will not return. Frodo! I wish the ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened. So do all who live to see such times... ...but that is not for them to decide. All you have to decide... ...is what to do with the time that is given to you. Frodo, no! Frodo! - Mr. Frodo! - No, Sam. Go back, Sam! - I'm going to Mordor alone. - Of course you are. And I'm coming with you! You can't swim! Sam! Sam! I made a promise, Mr. Frodo. A promise: ""Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."" And I don't mean to. I don't mean to. Oh Sam. Come on. Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore. - You mean not to follow them. - Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands. Then it has all been in vain. The fellowship has failed. Not if we hold true to each other. We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death. Not while we have strength left. Leave all that can be spared behind. We travel light. Let us hunt some orc. Yes! Mordor. I hope the others find a safer road. Strider will look after them. I don't suppose we'll ever see them again. We may yet, Mr. Frodo. We may. Sam... ...I'm glad you are with me."
14,2004,Friday Night Lights,American,"As preseason practice begins for the Permian High School football team in August 1988, the town of Odessa, Texas has high expectations for the players and their coach Gary Gaines to win a state championship with their star running back James ""Boobie"" Miles. The quarterback, Mike Winchell, runs under the expectation of handing off the ball to Miles on most plays. Fullback Don Billingsley struggles with his ball handling and is abused by his alcoholic father Charles, who won a state championship with Permian. The players frequently party as they deal with the pressures of Odessa's expectations.
In the season opener against the Marshall Bulldogs, the Permian Panthers make the game a blowout. Gaines intends to bench Miles in the waning minutes, but keeps him in after third-stringer Chris Comer is unprepared to go in. Miles tears his ACL after being tackled at the knee, and afterwards Gaines is widely criticized by the town for keeping Miles in. In the next game during the start of district play, Permian gets blown out as Winchell struggles with consistency in his increased role and the second-string running back gets hurt. Comer goes in, but avoids contact, and discussion arises about Gaines losing his job. However, the Panthers start winning again as Winchell and Comer improve, and safety Brian Chavez and linebacker Ivory Christian emerge as defensive standouts.
Miles holds out hope that he can return to playing soon, and although his MRI scan shows otherwise, he rejects it and lies to Gaines so he can suit up again, with his uncle and guardian L.V. backing him up. Permian plays its final district game against Midland Lee, with first place and a playoff spot on the line. The Panthers fall behind, and Gaines puts Miles in out of desperation, but Miles is soon injured again. Winchell leads a comeback drive, but Permian loses as his final pass flies over the receiver's hands. After the game, Billingsley fights with his drunk father, who throws his state championship ring onto the side of the freeway. The next morning, Don reveals to his father that he recovered the championship ring and gives it back to him. Charles partially apologizes and makes the point that his state championship was the best thing that happened to him, and he now has nothing happy except those memories. The loss puts Permian in a three-way tie for first place with Lee and Abilene Cooper, and a coin toss is held to determine which two teams make the playoffs. Permian and Lee win the toss, and as the Panthers prepare for the playoffs, Miles clears his locker. While in his uncle's car, he cries about his future in football becoming bleak.
Permian is successful in the playoffs, but all eyes are on the state powerhouse Dallas Carter High School. Permian and Carter make it to the state championship game, which is held at the Astrodome due to the schools' different demographics. Miles rejoins the team and watches from the sidelines as the Panthers head into the game. They are initially overwhelmed by Carter's superior size and fall behind, but mount a comeback in the second half to pull within one score. The defense improves its tackling, and the offense pushes through despite injuries. After a defensive stop, Winchell, Comer, and Billingsley mount a final drive, but Comer and Billingsley are injured. Billingsley goes back in, and holds onto the ball for a big run, but it is called back for a holding penalty. On fourth down, Winchell is stopped just short of the goal line as the clock runs out, and Carter wins the championship.
Afterwards, Gaines removes the outgoing seniors from his depth chart, and it is revealed that Winchell, Billingsley, Miles, and Chavez went on to have successful lives after their football careers ended, with only Christian receiving a Division I scholarship. The movie ends with the statement that Gaines and Comer led Permian to an undefeated state championship season the following year.",8.7,tt0758745,"This new coach, he's got himself a lot of pressure right now. Got yourself a heck of a QB. Is true that you can throw a 400-yard touchdown pass to three different receivers? That's a gigantic hit on Street. Jason's paralyzed. He'll regain use of his arms, his hands, but they don't think he's gonna regain use of his legs. Jason can never know what happened between us. You think little Matt Saracen can get it done? - What's your name? - Matt Saracen. - What do you play? - QB 1. Boys think about sex every single minute of the day. Your mother wanted me to add that football players are the worst offender. However, I think that it pretty much crosses all lines. - I love you. - I love you, too. If you're not doing anything on Friday... - Yes. - It's a date, then. You look good, like real good. Probably because yesterday I was baptized and accepted Jesus - as my lord and savior. - Still the best I've ever had. - I think I got myself a job. - Really? That fast you got a job? Yeah, I'm the new guide counselor at the high school. Smash Williams... He breaks a tackle! - He's dragging guys along. - Touchdown! Panthers win State! Just be honest with me. It's my parents. It's me feeling trapped. Nothing seems right anymore. I just really need some space. - Leave my sister alone. - You've one of ours, why shouldn't we get one of yours? They're revoking my scholarship. That's the mark of death, coach. That's my future. This team has never been about one player, it's about all of us, every single one of us. Not one man, every single one of us, together. - Clear eyes, full hearts... - Can't lose! Let's get 'em! This is Slammin' Sammy Mead, folks, and Panther football is just five days away. You know what that means: time to start talking. Coach Eric Taylor, misunderstood genius, a one hit wonder. John, from Seven Lakes, you're on, come on, what d'you got? I'll tell you, Sammy, I was all for bringing Taylor back from TMU even though he abandoned us. But we all saw what happened which was Smash Williams got injured. And the guy had no back-up plan. - Zero. - I hear you, John. Anyone who coach a Pop Warner of the NFL and I've coached my share of Pop Warner, you've got to have a back-up plan. The sprinkler is on. It's not about the Celica. I know it's a practicable car, it's about the fact that I can't have you changing your classes. You need to be in Dr. Wells English class. Mom, stop it, only for 12,000 miles in the car. I know all the tricks, so technically they're all christian miles. I don't care what kind of miles they are. - You act as I'm dropping out of school. - She's not listening to me. I just want to get a job. I'm taking same amount of classes in fewer hours. - I'm making my time more efficient. - It's not efficient for you to take a class with a teacher who is in failure. It'd be nice if people didn't throw the trash in my car. This is my car. And second of all, Principal Taylor, you look hot. - Thank you, thank you. - Yes, ma'am. Coach Taylor. The problem remains your team imploded in last year's playoffs when Smash Williams hurt his knee. We couldn't win without him then, how could we win now that he's graduated? Team's got a lot of spirit, team's doing just fine. Very solid, very solid. We have Tim Riggins stepping in the Smash Williams crucial role of tailback. What if he takes off to Mexico like last year? Is Tim Riggins... Is he focused? One thing I can guarantee about Tim Riggins is that he is focused on football and only football. How are Riggins and Saracen jelling? Just keep running for the ball. I'm putting the ball where you gotta be. Tim and Matt are like brothers. About that new quarterback from Dallas... - You know, J.D. McCoy. - McCoy. There are rumors that he may replace Saracen... Nice snag, come up. J.D. McCoy is a freshman. But he broke state records when he was in middle school. - Since you're into rebuilding year... - We're not in a rebuilding year. - We're not in a rebuilding year. - You're saying Matt Saracen's your man? That's very much what I'm saying. Matt Saracen, whether he's on the field or off the field... Whatever you throw at that young man, he can handle. I can't get this knot out of my shoe, okay? Matt, forget about... You're not gonna do it. - You've been working on it all summer. - Take your time, seriously. Well, my point is that this is your senior year... and after this, it's all... It's all just downhill. I mean, right, Tyra? Doesn't he need to suck up every second of this? Look, this year is all about doing well so I can get out of Dillon forever. - It's all I care about. - Baby, that's not the point... The phlegm... Don't call me that. What's going on with y'all two? - We broke up. - Taking a break. We broke up. Three steps back, watch your shoulders. Ear high. Left. Is that... Is that J.D? Looks like the clock is ticking, man. Let's just go to pep rally. Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to introduce to you... New Dillon High Principal, Mrs. Tami Taylor. How are you doing? Y'all having fun? Don't even worry about that two game rumor deal. What two-game rumor? I got it under control. So, without any further due, I'd like to introduce the coach of the Dillon Panthers, my date to the Homecoming dance, Eric Taylor. I wanna ask one question. I wanna ask all of you... only one question. Are you ready for Friday night? Here are your Dillon Panthers. 3x01: I KNEW YOU WHEN Subtitles: Team Panthers With the participation of: benj!, charliea, DarKsh, GillesSilb, Ju, loky34, ouazo, tactactac, Teardrop Lyla, rise and shine, baby. I've made your favorite pegs and eggs. And chocolate chip pancakes. - Dad, I'm not anymore. - I know. But I'm just... so happy you're here. It's first day at school and you're a senior. You can go to any college you want to, and I'm proud of you. You're here with me and not with mum. Northern California or some vegetarian, raising figs... I'm just... It's a great day, let's go. I'll be up in 5. - Is there enough pegs and eggs for me? - Shut up. Maybe you need to get a workout before breakfast. You know what? No, what are you gonna do? Come on. Let's go! Well, you cut off two 10s for sec. - Two 10s? Let's call Sammy Mead. - Two 10s. Tell him I'll be able to run the Buddy Garrity's day charity race this year. You go see that doctor tomorrow, I wanna start doing some side-to-side on that knee. Find out what he has to say. What do you spend all this time on me? I mean, I graduated, I'm not your problem anymore. The reason I'm spending all this time on you... It's 'cause I wanna get you on team and college so I don't have to see your ugly face up at Alamo Freeze anymore. Call me after you see that doctor. Yes, sir. Don't forget to pick up those cones! Emily, Barbara, good morning. Good to see y'all. Yeah, here we go. Hey, Sarah, great to see you this year. - Hey, Principal T. - Cute haircut. - Congratulations. - It's gonna be a great year. - Good luck. - For you. - You're gonna have a good day. - Thank you. Hi, vice-principal Trucks, how are you this morning? Good morning. AC system is down. We've students on Cortese Avenue abandoned 'cause there was no room on the school bus. Good lord, we need to get those students taken care of. I've borrowed the team buses, I put a request into the district for additional buses. Hopefully, that will get us one. So there are gonna be taken care of these kids? Great, what about the AC? We've put a band-aid on it and pray like always. All right. Thank you. Don't forget the budget's due by the end of the week. I'm collecting all the data for that, have a great day. That feels good. Hey, how are you? I guess I lost the lottery. I'm your rally girl this year. Damn... Lyla, rally girl. So are you two together? - No, we're buddies. - No, we're just friends. - Good buddies, strong friends, yeah. - Good friends buddies. Anyway, Tim, here's my number. Anything you need, anytime you want it. That's good, I think we've spent enough time in school today. Let's go to the roof and see what happens. - What about homeroom? - What about homeroom? - What's going on, Rigs? - Gentlemen. Party Wednesday at Gangi's, his parents are out of town. The cheerleaders said something about baby oil and a bounce house. - I don't know. - Really? - Twins are gonna be there. - That's gonna get greasy. Set your feet, J.D, set your feet. Bring him up, bring him up. McCoy is looking good. Let's see what happens when the more of us drop. White, 9! Hut! What the hell are you doing? Come on! Come on, you got to make it straight, let's go! I'd rather see my boy getting some reps out there. Yeah, that'll happen. Let's go! Get your head in the game, let's go. Get on the ball, Riggins! Who the hell is that up there talking to him? That's J.D. McCoy's daddy. Big beer distributor, called the stud of suds. Look at old Buddy sucking up up there. Hey, Buddy! Let's go, gentlemen! What schools were you thinking of applying to? I was thinking of... U.T. Austin, TMU, Southern Methodist, maybe INM. I see. Tyra... you really think that sounds realistic? Well, okay, I know INM is a long shot, but... You have a 2.6 GPA. There is no way any of those schools you just mentioned are going - to seriously consider... - You have to look at my progress. My grades from last year have radically improved. I know, but your 1.9 in freshman year still counts. It all counts. - I don't want you to waste your time... - Mrs. Taylor, she told me... Ms Colette, state's schools are a pipe dream. Can you think about other options? Technical Colleges, Junior Colleges... Like Dillon Tech? Don't look out on Dillon Tech, it's a good option. It's a realistic option. - Bored in the midnight hole, are you? - Buddy... T. Tammy, what are you doing, making some big power moves? Yeah, it's awfully glamorous. Right now, I'm trying to decide if we can afford chalk or soap this year. - Wish I was kidding. - T. Tammy, I'm here to cheer you up. You always do. I got those two words for you. - Come on. - Jumbo Tron. Jumbo Tron? Have you ever seen two people engaged on a Jumbo Tron, at a football game? Just think about it. Love and football are the two greatest things in the world. You put the two together, put it on a ft Mitsubishi screen, and it's pure nirvana. - That's a big check. - Yes, ma'am. Oh, my... We have lost four teachers to budget cuts this year. We need a Jumbo Tron, you think? Well, no Tammy, we don't need one. But we want one. And we are gonna have one because of that, and you are gonna get all the credit. - That's a lot of zeros right there... - Yes, it is. You and I are gonna make a beautiful team together, T. Tammy. - Clear eyes, full hearts... - Okay, let's not go there. For six weeks, it's great. Great sex, great everything, you know? Then, we go to school, it's like... it's like a 180. Sounds to me Tim, like you got a problem. It's what it sounds like. I told you from day one that Lyla was never gonna take you seriously. One of these days, you're gonna stop with all the screwing around, and find you the love of a good woman. Like I got with Mandy. Yeah, Billy, you got a real fairy tale going on right now. That's a job, Tim. You think I give a crap that my girlfriend is giving some fifty year old fat-ass trucker a lap-dance? Hey, Mand, I love you baby! - I'm lucky I have you. - See? You see that, Tim? That's public. Look at me. That's love. That whole Lyla thing... She went to bed with Jesus, and woke up with you. Jesus... you. - You are a rebound from Jesus. - No, I'm not a rebound. You're a summer fling, Tim. I don't believe that. The A.C.L. is healing nicely. The muscles surrounding your knee are getting stronger, which is great. Looks like you are on your way to a full recovery. Got yourself a clean bill of health, son. That's wonderful, ain't that? He still gonna get that scholarship, I know it. - I'm just trying to think positive... - I lost the scholarship. - They gave it away. - They said for you to contact them... The semester started kick-off this week, I missed the year. And Dr. Wabono, if everything is back to normal, why am I still having a second slow on a forty than I was before the injury? Well, Smash, your progress have been great, but there's no guarantee, that you'll regain the speed you had pre-injury. So you're saying this is as fast as I'm gonna get? Possibly. Look, you need to be thankful for the progress that you've made so far... and keep working at it and that's all you can do. - Well... - Hold on one second. I'm almost done. A second is long enough. There's a lot of calculations... Landry, honey, did you get to fix that toilet, I really gotta go. Yeah, I fixed it, but you all gonna have to start flushing genuinely and tell Mandy to stop putting so much toilet paper in it. You are so smart, thank you, you angel. - Isn't he fantastic? - You're embarrassing me. Thank you, sweetheart. You have fun. See something? - If I carry the one... - What? Okay, so... In order for you to get a 3.5 GPA overall, you'll need to get... like a 6.4 GPA this year. Which is gonna be tough. I just wanted to say I'm so honored to be here with you all this year, and... And I'm here to make your jobs easier. I'm here to make us all the best educators we can be, so please, I want open dialog, I want you all to speak up, and I wanna open the floor right now, for questions, or comments or concerns or anything... Anybody. I'd love to hear you. Any chance the four teachers that got laid off are gonna... return? Be replaced? You know we're working through the budget right now. It's tricky. It's gonna be a tricky one and it's gonna weigh on everyone... But we're not even gonna get a Spanish teacher - that actually speaks Spanish... - How about supplies? I've been teaching out of the same history book for fifteen years. You know, I do have textbooks... Do you know a lot of us buy our own supplies? - I'm gonna start making a list. - How about just getting us some paper? - Let's go! - Let's go, let's go guys. - What's your read, Matt? - Black eight! Black eight, hut! Throw the ball, throw the ball! Get rid of it! Saracen, Riggins, get over here! - Come here. - Let's go, Riggins! Is there something going on I need to know about? Let me tell you two something, you better get together right now. Cause if you don't, I will replace you, I promise you that. You got me? - Yes, sir. - Make it work. Let's go out there and run it the right way. Come on, let's move. Looking around, let's go! What the hell is that? J.D. McCoyle's daddy bought us all smoothies. Not for now, for after the practice. Smoothies? Yeah, those frosty tiny things with a non-fat yoghurt... I know what the hell a smoothie is. Tell him to get the hell off the field. You mean for good, or to come back later? Or what? Tell him we don't need any damn smoothies. Alright, alright! Get that pink ass suck-up off the field, just get him out of here! Just move it up the premises, let's go. - Damn! I want a smoothie. Damn, man. - What was that, Charles? What did you say? You want a smoothie? - Do you want a smoothie? - It's like degrees in here. It's hot out here, isn't it? - Yeah. - I'd like a smoothie too, Charles. It'd be good, wouldn't it? But you know why I'm not gonna have one, Charles? Cause I don't feel like I deserve a smoothie! Does anybody else out here, feel like he deserves a smoothie? I'll tell you what, we win Friday night and you can have all the damn smoothies you want, gentlemen. But until then, get your minds back in the game and let's finish up this practice. Let's go! Let's go, boys. Everything's okay? - Fine. Ditching class. - Where are you going? Wait a minute, hon. No, you're not ditching class. What are you doing? You're not ditching class. - After all we've talked about... - Why? So I can get into Dillon Tech? What do you mean? 'Cause that's the only college I'm gonna be able to get into, ain't that right? Wait a minute, hon, hold on... You filled my head with all of these possibilities. - Okay... What are you talking about? - TMU, University of Texas... But none is possible with my grades, is it? - It's not just about grades. - Oh, it's not just that? The average student getting into UT has a 3.8, TMU is 3.7. So, what? I've never said it was gonna be easy. You never said impossible. I've worked my ass off these last two years. I know. You know, Mr. Trucks, he had a good point. I gotta be more realistic. - Wait a minute, honey... - Put my time to better use. No, ma'am... No, ma'am! You come back here right now. Tyra! You come back here right now. Girl, listen! After all we've been through... Don't do this! Tyra, don't do it. Julie, let's go! Here. - Eggs, what's the occasion? - The occasion's your mother wants you to start eating breakfast 'cause that's the most important meal. Dad, I only eat free-range eggs. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, eat your eggs. So you got dumped with me and Gracie again? No, your mother had to deal with an urgent air-conditioning situation. If I had my car, I could drop Gracie off in the morning and pick her up at night. You don't have one. Sit down... Well, I can fix my schedule right, okay? So, mum wanted me to take an AP English class and Mr. Munios is teaching AP English class in 3rd period, so I can take 7th and 8th period free, and then take social studies during 5th period as an independent study. And today is the last day I can make schedule changes, so I was hoping you could sign. Sign? I'm not gonna sign off anything without your mum's permission. Dad, please. I tried to get her all week, she's been so busy. Hang on, babe. I know. Sorry. I can't do that. You want me to get a job, right? You want me to become more responsible, join the work force, have goals for myself, become an adult, become independent, right? Please? Sit down, eat your eggs and I'll look at it. She's throwing riddles at me, Williams. What do I do? This is an exchange for shutting up about Lyla. Alright? I heard you are playing my old position, how's life for a tailback? You want the truth? I go back to fullback and RB, I got coach, I got 7, rotting my ass every single day like I asked for the gig... And you're gonna like this one, I'm reminded every single day that out there, I'm no Smash Williams. We're in the same boat, Rigg. I've just been told I'm not Smash Williams either. - What do you mean? - The knee... I'm slow. Doctor said I'm as good as done, but Coach thinks I should keep trying. Okay, wait. Doctor says you can't do it, right? Right? What's the issue? That's a very good question. - Your love line is so deep. - Oh, yeah, it is. - You know what that means? - No. Means you're really good in bed. I've heard lots of stories about you. But I mean I've never gotten into experiences except for myself. Get off him, Joanie. Joanie Pinchel, Tim? Really? Oh, man... Why is it the minute you walk in school you turn into some dumb jerk? What is the problem with being a Panther, now? Everything! And everyone looks at you like the pinnacle of the dumbest part of it. And you just totally play into it. - No idea what you're talking about. - Really? You know what the problem is? You don't take me seriously. - I'm some fling to you. - You're not a fling. Okay, then what's the problem? - Shoot. - You wanna know what the problem is? You scare me. - I scare you? - You scare me. You're Tim Riggins. You show up drunk to school. You don't... You got rally girls do your homework for you. You don't go to class. Your relationships last about minutes. How am I supposed to take you seriously if you don't take yourself seriously? Sorry to barge in on you now, don't mean to bother you. I had to stop by and apologize for those smoothies today 'cause that was one dumb ass move. I heard on the radio, record-high sum. I figured I make this big gesture and now you must think I'm one of those in your face football dads, now. So, sorry. That is my apology. - I can't take that. - Oh, come on. That's a nice bottle of scotch and those are Cuban cigars. - If I were you, I would take those. - I'm sure they are, but I can't take that. Can I tell you what I hate? I hate all those bozos on the radio clamoring for your job. All those people, they say you made a mistake building an offense around Smash Williams. Where were those people when you won the State Championship with that strategy? Please! If you have a star like Smash, you build a team around him. Period. - We just need a couple of wins. - That'll shut them up. That probably won't, but it's a start. And what you did with Matt Saracen... That truly amazes me. Well, he's a great talent. That's the thing. He is not a great talent. He is an average talent. He is 5'9"". He runs a 4'7, 9'40, and he has a mediocre arm at best. Only a great coach like you could've ever made it to State with him. - I don't know about that. - I do. That's why I'm here, Coach. My boy, J.D. He's the real deal. He is a great quarterback and I want him mentored by a great coach. And that is why I moved my family to Dillon, Texas. You tell me that you moved here from Dallas just for this football team? For you, sir. For you. You are looking at the next Jason Street. You got a franchise sitting right under your nose. All you gotta do is sniff. - Anyway... - I can't take these. A gift given is a gift given. If you care to pass it on to somebody else, be my guest. I'm looking forward to Friday. Hope J.D. gets some snaps. - Emily, how are you? - Can I have a second? What's going on? You're here late. I just wanted you to hear this from me. I took a position at St. Matthews. Oh, no! Emily, please, no! They have smaller classrooms, more resources. I love this school, but I just wanna have what I need to do my job. I'm sorry, Tami. It's 9:45. I know. I had to stay and... make photocopies of the new budget for the whole staff because the district won't let us pay secretaries' overtime. And you know what else? Miss Walker quit. Cause she's going to St. Matthews, 'cause at St. Matthews, they have smaller classes and they have resources. So that's where she's going. I feel like an idiot. I thought I was gonna go in there with all my great ideas, and... They don't need my great ideas. They just need money. Don't do that. Come here. You'll be alright. It'll be alright. It's early on. years from now, you'll look back and laugh at it. You're just trying to get laid. It's 9:45. Honey... Is this Julie's new schedule? Oh, shoot! She's in this stupid - Munios's English AP class. - It's alright. I signed it. What are you talking about? You did not tell her that was alright. The whole conversation was that she needs AP English class - She is taking some. - ... with Dr. Wells. Should I not have signed it for? She needed someone to sign the piece of paper 'cause she was going to school, she couldn't get in touch with you... she couldn't talk to you, so I signed it for her. Honey, we gonna change the schedule. We can't change it. Dad already signed off on it. Did you not understand the part where I said that you had to be in Dr. Wells English class? They are both AP English teachers, correct? Correct. But as you well know, Dr. Wells is a much more experienced teacher. Today was the last day you could change it. That's why I signed it. Well, you know what's great, babe? The great thing is: I'm the principal. And that's something I can change. So that's gonna be changed, okay? - Mom you can't do... - End of the discussion. - Why are you getting so mad? - Don't you raise your voices. - Did you know you're supposed... - That is the end of the discussion! Come here. Did you know you weren't supposed to be in Munios's class? I'm asking. When you see that car in our driveway, you're gonna be 25. You know what we're looking at, right now? A bunch of white people that can't dance and need to lose all weight. My future, Landry. Right there. Right in front of me. I'm gonna become my sister, then my mom. I don't think I'll be any different, you know? Shut your mouth! Mandy, go ahead. I know we've only been dating for weeks, and, you know... When we started dating, I saw a future for you and me. Here, here... And here in Dillon, Texas, I see you and me having like, or little Mandys and Billys running around. Maybe, maybe less. But, uh... I humble myself, here in ""Seven señoritas cantina"", and I ask you: will you marry me? Will you spend the rest of your life with me? Yes! Honey, honey, don't be blunt. There's a man for you in Dillon right here, maybe in this room. I gotta sit down. Hey, honey. Billy Riggins just proposed to my sister. Congratulations. It's not worth congratulating. They're just gonna have a kid and get divorced. She's gonna spend the rest of her life going after Billy for child support. Look, I love my sister. I do. And I want her to be happy, and hope she will be. But I don't wanna end up like her. And the thing is, is that I am good at maths. I'm good with numbers. I would be great at business. I want that for myself. I want that so badly. I'll do anything to go to College. The thing is, vice-principal Trucks, he thinks I'm a moron. I know you're the principal now and I'm so proud of you for that. I know you're super busy, but... I need your help. Come on in, honey. Come on, come on. You're late. You're not dressed. What's going on? I'm not gonna do this anymore, Coach T. Well, you're not gonna do what? Pretend like I got a shot in hell of getting a scholarship. Playing football again. This is over. You let me tell you something... Look, I appreciate everything you've been doing, but the truth is, I'm never gonna be who I was. I gotta start living my life as Brian. I'm never gonna be Smash again. All right, Brian. It's your decision. Thanks for everything, Coach. I had the best time of my life on this field. Miss Colette... Here's my application for the University of Texas. I'd appreciate your thoughts. Also, I'm gonna be running for students council president. Here is my petition with all my signatures. One more thing. Don't tell me that I can't get to college ever again. If I don't get in, then you can call me an idiot. But I don't wanna hear that from you again. See, I don't accept that fate for myself. And I'm gonna do everything in my power to avoid it. Hey, hon. You were right... about the all Julie thing. I should have spoken to you about that beforehand. Well, I think that's true. You know, I wouldn't have done that myself the way you did, but... she needed to have more conversation, I know I wasn't available for that. Thank you for the apology. I don't want you to be mad at me on big opening night. I can never be mad at my wife. It's a damn principle. All right. I just got to get back to work. See? I'm not mad at you. Is that a new computer? Didn't they just get new computers that year before we arrive? Couple years ago, these are networks so we can communicate in house. Well, nice for you. How is it so cool in here? It feels like it's 68. It's the way I like it. It's the way I like it. The long dry season is over, folks. We are finally back under the lights, and we are ready to play some football. Set! Matt Saracen lines up on the center. He steps back, and pitches up to Riggins. Riggins has it, he's got room... He cuts up in the middle. He runs in the second area, puts his shoulder down, and Riggins has smashed his way through the second area, and the Dillon Panthers are in the red zone, play one. Saracen back. He answers to Riggins, he comes inside, Oh, big stiff arm. He clears another tackle, Riggins running like a man possessed, he's in the barn, folks! Touchdown, Panthers! Saracen over the ball. Hut! Here's the snap, he brings back. Oh, Saracen, he's gonna keep it! Nice moves on the inside, he's picked up some blockers, and it is a touchdown for Matt Saracen! It ends up to Riggins, in the middle. He's got one man to beat! Oh, he's airborne! Touchdown, Tim Riggins! He ain't not Smash Williams, but Tim Riggins is smashing everything in his path. It's a brand new year for the Dillon Panthers, and Coach Taylor is putting on a clinic, here tonight. Coach Taylor is taking out his starting backfield. They've done an absolutely outstanding job, tonight. And here he comes, folks. J.D. ""young gun"" McCoy, the phenom from Big D. J.D. takes the snap. The boy is back to pass, he sets up, and he fires. He throws a strike and completion of the middle. Boy! He's really looking sharp here in these closing minutes. Oh, my God! A perfect pass! Just sent on the wings of angels into the receiver's hands. Ladies and gentlemen, it is Jason Street reincarnated. That boy can throw a foot ball! Did you hear that J.D's dad has donated the Jumbo Tron? Hey, Steve, how are you doing? Hey, Coach. Great win, congratulations. Thanks for putting my boy in there. You know, we always give the other boys a chance once we get one in the bag. - I appreciate it. - You're very welcome. Coach, good job. It's completely digital. It's got 7.1 surround sound. It's the newest thing. It is just a beautiful Jumbo Tron, I'm telling you. Tammy Taylor is the brain child behind all of this. I think we should give her the credit. The Jumbo Tron! It is gonna bring us national attention to you. Can I talk to you for a quick sec? - Sure, excuse me. - Alright. Just a quick sec. Yes, Ma'am. You know what? I couldn't sleep, last night. I know, it's hot. It's the hottest... It wasn't because of the heat, it was because I can't stop worrying about all the things school needs. School needs basic, basic things, like... teachers, for one. You know, and pencils, and chalk, and textbooks. - We need these. - I know. I'm totally supporting of the academics. Last year, we did the bike sell, we did the keg sell. You know, we did, I think, 3.000 on that heavy duty thing. We can do that again. We're gonna get those teachers. I've decided I'm going to reallocate the Jumbo Tron funds to academics. No, wait, Tammy, the funds have been... I've checked with the district. It turns out, according to the laws, the principle has the final jurisdiction over the allocation funds. In the past, the way we've always done is... This year, it's gonna be different. I'm telling you there is not gonna be a Jumbo Tron. I'm sorry. We'll talk later if you need, okay? Hey, can I steal her for two seconds? - Sorry, guys. - Go ahead, bye. - How are you? - Good. Two things: thank you... for kinda keeping my ass in gear cause I know I needed it, and I kinda owe tonight to you. And two... I'm okay if you don't tell anyone about us. As long as this works with you. I just told Buddy Garrity I'm gonna reallocate the Jumbo Tron funds to academics. Thank you, everybody! Thank you, James. James Hent for West Texas, ladies and gentlemen! Now... Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen... Great moments of Panthers! Get in! You realize this is the wildest sport in history, right? - It's yours! - My point, Coach. You wanna work at the Alamo Freeze, I don't give a damn! Go ahead, work there. Look me in the eye, tell me you don't wanna play football. I didn't say I didn't want to, I said I can't. I don't buy that crap. I lost my scholarship, I'm slow, and no school wants me. How's that? I don't know how it works. Maybe you have to change your game! Humble yourself, I don't know! But I can promise you this... We can figure it out. If you want this, I will help you get it. Into college, and playing football again. And I can promise you I won't stop... until you get there. Can I ask you why this means so much to you? 'Cause I need something good to happen. There is nothing wrong with your knee. Man, if you want this, it is waiting for you. I can't want it for you."
15,2001, Uprising,American,Polish Jews imprisoned in the Warsaw Ghetto rise up against the Nazi German army in 1943.,5.6,tt2557478,"My generation, we were born into war. Giant monsters attacked our world. We called them 'Kaiju'. They came through the breach. A gateway to another dimension, at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. They were sent by an alien race on the other side... the Precursors. We fought back... built in our own monsters. Jaegers, giant robots. So big they needed two pilots to run them. My father was one of them. He sacrificed himself to help save the world. I am not my father. It's been years since we won the war and closed the breach. Most of the world has recovered... but few coastal cities never did. And the world is still picking up the pieces. But some of us live better in a broken world. And squatting in half a mansion... is better than paying for some crappy apartment. Now in the relief zones you have to get creative, you have to hustle. Somebody else might eat your breakfast. And your cookies. And your damn hot sauce. You know out here we place a different value on things. The Pan Pacific Defense Corps usually looks the other way... as long as you don't go poking around where you don't belong. Say like a, decommissioned Jaeger scrape yard. Big risks mean big rewards... and nothing pays more than stolen Jaegertech. Plenty of nutcases out here trying to make their own Jaegers. But they need the parts to do it. So if you can steal what no one else can steal... you can live like a king. Are you sure it's in here? Power cords are stripped before they get decommissioned... but sometimes they miss the tertiary plasma capacitors. And that's a big score. This one is still holding the charge. You better hope so. OK. Just calm down. Just not get excited. I'm just playing the odds here. You cheated Barada and while you escaped another Chau in Hong Kong. - That was a misunderstanding. - And stole from me, my own backyard. Now I'm stealing for you. Cycle of life. - You good? - You deliver... Yeah. - We good. - Okay. - Let's get rich. - Nice. Target locked. Where is it? Hey man, uh... Just a little situation. It says it's here. It is supposed to be right there. Well, you know what, Let me just figure this out. Somebody please kill this guy for me. Target moving. No, it's here. You wait, wait. Some one else is in here. Someone else has the capacitor. Now, let's go. Come on! Jake! Jake! Wait! Son of a. Go, go, go! Spread out. Come on, Jake! - Boss, he went through here! - Hurry up. I see him. I see him. Jake, Jake, Jake. Nice try. - Yeah. We're good! - Jake. Jake, you son of a... Target locked. Hey. Get back here. Target moving HELP WIN THIS WAR. END OF THE KAIJU WAR. KAIJU WAR IS OVER. SHAO PLANS TECH TAKE-OVER. Jaeger MARK VI. - How old are you? - Old enough to kick your ass. Let's take a second. Back off. Back off. - You build this to yourself? - What do you think? I think I can sell your little toy for a whole lot of money. Scrapper is not a toy and she is not for sale. The man holding the pipe says yes. So listen up... - You led them here? - It's impossible. What the hell now? Come on. Come on. Come on. Yes. It works! Hey! Get out! What are you doing? - No no. Stop. - Where is it? Don't touch that. Hey! What are you doing? - Where is the other one? - The other what? The other cray door, A Jaeger needs two pilots. Scrapper is small enough to run on a single neural lobe. Either you get out or you let me pilot it. - Get out. - Screw that. - Told you she is not a toy. - You're gonna get us killed. - I can get us out of here. - I just got us out. Oh my God. That's November Ajax. Pilots of unregistered Jaeger, this is the Pan Pacific Defense Corp. Power down and exit your comm pod. No, no, don't give up. You give up way too easy. That's what they think. Stop. You are in violation of code ten, section 14, operation of an unregistered Jaeger. - Hang on. - I am hanging on. Hang tighter. Seriously? Stop. See? I just outplayed with November Ajax. - No you didn't. - I did. Didn't. OK. What do you got? And I'm not getting out. - One of those ion cells redundant? - No. - They are now. - But we need that. Get up to Ajax's head. - What? - Go! Power down... Low power warning. Twelve percent. - I told you we needed that. - It worked didn't it? Eleven percent. How long before Ajax can reboot its systems? About that long. Power down. This is your final warning. Alright! Lets go. Look what you did to my Jaeger you jerk. You should have let me pilot it. Oh like this is my fault. You compromised my command center. Wow. Your command center? Sorry, sorry to hear that. And you had no place to come in and try to tell me what to do. I go where I want. This is different world. Look where we're at. Your top lip and your bottom lip need then need to meet and become friend. They need to close up. Alright? Shut up! Shut up! Conversation done. Junkyard baby. - Why did you build it? - What happened to the shutting up? Says you wasn't gonna sell it. What the hell was you gonna do? Rob a bank or something? I built her because one day they are gonna come back. The Kaiju. And then do I'm not gonna be stuck waiting for some one else to come save my ass. Not like before. You, let's go. I do not wanna talk about it. It's ridiculous. I have the right to silence... Hello, Jake. Here we are again. Just a stretch of bad luck I figure out. Your father used to say we make our own luck. Yeah, well. Dad said a lot of things. You were arrested in a rogue Jaeger. Hold on a second. That wasn't my Jaeger. This little kid, she's about... You have priors. This is serious. That's why I need my big sis to help me get the hell out of here. Just one last time. They are not going to let you just walk. But there might be another way. OK. See, that's what I wanna hear, let's talk about. The other way. Lay it on me. What do I gotta do? Re enlist and finish what you started. I am not doing that. I am too old to be a cadet. I don't want you to be a cadet. I want you to help train them. Train who? Train what? I am not training no damn kids. The transport is standing by to bring both of you to Moyulan. Both of us? You and your new recruit. Mako. I can't believe she just hologramed me. PPDC PILOT ACADEMY. MOYULAN SHATTERDOME CHINA. Yeah. Look, I didn't have a choice. I know I get it, but why me? Why do they want me for the program? You built and piloted your own Jaeger. These people like that kind of stuff. So then why am I just a cadet and you get to be a ranger. Valor Omega. Oh my God, that is Valor Omega. Scrapper. You gotta be kidding me. I didn't believe it when they told me you were inbound. - How you doing, Nate? - It's Ranger Lambert. Yeah, with love. Well, This is a military base. You remember how that works.. Ranger Pentecost. - And you must be Amara Namani. - Yes sir. Ranger, sir. Let's get you squared away. And and, try not to steal anything while you're here. Did that haircut just call you Pentecost? As in 'Bad ass Stacker Pentecost'? Pilot of Coyote Tango, hero of basically the whole world? - It's just a name. - Yeah, really cool name. Simtraining starts at 0600. If you are late, you miss the day. You fall behind, you'll be on the next transport back to wherever they found you. That's Titan Redeemer. And Bracer Phoenix. She is a man rig. Saber Athena. I love Saber Athena. She is the fastest in the fleet. Did you know that? Warning: stay clear of lift. Which one is yours? Gipsy. - You pilot Gipsy Avenger? - He used to. Until his co-pilot got a better offer in the private sector. Jules Reyes, J-Tech. Amara, cadet. Jake. - Ranger, apparently. - Heard a lot about you, Pentecost. - You know you still hold the record. - What record? Shut up. So how did they lure you back? I mean it couldn't have been the pay. Oh yes, it's a long story, but if you if you want to talk about it, then we can meet up... She is busy. Eyes front, Pentecost. - Come on, Renata, not the face. - Sorry man. I raise you, two shower chips. Fold, Ilya. You need all the showers you can getting there. I have musk. What you smell is musk. Ranger on deck. Audio system deactivated. Cadets, this is Amara Namani. She will be joining you in sim training right and early. And this is ranger Pentecost. He will be helping me instruct you... until I can find a new co-pilot to replace Ranger Burke. Anything you like to add? Nothing you want to hear. Malikova, get Namani squared in and prepped for training. - Yes sir! - As you were. Pentecost. We are gonna be trained by a Pentecost. So? Not like he was the one who died helping close the breach. He has never been in an combat. Renata, ready for round two. Yo. Ilya, do you see this? - So, where should I... - Heard you built your own real Jaeger. Yeah, actually Scrapper. I operated her too, with this solo unit... If you want to put junk together, be a mechanic. Moyulan is for pilots. - Hey come on. I got you. - Thanks. Jinhai. Ou-yang Jinhai. So you and Vik, already buddies huh? Vik is short for Viktoriya, but you don't wanna call her that. Yo, what's her problem? Took her shots to pass the entrance test. Don't think she likes how you landed here. Hey, it's not my fault. Recruiters never come around back home. - Hey. Do you know any Russian? - No. I'll teach you something. Calms her down. Come on, let's get you squared away. Hemispheres out of alignment. Warning. - We need to reconnect. - I know! I'm trying! MAGLEV deactivated. - I just can't get this. - That sucked. Drift simulation terminated. AMARA FAIL SURESH FAIL. You know, when I heard you gave November Ajax a run for his money I thought we might have something here. Now I'm not so sure. How am I supposed to drift in this thing? It smells like feet. I didn't ask for excuses, cadet. You put her up against Kaiju that almost killed veteran pilots. Doesn't make any sense. Well maybe, she is not the only one who doesn't belong here. See Nate, I know you have a problem with me, but come on, she is just a kid. So were we. That's the point. You make stronger connections when you are young. And that kind up on makes a better drift pilot. Yeah, I remember the pitch. Thanks. Ryoichi, Renata, you're up. Show our new recruit how it's done. What the hell are you wearing? Jules loves it. Yeah she told me it's nice to finally have someone with style around here. Can't blame the girl. I am sexy. - You want a drink? - Sure. Thanks. - Ice cream is up top. - Yes. So one more time around huh? Prove your old man wrong? No, I just came back to see if your chin implant ever settled in. Oh I think it settled in quite nicely. Yeah, it's very commanding. Kids must love it. Jake. These kids, they look upto us. We gotta show them that we can work together. Well... The war ended ten years ago. You might just need to let that go. Just whoosha... After you understand, you gotta make your... Yeah... Sorry me. You have to understand your enemy's objective... to know you defeated them. We still don't. No, I can help you out with that. See I'm thinking it has something to do with them sending giant monsters to kick the crap out of us. No, the Precursors won't send Kaiju to flatten a few cities if they were trying to wipe us all out. Look, me, I don't have a problem with you man, but I had to make a choice. It was between your pretty face and prison, I chose your pretty face. Well, I'm touched. How many damn toppings do you need? Leave my toppings be man. Don't mess my damn toppings. So the cadets got like what? Couple of months before they graduate? - Six. - OK. I tell you what... Every time you want to say something soldiery to them, I'll just nod... or like ""Yep, what he said"". Then before you know it, they get to be pilots. - And I get to get back to my life. - Great! You may get sooner what you think. - How's come? - Big dog and pony show tomorrow. SHAO and her team are presenting this new drone program they have. - Could make us all obsolete. - Sounds like my get out of jail free card. You know, you confront all you want... but you and I both know you could have been great. She doesn't do the whole handshaking thing. Doctor Newton Geiszler, head of research and development for SHAO Industries. That's a nice firm grip you got there. That's a much better look on you. I guess it is better than prison stripes. Barely. I'm sorry? Is this him? It's gotta be him. Right? You're Stacker's kid. Hey! I am Newt. I was a big fan of your fathers. Amazing speechwriter by the way. Do you ever hear one where he canceled the apocalypse. - Newton. - Hermann. I was hoping you would be tagging along. I could use your help in an experiment I'm working on. This will only take a moment. I know how busy you are. I do not want to impose, but... Come on. You can't impose on me. I mean... We have been inside each others heads right? We saved the world. We have drifted with a Kaiju. You know, if we hadn't yanked that Intel right of Kaiju's brain Raleigh would have never been able to close the breach. That was you and that was me. Technically more me, but we can make this quick, or... Deployment. Of Jaegers. Their deployment to battle it takes too much time, you know The amount of damage a Kaiju can inflict before they even... Ah here. I think I found a solution. You know I can never read your... Rocket thrusters? Huh. Yeah, no. There is no fuel in the world with that kind of boost-to-mass ratio. Not from this world. - Now. - Is that Kaiju blood? Exactly. I've discovered Kaiju blood is highly reactive when it's combined with rare earth's elements. - Cerium, lanthanum, gadolinium. - I know that. You can't be fooling around with stuff. You're gonna blow yourself up. No one knows more about Kaiju morphology than you. - If you could just take a look. - No, Hermann. I gotta stop you. Look, none of this matters. Once my boss's drones are approved, deployment time. This is gonna be a non issue. Within a year buddy, we're gonna have drones everywhere. So you won't help me? Look, why don't we talk it over dinner in my place, OK? You can finally meet Alice. I don't need a hot meal Newt. What I need is a solution, to a specific problem. That's me. Bud, I'm sorry. Duty calls. It's been nice catching up. Newton. I still get nightmares about what we saw when we drifted with that disgusting Kaiju brain. But it was hell of rush, wasn't it? I know, I'm terrible. Yes, we shared a lab together. Oh some crazy idea about thruster pods on a Jaeger. The man is completely harmless. Could you say that again, and this time about percent slower? I said, don't make me question your loyalty. Understand? What's to question? Look I barely talk to that guy anyway. My drones are the next step in Jaeger evolution. The system I designed process its commands through a quantum data core. This means that a single pilot can operate the drone remotely... from anywhere in the world. As soon as the council approves the deployment, based on Secretary General Mori's final report... the days of struggling to find and train drift compatible pilots will be a thing of the past. And you think a bunch of desk jockeys are better than us? We are not here to shut you down. Cooperation between our programs has never been more vital. - If there are any questions? - Yeah, I got a question. We are pilots, not a bunch of office workers. And now we're shouting. There is no need to shout. That was slick. So how long till they order the shutdown so I can go home. I don't trust that tech. Not yet at least. Oh. It looked pretty good to me. Remote systems can be hacked or compromised. You got the key vote right? So there you go, it's your decision. I wish I could just go ahead and approve them. Nearly half the counsel is backing Liwen. They aren't going to like my decision. Who cares what they like, and what they don't like? I tell you what? I'm gonna go with you. For moral support. Plus I wanna get out of this place. I'm glad you offered, because I already requested Gipsy Avenger as honor guard at the counsel summit. You know Gipsy is Nate's right. His co-pilot works for Liwen now. He needs a new one. One that you already know is drift compatible. Alright, I'll do it. I've got your back. But I wanna be there when you tell Nate, cause I just want to see his face. He's gonna be so pissed. You see he's gonna stand there like ""Yeah, I don't think you belong in a Jaeger, Jake. Get out of my Jaeger. I am handsome and sexy."" He is handsome. He is sexy. Thank you, Jake. SYDNEY AUSTRALIA. Welcome back. Lots of sunshine today. The kick of the weekend, the city... Good afternoon everyone. Peter Overton broadcasting from the Nine Studios in Sydney with the latest... So far police say at least, officers injured. Kaiju-worshipers in black masks throwing bottles and rocks. PPDC security in right gear are attempting to weaken... FLAGSHIP Jaeger ARRIVES AT PPDC SUMMIT. Gipsy Avenger, this is Marshal Chan. All you have to do is stand there and look pretty. - Stay focused and try not to fall over. - Roger that sir. Go for drop. In three, two, one. Drop it. Jake. Drift alignment unstable. Relax. It's coming back to me. You sure? Ion cells activated. Hey Nate. We're in each other's head, remember? So I would appreciate it if you'd stop thinking about Jules. Not gonna happen. Well, you still thinking about kicking my ass. Not gonna happen either. It's gonna be a long day. Incoming transport. - Warning. - Gipsy to Command. You reading this? Gipsy, this is Command. Be advised that we have a rogue Jaeger. Pilots of unregistered Jaeger, power down and exit your comm pod immediately. I repeat: power down and exit your comm pods now. Missiles fired. - Low powe warning. - We are loosing power. Jake, that Jaeger's power reading is same as yours. It's jamming our comms. - Nate. - Power's up. - What do we do? - Follow my lead. Mako is hit. - We gotta move. - Activate the gravity split. Mayday, mayday, mayday. This is Charlie 052. We have been hit and we are going down. - Going down! - Sending. - Mako. - Jake. Wait! Drift alignment failing. Come on, Sarah. Do something. This stupid brain thing. So I'm not really good at emotional stuff, but... I really am sorry about your sister. Half-sister? Yeah, her family died during the Onibaba attack. My dad took her in. And she was my sister, my family. Why are you out of uniform? Just had a lot in my mind after Sydney. Guess I just wanted to be comfortable. Don't let Ranger Lambert see you in that. He might take the stick out of his butt and beat you with it. I think I'm safe. So they still using Sarah. I can't drift with her for some reason. All the other cadets have been training for years and I... - I hate feeling like the slow keg. - You gotta relax. Or you're just grinding gears. I'll help you out. Got it, coach. - Do not call me a coach. - Alright, sensei. Concentrate. You have to make a good connection. You can't do that if you're yapping your gums. - You ready? - Ready. All right. See if we are drift compatible. Come on girls. Get it. Shoot. Come on. Neural load is exceeding limit. Stay focused Amara. Remember: the stronger your connection, the better you fight. That's it. Jump to me, honey. Jump. Come on. Don't hang on to the memory. Just let it flow back through you. Amara, jump in there. Yeah come on. Get together. Ready? One, two, cheese. Got it. Wanna see? Wait a sec. Amara, you have to let it go. Just listen to my voice. Amara! - Amara! - Daddy. Come on Jump. - Amara! Amara! We need to break the drift. - Jump to me. Come on! - I'm scared. Baby. I'll catch you. I promise. Come on. - Come on, Amara. - Jump. Take it off. You okay? I was there. I felt it. I felt it too. Jake, it's me. You there? Yeah, I'm here. Meet me in the lab right away. The marshal wants to see us. Alright, on my way. You okay? - What is it? - A message from Mako. She was trying to send it from her copter right before it went down. It's a data package. High density. Obsidian Fury was jamming comms. How could her signal get through? - It didn't. At least not intact. - So it's gone. Gone is relative in digital round mate. Running a modified factorial algorithm I might be able to reconstruct a few megabytes. There. Is that a Kaiju? I am checking with PPDC Kaiju archives. No matching in the database. Keep looking. Whatever it is, it was important to her. I want to know why. And I want to know who was piloting that rogue Jaeger. SHAO INDUSTRIES SHANGHAI, CHINA Hey, sorry I'm late. I thought you were still in Sydney. That's great. I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic. Yeah, no, I am calm. This is great. It's the timing of everything. With that attack and all it feels a little... I was there. I know what happened. Neural connection terminated. Yeah, I guess they do. If you look at it sideways in they maybe you can say that. Sorry, what are you... What is going on here? is a... Get it done. Not a problem. Which... You don't think there's a way? Alright. Well, then you're fired. OK. How about that? Or maybe you are promoted. I don't know. We'll see how it goes. Just get it done. Give me this. Hey honey, I'm home. Sorry I'm late. Things were... Things were crazy today, with what happened in Sydney. All those people. It was not pretty. My boss almost got killed. That could have been bad. Maybe I guess. I don't know. That would have been great actually, that one is all over me. I mean I can't get a break from her. I am ranting. Enough about work and enough about her. Really I should be focused on you. How about we have a little fun in the bedroom? How was your day? Oh that's great. Yeah that's exciting. What's that? A little pick-me-up? What can I say? You are right by mine. They are calling it Obsidian Fury. He's never been a rogue like this. News feeds they are posting a dozen Jaegers at the memorial. When I die, I want that many send me off. Your pops gonna make you work with boobs when you wash out. Jaegers do not show up when the boob guy does. - Your dad works with boobs? - He is a plastic surgeon. He does not just work with... I'm not gonna wash out. I'm gonna be a pilot. Still, you die, man, they post one Jaeger on your funeral. Maybe half a Jaeger. I heard this is where they found Amara in half a Jaeger. It was a whole Jaeger. It just wasn't very big, Viktoriya. Bigger is better. - Kiss my ass. - What did you say? Kiss my ass. Am I saying that right? I have worked everyday in my life to be here. You didn't do anything. You are just picked up from street like garbage. Do you know where I learned that? - On the street, you bitch... - Ranger on deck. - She jumped me. - She does not belong here. I don't care. When I first joined the Corps, I was like you. Worse, I was nobody. But that woman we lay to rest today, Mako Mori, she said, ""Whoever you are..."" ""the minute you enter this program, you join a family."" ""And no matter what they do, no matter how stupid they may act sometimes..."" ""you forgive them and you move on."" So you start believing in that, in here. Then you will start believing it in a Jaeger. The marshal is looking for you guys. Says Gottlieb has found something. It isn't something, it's somewhere. Severnaya Zemlya, of Siberia's tiny peninsula. - What is in Zemlya? - Nothing anymore. A facility roughly in this location was used to manufacture Jaeger power core... during war but it was decommissioned years ago. Why would Mako be trying to tell us about an abandoned factory in the middle of nowhere? Sir, a mission to take Gipsy avenger to see what the hell is out there. SEVERNAYA ZEMLYA SIBERIA Scanning. Looks like Mako's message was a dead end. This place is abandoned. Wait a second. - Getting some weird readings. - Incoming. Take out his legs. We gotta get out of here. Plasma canon. - I think we've pissed him off. - Good. - You remember our old move? - Hell yeah. - He looks hurt. - Go for his power core. Warning. Pilots of Obsidian Fury, Get the hell out of your comm-pod. What the hell is that? It's definitely Kaiju. A secondary brain used to control the hind quarters. - How do they get into our world? - There hasn't been a breach in years. The sensors would have pick that up. I don't think there was a breach. Kaiju flesh has a distinct radioactive signature particularly to the anti-verse. This specimen does not. So... You saying that it's from our universe. The genetic fingerprints indicate terrestrial modification techniques... probably engineered from Kaiju flesh left over from the war. Precursors didn't do this... Humans did. That punk of slimy crap was piloting obsidian fury? We gotta get a look inside. - Inside? - That thing is part Kaiju. Come on guys. When are we ever gonna get a chance to see something like this again? Never, never would be good. - You guys can stay here, I am going. - No I'm not. Amara! Guys, we should not be in here. It's fused all the way to the system. Like muscle tissue. That's how it was able to move like. Cool. Yeah cool. Working with boobs are sounding better and better. You shine the light over here. Yes, just pull on the guts of that weird Kaiju. - What is it? - I think it's some kind of... - I told you not to... - Go get help. We are so screwed. The security takes over. We are done. Is Jinhai OK? He's got some scar, but yeah, he'll live. The Marshal plan on probation, Meilin and Suresh too. - They bleak wrong, all of them are out. - No it's not their fault. - I talked them into... - Sorry, I talked to the marshal, but you are dismissed from the program. - Never belonged to here anyway. - Really? I used to say the same thing a long time ago. Still don't. - Why did you sign up? - We were at war. My dad was leading the charge and I thought maybe I could see more of him. Maybe even drift with him. One night me and Nate got into it. It was over something stupid. I can't even remember what. So, I climbed in an old Mark just to show him, I didn't him to be a great pilot. - That is pretty dumb. - Yeah. How far did you get? - Seven steps take or leave. - How far did you get? About steps. And I blacked out from the strain. And the first thing I saw when I woke up, was my dad. He's standing right in front of me looking stunned. What did he say? He said that I was out of the program, he said I didn't deserve to be in a Jaeger. Look he said a lot of things. A year later, my dad was gone. I didn't get a chance to prove him wrong. And more importantly, I could not get a chance to prove it to myself. You listen to me. Don't let what other people think of you define who you are. You won't like where that takes you. Do you understand? And keep your head up, then you might just be as good looking as me in this type of situation. This face is set up well. Beauty is a burden. You will be alright. SHAO Industries. What? Obsidian Fury has tech in it made by SHAO Industries. That's impossible. Jules and her team scanned every centimeter of that Jaeger. Insulating meta-materials wound counterclockwise in the shunt cabling. SHAO is the only company that winds in that way. Amara, are you sure about what you're telling me right now? I stole a ton to make scrapper. I thought it might be important. Yeah. Thank you. SHAO Industries. - They don't even have a bio division. - Not that we know of. The cabling could have been stolen, just like in Amara's Jaeger. We're gonna need more than that to connect it to SHAO. What about Newt? He'd have access to internal records and shipping manifests. Alright. Go see him, keep a low profile. I have a mission? Finally. We will take over Newt to the Marshal. SHAO INDUSTRIES. This isn't fair. I'm sorry. You don't deserve this. It was my fault. This is on me. Amara. The next Jaeger you build, make it a big one. System online. And we have delivery at 100, people. A 100. That's the way that it's done. OK? I told you we could do it and we did it. - Malfunction. - I losing up link to drone 375. Why? Figure out why. We will take what we know to the council in person. Prepare transport. Give me a second. Get to Gipsy. Go! All pilots, man your Jaegers and engage the hostiles. You can do it. You cool? Yeah, super cool. Just stay calm. I know. I'm heading up. On my way. Hermann, what are you doing here? How did you get in? I do have PPDC credentials, and besides everyone else seemed to be little bit preocupied occupied with the killer drones your boss just set off. - She used you. - No. She lured you with money and a fancy title. And while you were basking in the glow, she took your research and she twisted it. Help me stop her, Newton. Help me save the world, like old times. Sorry, technically you helped me last time. Let's get that straight. Fine. Help me help you save the world. What do you say? I say... I say. Don't shoot! Damn it, why can't I get this language? What is happening? - Are those Jaegers? - No they are Drones of SHAO Industries. - What are they doing? - I don't know. They just went crazy. Get back to your quarters right now. Yes sir. Go, go, go! - Get the hell out of here. - Come on, get up. Really? Now? - Come on hurry! - Little help, Hermann? Learn how to use a gun. Thank you, Newton. You're done grabbing me, let's take care of the drones right? Everyone get out of the lab, or I'll shoot you. I'll shoot you twice. You are officially fired. Get out. - What do we do? How do we stop this? - There is a back door Hermaan. - To what? - To the drone sub routine. I added a sub routine just in case I wanna get in here and poke around down the road. Sneaky bastard. I know right. CONFIRMED INITIATING BREACH PROTOCOL What did you just do? What I have been planning the last ten years. I am ending the world. HONOLULU, USA. HONOLULU, HAWAII BREACH DETECTED. HONG KONG, CHINA BREACH DETECTED. ANCHORAGE, ALASKA BREACH DETECTED. All pilots, breaches detected. Drones in the field are opening multiple breaches across the pacific rim. Why would you do this? Why would I do this? Well, I guess I want it. Normally, it's not really my style. I don't know. Maybe I hate you over treating me like an insignificant little joke of a man. Maybe that's why he did it, Hermann. I did it. That's it. There you go. There is the problem. I am not just feeling totally myself these days. You. Precursors. Very good, Hermann. You figured it out. And as usual a step behind. Newton, you are a good man. You must stop. - Hermann. - You must stop it. - Please, you must fight back, Newton. - I am not strong enough. He is not strong enough. None of you is strong enough. I'm sorry, Hermann. They are in my head. Oh hey, boss. What the hell are you doing here? I told you to get to quarters. - All the doors are blocked. - What do we do? I mean 38 of your company is fully automated. It really wasn't very hard to re allocate a little over here and a little over there. And slipping a little Kaiju surprise without you noticing. Stop. Wait. Newt has no control over himself. It isn't him. It's the precursors. They must have infected his mind when we drifted with the Kaiju. Shut up. Stay here. We are gonna try and get to Gipsy. - Are you ready for this? - No you? - On three. One two... - Hello anyone there? - Gottlieb? - Jake, thank god. We are under attack. It isn't her, it isn't Liwen. It was Newt. The precursors. They infected him. They are controlling his mind. Gottlieb, can you get him to disable the drones? No, he got away. Gottlieb, shut them down. - It is trying to lock you out. - Feedback loop. What the hell is going on, Gottlieb? Gottlieb, Shut them down, or we're gonna die. Shut them down. Liwen has disabled the drones. The breaches are closed. I repeat the breaches are closed. - Oh no. - Oh no, what? Three Kaijus have gotten through. South Korea, Russian coast and the East China Sea. - Two Cat fours and a Cat 5. - Copy that. Get back to the dome. We need all the help we can get. - You guys okay? - Yes Ma'am. What do we got? The reports are still coming in but the drones attacked Jaegers in SHATTERDOME across the rim. Alright! How many Jaegers do we have here? Operational? Gipsy avenger, barely. That's it? - Yeah. We need more Jaegers up and running or this is gonna be a short fight. Even if we can, all of our pilots are dead or severely injured. One disaster at a time. Let's just focus on those Jaegers. Namani. Come over here. I need you to help Jules with the repairs. Can you do that? Said I was kicked out. I'm kicking you back in. She's pretty good at turning junk into Jaegers. You good with that? Hell yeah. Right we got a lot work to do. And not a lot of time. We got incoming. I brought some help. Hakuja, Shrikethorn and the big fellow... Raijin. I took the liberty of assigning the designations. Well the spiky guy and the big idiot are moving away from the cities towards the ocean. What does that mean? Maybe they are trying to link up with Hakuja in the East China Sea. I bet Newt would know what they are up to. If we can get it out of him. Yeah but we have to find him first. Any Jaegers closer to those Kaijus than us? What was left of the Chin-do and Sakhalinsk drones tried to intercept. Emphasis on tried. - I am afraid we are all alone. - There is gotta be something here... Something in the East China Sea. Maybe that's not where they are headed. Pull up a map of Kaiju movement from the war. - Pushing data to main display. - Well you know something we don't? You said we need to understand our enemy's objective, to know we've beaten them. What if the Kaiju weren't blindly attacking our city during the war? What if we were just in their way? Right here. Mount Fuji, Japan. Extrapolate for Hakuja, Shrikethorn and Raijin. - Mount Fuji? But why? - Rare earth elements. Mount Fuji is a volcano rich in rare earth elements. Kaiju blood reacts extremely violently with rare earth elements is the basis of my fuel thruster experiment. - That sounds bad. That's bad, right? - Very. Mount Fuji is active. A geological pressure point. Based on their blood to mass ratio, the Kaiju reaction would cause a cascade event. Igniting the Ring of Fire around the Pacific Rim. Billions of tons of toxic gas and ash will spill into the atmosphere... wiping out all life. And finish terraforming the earth for the Precursors. We can't let them reach Mount Fuji. I'm gonna check with Jules for the Jaeger repairs. Even if we had a hundred Jaegers, there is no way to intercept in time. - What bout your thruster pods? - No no no. They are not ready. Can they be? Well in theory. Maybe with your help. Gottlieb, what does that mean 'in theory'? Today... it means 'yes'. Power partially restored in sector 2. Saber Athena, Guardian Bravo and Bracer Phoenix are good to go. Not a lot to work with. Liwen keep passing fury-tech in Gipsy that might help. - Prep everything we got for deployment. - OK. Don't get yourself killed. You either. Well that's confusing. Let's just stay focused. We got four Jaegers against two Category-4s and a five. It's better than just Gipsy. - We still need pilots. - We have them. If my dad was here, he would probably give you a big speech, make you feel invincible. I am not my father. I am not a hero like he was. Like Raleigh Becket and Mako Mori. But they didn't start out that way. They started out as cadets, just like you. We remember them as giants because they stood tall because they stood together. It does not matter who your parents are, where you came from who believed in you and who didn't. We are a family now, and we are earth's last defense. This is our time. This is our chance to make a difference. Now let's mount up and get it done, do you understand? Yes sir. - Jaeger pilots, do you understand? - Yes sir. - Do you understood? - Yes sir. Then help me save the world. Let's do this. - System online. - Initiating neural handshake. - Establishing neural link. - Amara, jump in there. Neural handshake strong and steady. So... How does it feel to be in a real Jaeger? Bigger is not bad. All Jaegers, sound up. Go and go for launch. - Guardian Bravo, go. - Saber Athena, go. - Bracer Phoenix, let's go already. - Copy that. - Command, we are go for launch. - Roger, Gipsy Avenger. Ignition in ten seconds, nine, eight... seven, six, five, four... three, two, one... ignition. Warning: Exceeding structural limits. What the hell? My grandmother used to play it for me. Keeps me calm. What about me? I am not calm, man. I knew it would work. TOKYO, JAPAN. - Gipsy to Command, targets acquired. - Roger that, Gipsy. Everyone in the city is secured in underground shelters. You are clear to engage.. Solid copy, going hard. Bracer Phoenix, on me. We'll take Raijin. Roger that, Gipsy. Saber Athena, Guardian Bravo, you take the other two. Copy that. It's our turn to save the world. - Let's hope so. - On my mark. Three, two, one, mark. Fire! Gipsy, Raijin's face plates are absorbing the hits and throwing the energy back at you. Let's see it absorb this. How many buildings can this thing take? Shrikethorn inbound. Guys, we could use some of the help over here. - Right Now. - Copy that, Saber. - Vik, take out Shrikethorn. - On it. Saber Athena, Guardian Bravo coming to assist. Activate the Arc Whip. Yeah. That's nice. You better run. These things ain't that tough. Bracer Phoenix, watch your six. Hostiles inbound. Copy that. OK. Giant robots again. Alright. Real original guys. I am not impressed. We've got movements, multiple hostiles, three kilometers south-east. - Liwen, are you reading this? - That is one of my automatic factories. It was Newt. He is in Tokyo. Locating his position. - Hostiles, one foot away and closing fast. - All Jaegers, brace for contact. Disengage and brace for contact. Let's go alright. Go, go, go. Go baby. Where are they going?

16,2008,Bangkok Dangerous,American,"Joe (Cage) is a professional freelance contract killer who works strictly by the rules; never socializing outside his work, staying secluded in quiet spots, never interacting or meeting with his handlers and always leaving on time without a trace. He usually hires young pickpockets or small-time criminals as his local help, whom he usually murders after the end of the job to prevent any identification. He uses multiple aliases and also has middlemen between him and his handlers. He also carries a watch to perform a hit in specific time and correctly visualizes his every target.
After completing a hit in Prague and killing his current help, Joe travels to Bangkok for an assignment to assassinate four people for notorious Bangkok crime boss Surat, whom he never meets. Joe occasionally provides insight via voiceover narration throughout the film. He hires a local Thai pickpocket named Kong, who has simple English knowledge, as his go-between in Bangkok, a condition of the contract being that the gang will never meet Joe. Contracts from the Bangkok gangsters are passed to Kong one by one via a nightclub dancer, Aom. Joe's first execution in Bangkok is done on motorcycle; when the target car stops at a red light, Joe kills all the occupants with a machine pistol.
Kong retrieves information about the second target, again via Aom, and the pair become friendlier with every contact. Before Joe executes his mission, Kong informs him of the target, Pramod Juntasa, another notorious gang lord and Surat's rival crime boss who acts as a sex trafficker, buying young girls from impoverished parents and selling them after sex deals. Joe sneaks into the target's penthouse and drowns him in his pool. Unsatisfied with Kong's assistance, Joe contemplates killing him, but after a brief confrontation when Kong is ambushed by local gangsters regarding a briefcase containing information files of Surat's/Joe's targets, he instead decides to act as Kong's mentor and trains him for self-defense.
Midway through the movie, Joe meets Fon, a deaf-mute pharmacist, with whom he becomes intrigued after a brief consultation. Joe later returns to the pharmacy to invite Fon out for dinner. Soon after Joe falls for Fon and meets her mother. The affair is cut short when he shoots and kills two assailants in Fon's presence. Blood splatters on Fon, and she runs off, trembling and traumatized by the violent deaths. Feeling betrayed, Fon cannot forgive Joe and ends their relationship.
Before the third kill, the gang attempts to identify Joe, and he warns them off. For the third execution that takes place at the Damnoen Saduak floating market, Kong assists Joe. The kill does not go as planned, and the target, a playboy and a criminal underworld associate, nearly gets away but Joe manages to catch and assassinate him. Before beginning his last mission Joe visits Fon, presumably to say goodbye. She initially ignores him but as Joe begins to drive away she runs after his car.
His fourth target is the Prime Minister of Thailand, who is revered by many. Joe is about to make the kill when he has second thoughts, is spotted, and escapes through a panicking crowd. Meanwhile, the gang has abducted Aom and Kong with plans to execute them. Joe, now a target, is attacked at his house by four of Surat's henchmen. He uses explosives to take them out and is faced with the choice of rescuing Kong or leaving the country unharmed. Joe decides to rescue Kong, so he sets off to the gang's headquarters with one of the half-alive attackers.
Joe goes to the gang's headquarters, kills most of the gang including Surat's underboss/bodyguard (who is blown into half by explosives), and saves Kong and Aom. The fearful gang leader flees to his car with three other accomplices. Joe spots him and shoots the gang members, then gets into the back seat with Surat. As the police arrive at the location, Joe realizes he has only one bullet. He puts his head adjacent to Surat's, puts the gun up to his temple and pulls the trigger, killing himself and Surat.
An alternate ending to the theatrical version shows that before Joe kills himself in the original version, Kong steals a police car and comes to his rescue. He kills Surat and runs to the stolen car (although he is shot once in the arm). After eluding the police officers, they hide in a neighborhood a few meters away from Surat's headquarters. As locals come out to investigate the commotion, Kong reveals that Joe is the man who killed Surat. They help him recuperate while one local remarks that Surat was a very bad man, adding that his death marks an end to his crimes and atrocities in their place (with the words ""it's good that he is dead"") Kong then takes Joe to a boatman and gives him his passports, so that he may flee the country. Joe thanks Kong for his assistance, and gives him a bank account number with ""a bonus"", stating that he was a good student. Joe then departs, with the camera focused on Kong (from Joe's perspective, similar to the original ending).",5.3,tt0814022,"My job takes me to a lot of places. It's got its down sides. I sleep alone. I eat alone. I'm used to it, though. I'd like to meet someone. But it's tough when you live out of a suitcase. I go where I'm told... do what I'm told. I shouldn't complain. The work is steady. The money's good, but it's not for everyone. My name's Joe. This is what I do. You're late. Sorry, Mr. London. They closed Chechov bridge. You're leaving? I need the phone. I can help with the bags. No, I can handle it. If you ever come back, I can, I can use the money. Thank you. Goodbye. I was taught four rules... One, ""Don't ask questions"". There is no such thing as right and wrong. Two, "" don't take an interest in people outside of work"". There is no such thing as trust. Three, ""Erase every trace"". Come anonymous and leave nothing behind. Four, ""Know when to get out"". Just thinking about it. Means it's time before you lose your edge, before you become a target. So you look for the right opportunity. Nothing too risky. Get the money and disappear forever. This is it. Four hits, one location. The lastjob. Purpose of your visit to Bangkok, Mr. Vincent? Holiday. Bangkok. It's corrupt, dirty and dense. All my clients have one thing in common. They feed off the people. There's big money in misery. Where there's money, there's competition. and the guy paying me usually wins. How will we know when he's arrived? We'll know when he arranges the pick-up. You're sure he's reliable? The Russians swear by him. How do you swear by... a man you've never met? We don't know him. He doesn't know us. It's better for us that way. It always starts the same way. Just like I was taught. Secure a safe location. Somewhere off the beaten path where you have privacy. But you stay invisible too long, the human race starts to look like another species, so you venture out, you observe, and then you return to your invisible world, like a ghost.

Can you teach me? - Teach you what? - Everything. I could help you. Please? Show, show me. Again. Again. Again. Again. Again. Again. Good. That was your first lesson. Why didn't I kill him? Maybe it's because, and this is strange, somehow, when I looked into his eyes, I saw myself, so I became his teacher. The best way to defend yourself is to know when something's about to happen. So, you have to learn to read your surroundings. See that man in the red jacket? What man? You're living in a city of mirrors. Store windows, glass office buildings, polished steel, eyes in the back of your head. Aaah! Eyes in the back of my head, huh, boss, huh? I got you now, boss. I'm not your boss. I'm your teacher. So I call you How is he bad? This man? He hurts many country girls. From the north He buys them from their parents? Same thing like devil, ah, this guy.

Don't ask questions. He's a very good man. Same like you... Political assassination wasn't in the contract. So, there are two ways to go. Refuse the job and walk away now, or, do the job and walk away rich. The truth is almost anyone one can take out a politician. That's not the hard part. The hard part is getting away with it. He wants more money. It's a big job. There's risk. Yes. He knows who we are. If he were caught, it could lead back to us. What about the messenger? We should erase every link. The girl too. Just to be safe. I'll take care of it. - I'd better go. - He can wait. He's counting on me. Kong! Be here tomorrow at six P.M. Last job? Yeah. - Bad man? - Bad for somebody. See you tomorrow, boss.

Thai people love him When the nightmare becomes real, you don't hesitate. You don't think You just run. Anyone in the way goes down. It's pretty simple. You are the target now. Leave the country, or you are going to die. Where is Kong? Where is Kong? Why the fuck you care? He's my student. Where is Kong? Surat. He's with Surat. ...exactly which direction everybody's running doesn't seem to be running away Still no answer. Maybe he killed them. He's only one man. This is taking too long. When will he show up. There he is! Let's go. What's that noise? Where is he? Do you see him? I can't see anything. Kong, where is he? I had to tell them. Take her to the street. I cleared the way. I got one more job. Surat? He's very bad. Don't wait. Just go. Shoot him. Shoot him. Get off! Go and fight! Shoot him!  LeapinLar"
17,2013,Oldboy,American,"In 1993, alcoholic advertising executive, Joe Doucett, becomes intoxicated and before passing out, sees a woman with a yellow umbrella. When he wakes, he finds himself locked within a hotel room. His unseen captors provide him with food and hygiene items, but do not explain why he is captive. Joe sees a news report that says his ex-wife Donna was raped and murdered and he is the prime suspect, while their infant daughter Mia was adopted.
Over the next twenty years, Joe works himself into shape, compiles a list of all those who would want to imprison him, and writes letters to eventually give to Mia. One day, he sees an interview with Mia, who says she would forgive her father if she ever saw him.
Joe is drugged shortly thereafter, and wakes to find himself outside with a cell phone and a small amount of money. He spots the woman with the yellow umbrella and gives chase, but ends up running into Marie Sebastian, a nurse that offers to help. He refuses but takes her business card. Joe goes to his friend Chucky, and explains what has transpired. While there, Joe gets a call on his cell phone from a man calling himself the Stranger, mocking him. Joe spends a great deal of effort to determine if any of the men on his list are the Stranger, but they all prove to be innocent. Joe collapses from dehydration, and Chucky calls Marie to help. While he recovers, Marie is taken emotionally by Joe's letters to Mia, and offers to help him further. She is able to help identify a Chinese restaurant that Joe's food came from while imprisoned.
Joe follows a delivery from the restaurant to a warehouse where he was imprisoned, and meets Chaney, its owner. Joe tortures Chaney into confessing that the Stranger arranged for his imprisonment. On return to Chucky's bar, Joe finds the Stranger there with the woman with the yellow umbrella, his bodyguard Haeng-Bok. The Stranger says they have kidnapped Mia, but if Joe can determine his identity in 46 hours, he'll let Mia free, give Joe $20 million in diamonds and proof of his innocence in Donna's murder, and the Stranger will even commit suicide.
Joe learns that Chaney and his men are seeking revenge by attacking Marie, and he races there, only to be captured by Chaney. Just as Chaney is about to beat him savagely, the Stranger calls Chaney and offers to pay him for Joe's release, and Chaney lets them go. Marie recognizes the ringtone from the Stranger as the theme song to Evergreen Academy, where Joe attended. At the school, they look through yearbooks; Joe recognizes one student, Adrian Doyle Pryce, and recalls tormenting his sister, Amanda, for her promiscuity, which led to rumors that their father, Arthur, had incestuous relations with them both. As a result, Arthur moved them to Luxembourg, but later murdered his wife and Amanda and committed suicide. Joe calls Chucky with the name, and Chucky confirms Joe's guess that the Stranger is Adrian. Adrian, who has cloned Joe's phone, overhears the conversation, and enraged by Chucky's contempt of him, kills Chucky before Joe can arrive. Joe hides Marie in a hotel for her safety, and they end up having passionate sexual intercourse, unaware Adrian is watching through hidden cameras.
Joe goes to Adrian's penthouse, defeats Haeng-Bok, and confronts Adrian. Adrian congratulates him, giving him the diamonds and escorting him to where Mia is. However, Adrian asks Joe to think why he had let Joe go in the first place, and shows that the interview with Mia was all a set-up, and ""Mia"" was a paid actress. Adrian shows Joe that Marie is really his daughter, and had engineered events to this point to make Joe feel what it is like to lose everything. Adrian then fulfills his promise and commits suicide. Shaken, Joe writes Marie a letter saying they can never see each other again, and leaves her most of the diamonds, using the rest to pay Chaney to return him to the captivity of the hotel room.",8.4,tt0364569,"Presented and produced by SHOWEAST In association with EGG FILMS What?

I'll be out in one month's time. I'll be out of here. I'll be out in a month. In exactly one month. I'll need money when I get out, so what should I do? Should I steal or rob? What shall I eat first? Kimchee soup? Barbecued eel? Anything but fried dumplings. But where am I? With all the car horns, it must be the city. The most important thing is what floor I'm on. What if I break through the wall and I'm on the 52nd floor? Even if I plunge to my death, I'll still be getting out. I'm getting out. In one month, I'm getting out. Picture yourself lying in a field. When you hear the bell... ..you will turn your head... ..and look down. You will see an endless field of green grass. The sun is shining brightly... ..there's a cool breeze. It's a human being. Don't stop me! Mister! Even though... ..I'm no better than a beast... ..don't I have the right to live? Mister. Even though... ..I'm no better... ..than a beast... ..don't I have the right... ..to live? Yes. Yes. The alley with the phone box was just here. Now there's a block of flats. So he releases me onto the roof. What a fool. I want to tell you my story. Die later. What? What the hell? I see. Now I'll tell you my story. The reason... ..I want to die is... Hey! That's a female human being. Laugh, and the world laughs with you. Weep, and you weep alone. My home is gone. I cannot call my friends or relatives. Because they say I murdered my wife. I am a fugitive. You dickshit! Dickshit... A new word. Television doesn't teach you swear words. Can years' worth of imaginary training be put to use? Apparently, it can. Rock Bream. Oplegnathus fasciatus. Lives in the warm waters of coastal reefs. This fish has weak reflexes, but can resist powerfully when caught in a hook. In the Kyungsang Province, its offspring... What is that smell? Don't bother asking me any questions. I don't know anything. Yes? I said... I want to eat... a living thing. Oh... right. Long time no see. This is my first time here. Maybe I'm wrong. But she looks familiar. You look very familiar. Have we met before? ""Search for the Best Chef."" ""Thursdays at 6:30 on MBC."" ""The youngest female chef of Japanese cuisine."" Oh, that? They said the ratings are low, but someone must watch it. Women's hands are usually warm, so they cannot make sushi. Well, you certainly know your stuff. Who are you? Do you like your clothes? Why? - Why did you imprison me? - Who do you think I am? - Yoo Heung-sam? - Wrong. - Did Lee So-young pay you? - Wrong again. Lee Jong-yong? Kang Chang-suk? Hwang Joo-yeun? Kim Na-sung? Park Jin-woo? Im Duk-yoon? Lee Jae-pyung? Kuk Su-ran? - Who the hell are you? - Me? I'm a sort of scholar. And my field of study is you. A scholar studying Oh Dae-su. An expert on Oh Dae-su. Who I am isn't important. What's important is ""why"". Think hard. Study your whole lifetime. School has finished, now it's time for your homework. Keep this in mind.: ""Whether it be a grain of sand or a rock, in water they both sink alike. "" Let me ask you one thing. You hypnotised me in there, didn't you? What did you do to me? I miss you. Come quickly. Here you are. It's alive, OK? I'll go and slice it up for you. I must be a different breed of woman. My hands are very cold. What is she doing? Sir. Sir, wake up. Keep this in mind. ""Whether it be a grain of sand or a rock... ..in water they both sink alike. "" Are you awake? Is all this true? That fever remedy works well. Why did you faint if you've done so much physical training? A lack of vital sunlight leaves one depleted of vitamins A and E. Thus, one's immunity to influenza is weakened. Do you always talk like that? The lock on the bathroom door is broken. Don't get any bright ideas or I'll gut you like a fish. What's this? Suppositories. You fainted, so how else could I give you medicine? Can years' worth of imaginary training be put to use? Apparently not. That was an unforgivable sin. I brought you back here and then turned you down. I can see why you're angry. I really can. You know, I brought you here because I like you. But... You don't even know my name yet. It's Mido. You see... ..later on... ..when I'm really ready... ..I swear on my life that I'll go through with it. That song in your diary, The Face I Want to See , that will be the sign. When I sing it, get ready. I may try to resist you again in the heat of the moment. But no matter what, don't stop. Just give it to me! Give it... ..to me. The ants... Do you still see them? Do you still feel that way? Yeah, if you're alone, you see ants. People I have met who are very lonely have all hallucinated about ants. I tried once to work out why. Ants move around in groups, you know. So I suppose very lonely people keep thinking of ants. Although I have never done that. She called from overseas five or six years ago, asking if her dad had come back. She doesn't even know that he killed her mother. She has hardly any relatives, so she calls us. Her Korean has got worse. I think her Swedish foster parents are both doctors. You journalists must know... Dae-su... Is he really still on the run? Your daughter's address is on the front and on the back is a map of your wife's grave. Eva... Stockholm... Eva... Do you want to call her? Shall I call her? Shall we visit the grave tomorrow? No, first I have to kill that bastard. BLUE DRAGON Well? I haven't tasted it yet. BLUE DRAGON So? Did it taste the same? I could taste food from 100 restaurants... ..but I will never forget the food I tasted for years. BLUE DRAGON Shall I create an ID for you, so you can log in? Do you have a favourite film or song? I've already been talking... ..to him... ""The Count of Monte Cristo""? There's no one by that name here. HOW'S LIFE IN A BIGGER PRISON, OH DAE-SU? Who are you? Who are you? THE LONELY PRINCE IN THE HIGH TOWER. Who is he? I don't know who he is. I just chat to him sometimes. We talk about sushi. Where are you going? Where are you going? You are not to be trusted. - VIOL... - BLUE DRAGON Violet Blue Dragon... What does that mean? Why did they order from a place so far away? I've already passed five Chinese restaurants. I think my lungs are on the verge of exploding. You there, tell your cooks to put less scallions in the dumplings. OK. - Leave it there and go. - Yes, sir. We don't take on anyone who uses bodyguards. Some companies specialise in that. You should go to them. We just take the small fry. If the stay is over six months, transportation is free. Yes, of course. Why did you imprison me, you... ..dickshit. In our business on floor 7½ client confidentiality is our livelihood. I am going to avenge myself for all years. Each tooth I extract will age you by one year. Keep still. Do you want to talk? I don't know... I didn't see his face... I made recordings... OH DAE-SU All those who are blood-type AB, raise your hand. Go. Shoo! He has lost a lot of blood. Piece of shit. Is he dead? I can't seem to get through today either. Now I have become a monster. When my vengeance is over... ..can I return to Oh Dae-su? Mister, are you alright? Look at all this blood. What happened to you? Saewoon Apartments, Eung-am, building 8. Take care of him. Thank you. Not at all. Well, then... Farewell, Oh Dae-su. Farewell... ..Oh Dae-su. Farewell. Farewell. The bastard you hate, but don't dare kill. The bitch you detest, who deserves a fate worse than death. We are at your service. Won't he go crazy if he's locked up for a long time? Well, if you don't want that, we can drug his drinks. There's a thing called 'Risterdal solution'. It's a reliable drug used to treat schizophrenia. But it depends on the length of the treatment, so how long will he... 15 years. Is that possible? What did he do? Oh Dae-su, you see... ..talks too much. Go to sleep. Tomorrow, you will visit Joo-hwan's internet cafe. Sit wherever you like. Joo-hwan. Oh Dae-su, you see... ..talks too much. Have you heard this voice before? Who loathes me this much? Those women you've had... I don't know the names of their husbands... LOGON: MONSTER MIDO. Who's Mido? A little girl who cries a lot. Joo-hwan... Did I... ..really talk too much? My friend... Maybe you should... ..look for the criminal among people you're close to. SEARCH: EVERGREEN CHAT TO EVERGREEN? CONGRATULATIONS, YOUR CASE WAS AUTOMATICALLY DISMISSED YESTERDAY. But please remember this... Open quote. Like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter... Like a bird from the snare of the fowler... Free yourself. Close quote. Who are you? You bastard! I decided when I was a prisoner that if I got out, I would trust no one. If I met anyone suspicious, I would invent a secret, only known to the two of us. That ID, Monster, is a trap I designed to catch him. You let a stranger into your home. Who are you? Who's Evergreen? I tracked down that Evergreen ID and found the owner's details. - Are you ready to jot it down? - Go ahead. It's Su Dae-oh. Does the surname 'Su'even exist? - Address? - Saewoon Apartments in Eung-am. Building 7, flat 407. Actually, life in a bigger prison does not suit me very well. Evergreen. Who are you? Is that what you wanted to ask? No. You must find that out for yourself. Come on, it's a game. First "" who?"" Then ""why?"" When you know the answer, come and see me. I'll mark your work. You have until July 5th. Oh no, only five days left. Too short? Chin up. If you succeed, I'll kill myself instead of Mido. That's right, Mido. I'm going to kill every woman you love until you die. Well, you're notorious for not protecting your women anyway. Wow, you're strong, Mr Monster. Yes, you are the monster that I created. But you will never find out why if you go through with this. You have been curious for years... Are you still going to kill me? Sit down there. Ah, the tooth torture! You won't have enough time. I have a pacemaker for my weak heart. When it was put in... ..do you know what I said to the doctor? ""Dr Hopkins, give me... ..a remote control to turn my motor off."" ""Pardon? Why?"" ""So that I can kill myself. Easily. At any time."" ""I'll pay you an extra 100,000 for this."" What a dilemma. You want to kill me right now, but then you won't know why you were imprisoned. You want to torture me, but I say I'll kill myself first. Revenge? Or the truth? What a problem for you. I've been watching over you for years. I've faired well thanks to you. I wasn't bored or lonely. Seeking revenge is the best cure for someone who has been hurt. Try it. The loss of years, the pain of losing your wife and child, all this can be forgotten. Once again, revenge is good for your health. But... What happens after you've had your revenge? I bet that hidden pain probably emerges again. Are you there, Oh Dae-su? Oh Dae-su. Long time no see. Hasn't she been tied up too long? You left her door open. Save me, Dae-su! I can't. I'm going to die. This dentist is very good. Keep still. Keep still. What's his problem? You see... ..they say that people shrivel up because of their imagination. So do not imagine anything. You'll become brave as hell. Now here comes the real thing. Sir, I'm glad you told me about this place... ..but I haven't even started yet! Let's go. Let's go now. Let's fight. Let's fight. - What a tough guy! - Your hand. I'll chop off your hand. You touched Mido's breasts. Let's get out of this dump. So do you trust me now, you bastard? It looks hard to accomplish. I looked into it. The reason the bank refused to pay 270 million was not due to any building irregularities. They have internal problems. So I don't think we'll have any trouble. Chairman Choi's clients' shares are at 25 ... Dae-su. Yeah? Did he really say that he'd kill me? Yeah. Because I'm the woman you love? Dae-su. What? Where is my love? I'm getting lonelier in the nights The words you send with your eyes I can feel with my hand So many nights have passed My heart is going to you As I shed my sad tears You're the face I miss. They packed up their stuff and left in a rental car. Also, Mido called the restaurant and left her job. Let's go after this is done. You should get some rest today, sir. I can't even sleep. Because I am lonely. Mr Han. Do you really think... ..that Mido has fallen in love with Oh Dae-su? Already? Dae-su! It hurts so much. But I'll endure it. You must understand. How did you hold out for years? There's always a way. Do you like it? You do like it, don't you? I want to make you feel good, Dae-su. You need not worry about the future. Imagine nothing. I am grateful for all those years spent in that prison. If I was the old Oh Dae-su, would Mido still have liked me? He could only have known that I said I would chop off Mr Park's hand by putting a bug on us. And he knew where we were by tailing us. I'VE BEEN BUGGED. PLEASE FIND IT. You know, maybe he freed you because he has fun watching you run wild seeking revenge. And he'll never tell you why, so he can toy with you forever. Is that why? Evergreen Press, online printing system. Evergreen Pasta and Pizza. Evergreen Services, for security, parking, cleaning. Evergreen Tree Garden. Evergreen Old Boys. Sangnok High School alumni homepage. Evergreen Secret Diary, Jung Sang-rok's personal site. Norwegian Wood, Evergreen... WELCOME TO EVERGREEN OLD BOYS THE SANGNOK HIGH SCHOOL ALUMNI HOMEPAGE. I should be locking up now. Can I just look at the records for the class of '79? It's dark. Put the lights on. Take your time. LEE WOO-JIN Joo-hwan? Let me ask you something. Do you remember Lee Woo-jin from school? I think he went to study in America. Lee Woo-jin? I don't know him. So is that the bastard's name? How did you find out? I looked through all the school yearbooks. I need more than just a name. Got anything else? Look at the student records. Do you know Lee Soo-ah? She was in our year. Lee Soo-ah? She died. - What classroom was she in? - Room two, I think. She was in my room. Next to yours. So what about her? Why is there no photo? She died. That must be why. How did Lee Soo-ah die? Yeah, you wouldn't know. She died after you moved schools. She went to the Habchun Dam alone and fell into the water. She bit the dust. One week later, they found her bloated body in the water. - What was she like? - Her? She was a total slut. On the outside, she acted like a lady, but inside she was just a filthy whore. The rumour going around school was that she'd fuck anyone. I should have got in there. I also heard that her family was filthy rich. Her grades were good, too. But the worst thing was that she was a total slut. God, this is such an old story. Dae-su, I can't remember because it was so long ago, but that Soo-ah, well... Joo-hwan, what is it? Joo-hwan, is something wrong? Oh Dae-su. My sister... ..was no slut. You must believe that. You got rid of your bug so I had to come all the way here. To eavesdrop. That's why Joo-hwan is dead... ..because of you. OK? You bastard, I'm coming for you! I'm going to kill you! You son of a bitch! We're not open yet. Come back in an hour, please. This place was recommended by someone with six gold teeth. Mr Park? I had to move because of you. To celebrate the occasion... ..I installed a new TV. Do you like it? It's got so many channels. Great, isn't it? Some prisoners don't want to leave at all. You lived in a place like this for years, Dae-su? After years it felt like home. Come on, I don't need your money. My enemy's enemy is my friend. We threw away the hand because it rotted. I've missed you. Bastard. You'll pay for this. So why did you bring me here? If I don't return after July 5th, let her go. While I was locked up here, I remember someone visiting me. What did that person do? Was it three times? I put a hypnosis-inducing drug in your water. Sodium barbiturate? He's a genius! WATERWHEEL HAIR SALON That's rubbish. Even though it was a Catholic school, those rumours wouldn't have killed her. There was probably something else. Could she have been pregnant, maybe? I really don't think Soo-ah was like that. She was such a pure girl. I know she never went with anyone. But she did go out with someone back then. Do you want to know who he was? I haven't got a clue! Choon-shim. You knew Lee Soo-ah, didn't you? Who was her boyfriend? You don't know? You silly cow. You don't know because friendship means nothing to you. Shut up. Who would know? Who? Joo-hwan? What? Yeah, I know him. But why would he know? Yeah? Really? OK. I'll call you back in a bit. Well... She said it was Joo-hwan who told her the rumours and that you should know more than anyone. Ring, ring. Move aside. You'll get hurt... ..if you get in the way. OH DAE-SU Good Lord! You rascal. Put it out! I'm leaving today. For Seoul. So just you leave me alone, missy. You good-for-nothing! You're Oh Dae-su, aren't you? And you are... I heard you're popular with the girls. You know what rumours are like. I heard you're really funny. Say something. It's not good to be stuck with one image. OK, there's this father and son. They went to the swimming pool and... See you later. TAKE CARE FUCKHEADS OF YEAR 3, CLASS 3. - Come on. - Wait. - Come here. - No. Come here. OK, OK. Satisfied? - Lift this up. - No way. - Lift it up. - No. What? That tickles. Give me those. What are you doing? Let me see. What are you doing? - Let me see. - Stop it! Go away. Was it really Soo-ah? Are you sure? I don't know her name. I just know that she's in your class and she rides a red bike. Have a good trip. See you in Seoul. Where are you going? I've got a date with Choon-shim. I'll kill you if you blab to anyone. No way. You got locked up for years just for saying that? Is that such a crime? ""Whether it be a grain of sand or a rock, in water they both sink alike."" That's Lee Woo-jin's attitude. So, what's the significance of July 5th? That's the day... ..Lee Soo-ah died. It's over now. You were fighting for the truth, not for revenge, weren't you? Now, we'll run away where Woo-jin can never follow us. I can't end it like this. Vengeance has become a part of me. But you don't even know where he lives. ""Like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter... ""Like a bird from the snare of the fowler... ""Free yourself. "" It is taken from the Book of Proverbs, chapter six, verse four. And Evergreen... ..said he lives in a high tower. So six and four... ..must be floors. Fourth floor. Sixth floor. Or the 64th floor? P? Penthouse! Please insert the code. What would you like me to pray for? Wrong entry. Please re-enter. Wrong entry. Please re-enter. ""Dear Lord... ..please let me... ..meet a younger man next time."" Please make Woo-jin... ..kneel before Dae-su... ..and beg for forgiveness. You slept with your sister. Let's go upstairs and talk. Get him! Just talk. That's better. You slept with your sister. So refreshing. And I started the rumours. That's why your sister died. Looking in the mirror reminds me of that day. How about you? Erasing my memory and telling me to find the truth was cowardly. I won... ..so die like you promised. Did you think you'd forgotten that day because you were hypnotized? Really? Do you know the real reason why you can't remember? It's because... ..you just forgot. Is that not exciting enough for you? Well, it's true, you just forgot. Why? Because it wasn't important to you. Your rumour got so out of hand, that the next rumour was that Soo-ah was pregnant. My sister got sucked into that rumour and began believing it. So her periods stopped and her belly began to swell. Fascinating, isn't it? Imagine how a girl would feel to carry both her child and her nephew. Do you understand now? Your tongue got my sister pregnant. It wasn't Lee Woo-jin's dick. It was Oh Dae-su's tongue. Is that why you killed your sister? Imagine how a boy would feel, fathering both his child and his nephew? You were probably afraid. Afraid that everyone would know once the baby was born. After you killed her, you realised it was a phantom pregnancy... ..so your hating me... ..is understandable. They said Soo-ah died alone at the dam, so who took this photo? And what about the date, July 5th? This is no fun. I'll just finish what I was saying. Listen carefully. My story is really exciting. Ever heard of post-hypnotic suggestion? You suggest something during hypnosis, then it's performed in your wakened state. Still haven't worked it out? You let a stranger into your home. Who are you? What about you, you bastard? We hypnotized both of you. One fortunate thing was that, compared to others, both of you were receptive to hypnosis. Isn't this fun? One word gets you pregnant. Another makes you fall in love. But no matter how receptive you two were to hypnosis, and no matter how good a hypnotist Miss Yoo is, getting people to fall in love isn't easy. Do you know how we did it? Your first suggestion, of course, was to go to that restaurant straight after your release. Next, to react to the mobile phone's ringtone. When you heard this, you were programmed to say something. Who are you? Do you like your clothes? And Mido was programmed to react to the man who would say this. When she touched your hand, your reaction would be... Your gravest mistake wasn't failing to find the answer. If you keep asking the wrong questions, you'll never find the right answer. It's not, ""Why did Woo-jin imprison me?"" It's ""Why did he release me?"" Once again... ..why did Woo-jin release Dae-su after... ..15 years? LAUGH, AND THE WORLD LAUGHS WITH YOU. WEEP, AND YOU WEEP ALONE. Mr Han. Mr Han! Mido... Mido doesn't know? Why did you hide her there? Did you think he'd hate me just because I cut off his hand? Didn't you work out that it was a trap? How can you protect your woman with that brain? I've secretly been raising Mido since she was three. What's wrong with you? Mr Park's hand? You moron. Did you see his new prison? I gave him that building for his hand! Me! Dae-su! In front of me there's some kind of box. He's telling me to open it. It's the same violet box... No! No, Mido, don't. Don't open it, no matter what. Or something terrible will happen. What's in it? You know, don't you? Mido, just wait a little longer. Dae-su will be there soon. I'll be there very soon. Can't you come now? I'm scared. Little Mido, you can wait, can't you? Yes. Very good. Good girl. I'll call you back very soon, OK? Please. Don't tell Mido. What has she done wrong? You know it was all my fault. I have... ..committed an unforgivable sin... ..against your sister. And I also... ..did you wrong. But... ..please leave Mido alone. If by any chance... ..Mido finds out the truth, you son of a bitch, I'll tear you limb from limb. And your remains will never be found. Why? Because I'm going to swallow every last bit. Woo-jin! Please, sir, I made a mistake. Please forget what I said. Sir! Woo-jin! We're Evergreen Old Boys, remember? With the energy of a green pine tree The Great Sangnok High... I'll do whatever you want. I'll do anything. I beg you. Woo-jin, if you want me to be your dog, I will! From this moment on, I am Woo-jin's dog! I'm your bitch. Look, I'm wagging my tail. I'm a dog. I'll guard your house. I'll be your slave. The box... ..just leave it closed. Now... ..what will I live for? Dae-su. It hurts so much. But I'll endure it. You must understand. My sister and I loved each other, despite everything. Can you two do the same? Soo-ah. Woo-jin. I know you've always been afraid. So just let go of me. Please remember me. I have no regrets. Do you? This is the whole adventure of my life until now. Thank you for listening to this terrible story to the end. I trust that you will understand my sending a letter instead of talking to you in person. This is because I have no tongue. To be honest, there's no reason I should help you. But there was one thing. I was touched by this last sentence. EVEN THOUGH I'M NO BETTER THAN A BEAST, DON'T I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE? The hypnosis may go wrong and distort your memories. Do you want to proceed? If you're ready... ..look at that tree. The tree... ..is slowly changing into a concrete pillar. You're now inside Lee Woo-jin's penthouse. It's a dreary night. The sound of your footsteps crossing to the window fills the room. When I ring my bell... ..you'll split into two people. One person doesn't know your secret.: Oh Dae-su. The one who knows your secret is the monster. When I ring the bell again, the monster will turn around and start walking. With each step, he will age by one year. When he reaches 70, the monster will die. There's no need to worry. It will be a very peaceful death. Now, good luck to you. What's going on? Look at you. Who were you with? I love you... ..Dae-su.."
18,2002,The Burial Society,American,"The Burial Society tells the story of Sheldon Kasner, whose existence has recently turned to one of quiet anxiety. His workload is mounting as his reimbursement for it continues to diminish, and Sheldon justifiably falls into a deep depression. Despite being a highly unlikely candidate for organized crime, he is drawn into a complicit money-laundering scam that doesn't run as planned. With a two-million-dollar debt on his hands, Sheldon devises a complicated plan: staging his own death with the help of the Chevrah Kadisha, or the ""Burial Society,"" a mysterious group of devout Jewish men who have dedicated themselves to preparing dead bodies for their final resting place. Unbeknownst to Sheldon, the Burial Society sees the incompetent businessman as the only hope for the continued existence of their tradition. As they initiate him into their peculiar, ritualistic world, Sheldon believes his life is leisurely getting back on track; however, the men of the Burial Society may have something else in mind for him.[3]",6.0,tt0312510,"One day, if you're unlucky enough, you'll be confronted by the truth. You'll see your life in front of you and you'll realize just how much you hate it. When that happened to me, I decided to do something about it. No, please, no. I decided to become the person I could be. - I don't give a fuck. - Please, stop, hold on. Of course, once you reach for the brass ring, well, you better hold on because the rest is out of your hands. You know that line from Isaiah they always quote? Yo, where is it? ""He who dwells in the land of the shadow of death upon him the light hath shine?"" Well that's a fucking understatement. That's only the half of it. As you'll notice good old Isaiah never really gets into how hot that light can get. Or for that matter how deep and dark that shadow really is. Well let me tell you, it's one hell of a trip. Please be seated. Yes? Rabbi Fernstein? Yes, can I help you? I hope so. Yes, what is it? I'd like to join the chevra kadisha. The Chevra Kadisha? I'm new in town, I just moved here. I thought that maybe you could speak to them on my behalf. It's completely out of the question. Oh, I see. If you don't mind my asking, being with the bodies, doing the taharas it can be quite, disturbing. I'm sure it's nothing I haven't seen before. Really? And what line of work are you in? Finance. Surely there must be some way? To tell you the truth, in all the years I've been here they've never taken on anyone. I'm sorry I can't help you. What if I spoke to them myself? I wouldn't advise it. - Why are you so upset? - Well, here it is. times now. It's a nonsense. The point I'm trying to make Marvin, is that if we don't all die, we'll miss everything. Oh, what is he talking about again? Money, money, money. Par, pardon me. Yes? How did you get in here? Through the front door I... The, the front door was open. Well it shouldn't have been. Please lock it on your way out. Yeah it was the groundsman, you know, he's always leaving the doors open. - I'm, I'm sorry. I was speaking with Rabbi Fernstein. Rabbi Fernstein, why? You're the fella in banking? Yes, how did you know? Fernstein said someone in banking was asking about us. But didn't he send you away? He said he sent you away. Yes, he did. If he sent you away what are you doing here? I wanna join the chevra kadisha. Why? Are you dying? I don't think so. Is that a requirement? Look Mr... Sheldon, Sheldon Kasner. Sheldon Kasner, I don't want to be rude, but chevra Kadisha material you are not. The meek may inherit the earth, but I don't think this is the place for you. You're wrong. I don't think so. You don't have the stomach for it. Well, what have you got to lose? I mean, it's not like you got an army of Jews breaking down your door to get in. Okay, Sheldon take a pew here. Here. - Ah, I give up. Sheldon, tell me, you read Hebrew? Your ghusl? I do. And your family, the hours they won't be a problem? I'm not married. I lived with my mother, but she passed away recently. You took care of her? Yes. My brother's got his family so he ah-- That's good, that's good. And your job, you have time? - I don't work. - Wait a minute, you said you were in banking. You made that up? No, no, that, that's true, I, I left. What to be in a chevra kadisha? Of course not, I want to make a change in my life. Change in your life? Marvin, you've gotta admit, that's what we were talking about. Alright, you'll do a tahara with us. And then maybe he'll leave us alone. Sheldon, close the door please. Sheldon, tonight, please. Like that, here. Slowly move down the body. That's right and slowly down. That's it, push. A little harder. Why are you here? Why am I here? I was tired of my life. It was time to make a change. You were tired? Yes. Look, maybe we were born in the dark, but it wasn't last night. I don't understand. What don't you understand? You want us to believe that because you don't like you life, you stopped being a speaking in foreign language in the big city to come to a small town to clean up other peoples shit? I was a loans officer at the Hebrew Loans Bank. Then perhaps what I would suggest instead of the chevra kadisha is a new line of work. I'm looking for more. What a coincidence, so are we. Well, well, wait, there's more. Please, there, there's something else. Yeah Happy Hannukkah. My bosses tried to kill me. What? Okay, we're listening. Now this is two million dollars. I know how much it is. Alright, just calm down would you. Good morning. - Don't tell me to sit down. - What the fuck are we doing? - Don't tell me to sit down. - We didn't take the winners cards, just listen, stay with me. We didn't put it in his lap, right? Yes, right. Why is Sam even gonna worry about us? Right, right, right. Well, what are you gonna tell Sam? I don't, what are you gonna tell Sam? I don't, you figure out what the fuck to tell him. He's gonna kill us. He'll probably rip my fucking heart out, is what he's gonna do. - Alright, alright. You're gonna make me... Don't, leave it, don't worry about the phone. Hey, what do you know about Morrisberg Steel? Nothing, what is it? Nothing, don't worry about it. Hey listen, we're in a bit of a jam. Think you can give us a hand with something? I should have known right there that something was wrong. In my years with them, they barely spoke to me. Not since they took over their father, Moshe Lightman Which meant they were either seriously desperate or trying to play with my head. I could never be sure with them. What is this screen? I've never seen it before. - Nevermind that, just watch. This was the network banks used to wire money around the world. But it didn't make any sense. We were such a small operation. I couldn't imagine why we would be on the system. We're looking for a transaction. I can't tell you how it felt. Like somebody else's life. All these strange numbers for accounts I never heard of before on menus I didn't recognize. Gentlemen. Sheldon, grab your coat. What's happening? It's nothing, just let us do the talking. Nothing, it's not nothing. Where are we? We're just gonna see on of our-- - Financiers. - But, what financiers? You know, the ones that give the money for all those loans that your write. That money comes from the Israel Fund. I don't understand. Not exactly. See, these people give us money and we-- And we give it back. You launder money? No, no. We launder money. You're criminals? Who else if not for criminals? Jesus Christ. Hello, gentlemen. So it turns out that while I was writing loans for the local Jewish community, my bosses were getting rich taking in money from criminals and giving it back as legitimate, interest free loans. How long has this been going on? years. years? You, you mean your father? He, he was a... Taught us everything we know. So this place, what was it? Where were you? I'm still not sure. Why did they bring you there? I was about the meet the prince of darkness. The overseer of overseers. The enforcer for the Jewish underworld. Who was he? Sam Goldberg. I never heard of him. Nobody has. - Hey, Sam. - Hey, Sam. Who are you? He's nobody, he just works for us. So, what's going on, Sam? Is somethin' wrong? Morrisberg Steel. What about them? How much does that make? It was like a church. - Maybe... - Only for money. It's where bag money came to be redeemed. Because if you were a criminal, your biggest worry wasn't staying out of jail, it was figuring out how to spend your millions without being spotted by the tax man. And the Hebrew Loans Bank where I worked, it was one of those places where cold, hard cash traveled from the dark into the light. And some of that money had mysteriously disappeared. Two million? - Two million dollars? - That's impossible. The transfer should have gone through days ago. Well, why the hell didn't we hear about this earlier? Apparently, they were unable to reach you. Our phones, they've been out since yesterday. Yesterday, Sam, please. Give us a little time, we'll figure it out. It's probably just some, some inputting error. Well that's comforting. Sam, you don't think that we would do-- I don't know what to think, Jake. One thing I know is I don't have it. So these people tell me. And believe me, they've looked for it. Sam, we'd have to be nuts. Maybe. But who knows? You're father Moshe, it would be unthinkable. But him I've known all my life. You, you're a different generation. No values. You don't go to shul. You live the high life. You're hungry. People do things. What is it the goyim say? White is the gate, and broad is the path that leads to destruction. Because I've known you so long, I've promised them it was a mistake. You have hours. Don't make a fool of me. He said he'd be up here. Why did I have to come? Until this over we're joined at the hip. Sam's probably watching us right now. Don't look around. Even one of us tries to run, we're all dead. Run? You think I'm gonna run? I would if I were you. Well, why don't we call the police? The police, brilliant. Why didn't we think of that? Well, what about to protect us? If we don't find the money, nobody's gonna protect us. Come on, he's over here. Tell us what you did with the fucking money? - C'mon. - You tell us. You must have seen the codes. You must have figured it out. Even dad knew you'd catch on eventually. Why did you think he hired you? He figured you'd be too big of a coward to ever rip us off. I've never stolen anything in my life. Alright, fuck this. No. Come on. - We're gonna drop ya. - I haven't... - We're gonna drop ya. - No! - How's it feel, huh? To have a million purse? - No! No! No, I don't know where it is. - Where is the money? - I don't have any money. - Tell us where it is. - Please. - Shut it. Tell us or you'll drop. - I can't... - You can't get... So what happened? You told 'em where the money was? I didn't take the money. Well, how did you get down? I was saved. Saved? By who. - Give it to us right now. - I'm gonna fucking drop you, right now. - Believe me. - Where is the money? - Talk. - I don't know where-- - Where is it? - Where is it? - You little fuck. What the fuck is that? - What? - What the fuck is that? It's a phone. It's your fucking phone. - I got it, I got it. - Guys? - Get it out. Shut up, don't say anything. Yeah, hello? Hey, shut up, I'm on the phone. Hey, Sam. - Hey, Sam. - How are ya? - It was Sam. - Oh, we're just hanging out. - Shut up. - They found the money. - Where? - You, you found it? - Come on, boys, please? It had been there all the time. It was just an innocent little inputting error. Please? - You mean - Alright? - from a computer? Yep, from a computer. Please. - Hold on. - But hanging there, I saw something. Let me up. I saw everything. I mean, everything, my entire life. If you could call it a life. I don't understand. What was wrong with your life? What was wrong with my life? I was a year old man who was afraid of his own shadow. years like I didn't exist. Like I was invisible. But hanging there, I, I realized something. I'm tired of being scared. I wanna live. I know it doesn't make sense, but I figured this was the place to start. So tell me, these hoodlums, you're done with them? I am. I say, yes. Now you'll find out what you're really made of. Sheldon, come. Easy, easy, nice. Very good. Sheldon, give me your right hand. This knot is nearly 2,000 years old. Since the Kabbalah your forefathers have used the same knot. And two, three, four. Slow, and put this on here. And alright, good, very good. What's he doing? Ah, the pottery is to protect the eyes from the bright light when he wakes up in the promised land. Incredible. What about the twigs? They grows as staffs. To abandon all worldly possessions. It's the essence of rebirth. They're reborn with nothing but the sackcloth on your back and the twigs in your hands, which will grow into powerful staffs. That's what I call traveling light. That's what it is that they are. The preparation for the passage. Removal of all earthly possessions. Where they're going, they won't need them. - Well, hello. - Hi. Come right in. Sit down. And here you are. And you know what to do. I sit and read until Harry shows up to relieve me. And you don't ever, ever leave the body until he is buried. And Jew must be in the company of other Jews. Goodnight. Did somebody die? That's the question. That start to his last mission. He very well disappeared without trace into the netherworld of Beirut's southern suburbs. The only publicly confirmed information... How are you feeling? Come on, Shel. Mm, real matzah balls. Who made this? Who do you think? Amazing. What's amazing? What else can we do? Can't let her starve. It's not right. And you're medicines. Do you have enough for the week? Thank you. This is Sheldon, our newest member. I know your face. Organized crime... You're sure you don't come before? Have continued their search... - I'm sure. - For the second body... We are sure. I'm afraid we are going to go. So soon? Well, I'm afraid so. We have many, many deliveries. We'll see you next week. The money is there on the table. Take all of the cents. cents? Sheldon? Here, take the money. That's alright, you can keep it. cents, God forbid I should lose it. Leave it, Hy. She is old, she doesn't know better. Sure, that will support tahara and Mrs. Graunbaum. Sheldon, tell 'em. Earth to Sheldon? Huh, I'm sorry, what? Tell 'em we should take money for the tahara. - Money? - I said, leave it. I don't understand, what are you talking about? Who do you think pays for the chavurah, hmm? And the electricity? A synagogue, I would think. You would think. It's a small Jewish community. The synagogue does not have that much money. I'm telling you, we should take money for the taharas like a business before we go broke, and we won't be able to help anybody. God protects us this long, he won't stop now. God looks after those that look after themselves. That's very original. In what's now shaping up to be a double homicide. Our sources inside the department have also hinted at the possibility of some sort of organized crime connection here. And so, as divers continue their search for the second body, I'll it back to you, Dan. Execution style murder as Stuart Lightman, the local businessman who disappeared late last week. Also missing is his brother, Jake Lightman as well as Darrel Zimmer, former employee who worked for the brothers. But all we've been told so far... Sheldon? Are you there? Sheldon? Oh, hi. We are sorry to disturb you. There is a tahara to be performed. How did you find me? It's a small town. We tried a phone but there was no answer. Here Sheldon. Sheldon? Are you alright? Sheldon, are you alright? Hey? - Sheldon? - Sheldon, are you alright? I hope you're awake. Finally. Chicken soup? It smells good. That's good because the soup is not for you. I don't know what happened. What happened? You passed out. Gin, gentlemen. I guess I haven't been feeling well. I just-- - Don't worry, Sheldon. It's a good sign. Don't worry. A good sign? You are beginning to feel it. Feel what? The power, it's getting into your blood. You wanted to know how it felt. Now you're beginning to see. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Harry. Sheldon, let's have a talk. First time I met you, I think, no, no, it's a mistake. Now I see something inside you. I see the truth. The truth? For 2,000 years, the chevrah kadisha exists. Through wars, famines, genocide. But what Stalin and Hitler couldn't kill is almost dead now because people forget. That's why he sent you. I don't understand. He sent you to save us. Me? Who else if not you? Why the face? You're, you're expecting a lot. So my coming here, you think it's an act of God? I know. Now you have to work harder. So you can teach others. - Well it's about time. - Jesus Christ, Morry. What are you doing here? Oh, my God. What happened to your face? What happened to my, I suppose that's your idea of irony? Your boss, Jake, happened to my face. That's what happened to my face. Jake, he's still alive? That's an understatement. He says that you killed his brother. He says he wants to know where you are. Oh, my God, you didn't tell him, did you? Believe me, if I had known, I would of. Lucky for you I didn't get your message till this morning. Are you sure you didn't tell anyone? Yes, for fuck sake, yes, I'm sure. So did you Darrel? Did you kill Stuart? Kill him? God, no. You know I would never-- I didn't think so. So nobody followed you? No, Darrel, nobody followed me. I'm not a complete imbecile, you know. I just have one for a brother. So, so what is this place? What, what are you doing-- Look, it's okay, just, just relax. Have a seat. Where, on that? I'd rather stand. This place is a petri dish. And you're the one who's terrified of germs. No wonder you look like shit. It's okay. I'm fine. Everything is fine. Fine, everything's fine? The police are looking for you. Everybody thinks you're dead. Your crazed boss just beat me up. You know, I haven't gotten beaten up since I was 12, and I think he cracked my goddamn bridge, Darrel. Now what's so fucking fine about that, huh, Darrel? I know, I know. Darrel, what is happening? Say something. You know when I was having all those problems at work? - I swear to God. - No! Stop it. - Where is it? - Where is the money? - No, alright. They dangled you off the, I mean, how did you get off, how did you-- For once, just shut up and listen to me. - You little prick. - C'mon, kid. - Where's the money? - Where is it? - C'mon, where is it? - No, please. - You little bitch. - No, you big baby. - No, No. - That's it. Okay, I'll tell you. I'll tell you where the money is. You better not be bull shitting us. No, I'll tell you. Please don't drop me, I'll tell you. What did you tell them? Well, what do you think? I, I told them what they wanted to know. But you didn't have the money. Darrel? You? You? Of course I didn't tell them where it really was. I, I guess I told them where the money really wasn't. And then, well, voila. Fuck me. How much? - Two million. - Two, two million dollars? You're enjoying this, aren't you? Not as much as I thought. Well where is it, the money? Is it here? No, not yet, it's in an escrow account. - But how did-- - That's the craziest party, Morry, it was so easy. How did you do it? I just walked across the office. Okay, Erin, you got the keys? Okay, let's go, et's get outta here. Darrel, make sure you throw out the garbage before you lock up, uh? Sure. And he just left the password sitting there? Why not? Who would possibly take it? Well, how long have you known? Since the beginning. You knew all those years about the laundering, about Sam, about everything? Everything. At first I just wanted to see how far I could get. Well, I guess you got pretty far. Well, no kidding. Before I knew it I was inside of the system. And then all I had to do was just change one of the routings and bam - Bam? - Bam. The money was gone, off in the network with the hundreds of millions of other transactions. Except on the first of the month, instead of some criminals in Latin America or Jersey City getting their laundered money, it goes to me. Darrel, give them back the money. It's not too late. Maybe-- - Morry, they'll kill me. Stuart's already dead. Jake, who knows? If Sam's men get half a chance, they'll... Why do think I did it this way? I can't back out. There's nowhere to go. Look, I know Mom dying hit you hard but... Okay, just what do you think you're gonna do with all the money, anyway? I don't know. I haven't thought about it. Maybe go to some tropical island. Buy a sailboat. What's the difference? Well for one thing, you get seasick in the bathtub. Look, don't you understand? It's not about the money, Morry. I'll have done it. For once in my life, I'll have done something. Yeah, and your life, it'll be over. You won't do well in jail. You know that, right? These aren't the kind of people who call the police. No, they just track you down and kill you themselves, right? Not if they think I'm already dead. What? Well, to do that, I mean, you need to find-- A body? Shel? Shel, come on. You okay? This isn't you. This isn't you. You, you can't seriously think that this is gonna work. It is working. That's what everybody's waiting for, isn't it? For me to turn up dead. Sam will think that Jake did it, and Jake will think that Sam tracked me down. It's, it's perfect. Yeah, perfect. And what about those old men? What if they find out? I know, I know, I'm sick about that, but I... They can't find out. Right? I mean, nobody can. Alright, Morry, swear? Morry? I swear, I swear, okay? Ya putz. And what if they catch on? The coffin is sealed. I'll have four hours alone with the body. They'll never know. And if something goes wrong? It won't. In the morning, I'll collect the two million. Then at night I'll take care of the body. I'll make it look like Sam caught up with me. One blast to the face will destroy any dental records. Then I'll simply disappear. - Good morning. - Good morning. Here you go. Have a good day. Hold it. What is that? Those lousy janitors. You can't trust any of them. Yeah. Goodbye. Ooh, they'll be a change in the weather And a change in the sea But from now on they'll be a change in me My walk will be different My talk and my name Nothin' about me's gonna be the same Change my way of livin' And if that ain't enough I'm gonna change the way I strut my stuff 'Cause nobody wants you when you're old and gray There'll be some changes made today There'll be some changes made Hello. Oh, hi, I'm the super. What, what? I didn't mean to startle you. What can I do for you? I heard some strange noises going on in here. Figure maybe somebody was inside messing your place up. You know, it happens sometimes. Nope. Thanks. Everything is fine here as you can see. If you say so. Darrel? Darrel? Harry, what are you doing here? You're him? I'm sorry? You're him? I mean, don't deny it. I, I thought at first it was a mistake. Somebody who looked like you. No, it's not a mistake. Oh, you gonna kill me then? I didn't kill those people. I knew that was impossible. And the money? That was a mistake also. No, I, I took the money. Look, I wish I could explain. No, please, I don't wanna hear. I know too much already. You have your reasons, I'm sure, and you can share them with God. What about the others? Are you going to turn me in? Ah, may God forgive, I know I should but I can't. Besides, Marvin's quite found of you. It's best if he didn't know why you disappeared, and this way he'll be upset, but... That is what you planned, isn't it, to disappear? I'm sorry. Don't be. Just go. What happened? Do you believe in God, Sheldon? I'm beginning to. That's it, over there. I'm not a monster. No, you are not a monster. I honestly didn't mean for you to be hurt. Or anybody. - God brought you here. He gave you a chance to fill a hole. Instead, you tried to run. You cannot escape God. You cannot escape who you are. What is going to happen? You will be judged. You shouldn't fight it. If you fight, you'll see only monsters coming to tear at your flesh. If you let them, you'll see that they are angels coming to carry you away. And traffic on the innercity parkway is just brutal this morning, Jay. Moving on to the national scene, the manhunt for fugitive accountant, Darrel Zimmer, ended yesterday as the criminal's body was found. The latest victim in a series of organized crime related executions, Zimmer was believed to have been implicated in a nation wide laundering operation. In other news, federal investigators have now... We accept you now boarding on Flight to San Cabos. At this time, would all passengers report and be prepared to board. Please have your passport and boarding passes ready for the attendant. Yeah. Hi. Sir. Here's my ticket. Just gotta get my passport. Jesus. Can I help you? Sir, sir? Sheldon? What are you doing here? Where are you going? Shul, come with me. Please, tell me that you took it. Took what? Last night, when you came to see me. You don't make any sense. I don't understand. You've been drinking? Well, no, I'm considering it. You really weren't there? You're so upset. Tell me, what's happening? Is somebody sick? I've just lost everything. If you need some money to borrow, - No, no, that's not it. - please... So what is it? You were there. I saw you. Tell me that you took the money. You think I stole some money? This is why you are here? No, no, no, Marvin, that's-- You think I took something of yours? That's not it. I don't know anything about your money. I heard some strange noises coming from up here. I figured there must be somebody in here messing the place up. Yeah? I'm looking for the super. Yeah, what is it? Sorry, but a psychic I'm not. No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait. Please, I'm looking for... He was in my room. He said that I wrecked the place. You wrecked the place? No, no, no, I didn't. Black guy, maybe 50. Oh, sounds like the guy in 14. 14? Which way, where is 14? It's upstairs, across from you. But don't bother. He cleared out yesterday. Left all kinds of garbage out. I've been cleaning up his mess all morning. Hello? Hello, Darrel, are you there? Say something. They were just here. Who was just there? What's wrong? They were just here. Sam's guys. They fucking tortured me. Darrel, look I'm sorry. You have to get out. - What? What do you mean? He was here, Darrel. He cut two of my fingers off. They made me tell them where to find you. I, I, I don't understand. That's impossible. They already have the money. They, they already-- - What are you talking about? What, what are you saying? They got the money, Morry. It's gone. What? These guys didn't have the money. They didn't have anything. What do you think they were looking for? These guys, they hacked off part of my hand to make me talk. Darrel? Say, say something. Say fucking something. Darrel? Darrel, they know where you are. You have to get out. You have to get out. Forget the money, forget the money. Just forget the money. He left all kinds of garbage. I've been cleaning up all morning. Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey, wait up. How you doing? Give it back. Stand back. Come on, man. You're not gonna shoot me. Let's face it, it's just not you. I wouldn't know what's me and what isn't. Maybe not, but I do. I've been following you for weeks. I know you-- Jesus Christ. Bullets ricochet, you know? I really don't read the literature. Now stand up. Put your hands on, on... On my head? Perfect. Thanks. Where's the money? What money? Why can't anything ever be easy for me? Look, I don't have it. I just got hired to follow you and to get it back. You're lying. Come on. If I was gonna keep it, you think I'd still be here? Photographing husbands screwing their babysitters? This is what I do. Follow people and recover their stuff. Who hired you? Who? Lightman, Jake Lightman. There's no way. That, that can't be. He, he, he doesn't know I'm here. He said he followed your brother here. My brother? Yeah, he said he paid him a little visit to shake him up. No, no, no, that doesn't make... Why would he hire you? Why bother? Why not just come an get me himself? He didn't know if you'd have his money with you. He didn't want you spottin' him, getting all spooked. Oh, my God. They were, they were just here. Sam's guys. They fucking tortured me. You have to get out. Sheldon? What happened? What is it? Are you alright? None of us are. I'm calling the police. You can't. You don't think so? No, please. They'll kill you. All of you. But what are you talking about? The, the money. It traces back to you. To us? The bank drafts are in Hy's name. That's the name I used. Hy's name? How? There was something about you I liked when you came in for a loan. About years ago. Do you remember? Besides, you're the only Hy I know. The Hebrew Loan bank. I remember. As a Jew, surely you must understand how important this is for the Havurah. After all these years you remembered? I'm sorry. That's why I sent you the money. The gift. That was from you? We thought it was a donation, a gift. It was. Hy, make the call. No, you don't understand, please. The police won't be able to protect you. You'll all be killed. So you tell them. You tell them the truth. The truth is that the money's gone. I don't have it. Except for that. Please, you have to listen. We don't have to listen. The police will listen. The police aren't the ones who are missing the two million dollars. So that's it? We're finished either way. There is a way. Am I right? Yes? I think it's your only chance. He has to disappear. If I'm gone, they'll think that I have it. Now I know what a devil looks like. No horns, no tail. Only greed and fear. You're are telling the truth now because you are scared. That's not true. I could have left without coming back here, but I wanted you to know. I wanted to protect you. I want to believe you. You realize this is all that's left? Marvin, maybe we-- Go ahead. I was once a millionaire. I know how you feel. Now we'll help you. Our way. You're joking? Well, you said you had to get out of the country. But... What did you expect, business class? You are a wanted man. I thought some money. A disguise. What you mean in beard and glasses like in the movies? Get serious. This way, no passport, nothing. You're just another Jew who's final wish is to be buried in his homeland. I don't know if I like the sound of that. Take or leave it. Are these holes big enough? How much air do you need? Give him the pills, please. What pills? Sleeping pills. To relax. So you can sleep. No way. You wanna be awake? He wants to be awake. I'm sorry. I am sorry, too. Oh. Oh, God. There, done. Too bad we had to destroy the newspapers. Otherwise he would have had something to read on the trip. Newspaper. How could they? How did you find me? - It's a small town. - Police have identified the victim... - I know your face. You're sure you don't come before. And missing since late last week. Also missing is his brother Jake Lightman as well as Darrel Zimmer. They, they were just here. Sam's guys. They fucking tortured me. He was here, Darrel. These guys hacked my fingers off. What do you think they were looking for? What, what do you, you have to get out, you have to get out. You're dead if you stay, Darrel. Lousy janitors. You can't trust any of them. This is what I do. I follow people, recover their stuff. You can't trust any of them. Who hired you? Who? Who? Hey? Marvin? - Morry. - Hey, Morry, how ya doin'? How is your hand? My hand? Never felt better. So, you like the new building? Hello? Hello? Marvin? Marvin? Hey? Let me out of here. A tourist. Look at him? I went down in the valley one day I heard an angel singing I heard a voice, I saw no one I heard that angel sing One day, if you're lucky enough, you'll be confronted by the truth. You'll see your life in front of you, and you'll realize just how much you hate it. When that happened to me, I decided to do something about it. I decided to become the person I could be. Of course, once you reach for the brass ring, well, you better hold on because the rest is out of your hands. I went down in the valley one day I heard that angel singing I seen an old devil walking down my way I heard that angel sing In that great and getting up morning I heard the angels singing to me In that great and getting up morning Woo, you know I heard my angels Didn't I hear my angels Hallelujah"
19,2009,Up,American,"In 1940, nine-year-old Carl Fredricksen idolizes famous explorer Charles F. Muntz. When Muntz is accused of fabricating the skeleton of a giant exotic bird he says he discovered at Paradise Falls, he vows not to return until he captures one alive. One day, Carl befriends a girl named Ellie, also a Muntz fan. She confides to Carl her desire to move her ""clubhouse""—an abandoned house in the neighborhood—to a cliff overlooking Paradise Falls.
Carl and Ellie grow up, get married and live in the restored house. Carl sells toy balloons at the zoo where Ellie works. However, after Ellie suffers a miscarriage[7] and they are told they cannot have a child due to Ellie also being infertile, the couple remember their childhood dream of visiting Paradise Falls. They save for the trip, but repeatedly have to spend the money on more pressing needs. Finally, the now elderly Carl arranges for the trip, but Ellie falls ill and dies.
By 2009, Carl still lives in the house, stubbornly holding out while the neighborhood homes are torn down and replaced by skyscrapers. When he accidentally injures a construction worker, the court deems him a public menace, ordering him to move to a retirement home. However, Carl resolves to keep his promise to Ellie by turning his house into a makeshift airship, using thousands of helium balloons. Russell, a young ""Wilderness Explorer"" who visited Carl in his effort to earn his final merit badge, for assisting the elderly, becomes an accidental stowaway.
After surviving a thunderstorm, the flying house lands on a tepui opposite Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa, hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. Russell encounters a tall, colorful flightless bird, known as the mythical ""Snipe"", whom he names ""Kevin"". They then meet a Golden Retriever named Dug, who wears a special collar that allows him to speak and who vows to take the bird to his master. The next day, they encounter a pack of aggressive dogs led by Alpha, a Doberman Pinscher, and are taken to their master, who turns out to be Charles Muntz. Muntz invites Carl and Russell aboard his dirigible, where he explains to them that he is searching for a giant bird. When Russell notes the bird's similarity to Kevin, Muntz becomes hostile, believing they are attempting to capture the bird themselves. Carl flees with Kevin and Dug, but Muntz captures Kevin and starts a fire beneath Carl's house, forcing him to choose between saving it or Kevin. After Carl saves the house, he and Russell eventually reach the falls, though Russell is upset at Carl for abandoning Kevin. Carl looks through Ellie's childhood scrapbook and is surprised to find that she has filled in the blank pages with photos of their marriage, along with a note thanking him for the ""adventure"" and encouraging him to go have a new one.
The repentant Carl goes outside, only to see Russell sailing off with some balloons and a propulsive leaf blower to try to rescue Kevin. By throwing out his furniture and keepsakes, Carl manages to lighten the house enough to follow. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl manages to board the dirigible, tether the house, and free Russell and Kevin. Dug inadvertently saddles Alpha with the cone of shame and becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz pursues them around the airship, trapping Dug, Kevin and Russell inside Carl's house. Carl lures Kevin back onto the airship, with Dug and Russell clinging to her back. Muntz leaps after them, but snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death. The house then descends out of sight through the clouds.
After reuniting Kevin with her chicks, Carl and Russell fly the dirigible back to the city. Russell receives his Assisting the Elderly badge, and Carl presents Russell with his own badge: a grape soda cap that Ellie gave to Carl when they first met. Meanwhile, Carl's house has landed on the cliff beside Paradise Falls, fulfilling his promise to Ellie.",8.3,tt1049413,"Movie Fan News presents: Spotlight on ""Adventure"". What you are now witnessing is footage never before seen by civilized humanity, a lost world in South America, lurking in the shadow of Majestic Paradise Falls it's full of plants and animals undiscovered by science. Who would dare set foot on this inhospitable summit? Why, our subject today, Charles Muntz. The beloved explorer lands his dirigible, ""The Spirit of Adventure"", into Hampshire, this week, completing a year long expedition to the lost world. This mighty aircraft was designed by Charles Muntz himself and is longer than throw edition petty waggons placed end to end. And here comes the adventurer now. Never-apart from his faithful dogs, Muntz conceived the craft for the canine comfort. It's a veritable flouting palace in the sky complete with doggy baths and mechanical canine walker. And Jiminy Cricket! To the locals he's considered a business and hero! And how! Adventure is out there! But what has Muntz brought back this time? Gentlemen, I give you the Monster of Paradise Falls! And gully, what a swell monster this is! But what's this? Scientists cry ""Foul!"" The National Explorers Society accuses Muntz of fabricating the skeleton. No! The organization strips Muntz of his membership. Humiliated, Muntz vows to return to Paradise Falls and promises to capture the beast... alive. I promise to capture the beast alive! And I will not come back until I do! And so, the explorer's off to clear his name. Bon voyage, Charles Muntz! And good luck capturing the Monster of Paradise Falls! SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE Here's Charles Muntz, piloting his faimous dirigible. He hurdles Pikes Peak. He hurdles the Grand Canyon. He hurdles Mount Everest! He goes around Mount Everest!

Well, just to let you know, my boss will be happy to take this whole place off your hand. And would double his last offer. What do you say to that? I'll take that as a no, then.

I am not with him! This is serious! He's out to get your house! Tell your boss he can have our house. Really? When I'm dead! I'll take that as a ""maybe"". Order now: you get the camera, you get the printer, 4X optical zoom. Schneider Lens. Photo print... SD card. Good afternoon. My name is Russell and I am a wilderness explorer in tribe 54, squad lodge 12. Are you in need of any assistance today, sir? No. I could help you cross the street. No. I could help you cross your... yard? No. I could help you cross your... porch. No. Well, I gotta help you cross something. No, I'm doing fine. Good afternoon. - My name is Russell. - Kid... And I am a wilderness explorer in tribe 54. Slow down... - ... squad lodge 12. - Kid! - Are you in need of any assistance? - Thank you, but I don't need any help! Aouch. Proceed. Good afternoon. Skip to the end! See these? These are my wilderness explorer badges. You may notice one is missing. It's my ""Assisting the elderly badge"". If I get it, I'll become a senior wilderness explorer! The wilderness must be explored! It's gonna be great! There is a big ceremony and all the dads come and... we pin on our badges... - So you wanna assist an old person. - Yeah! Then I'll be a senior wilderness explorer! - Have you ever heard of a ""snipe""? - ""Snipe""? A bird. Big eyes. Every night it sneaks into my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas. I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it. - If only someone could help me... - Me, me, I'll do it! I don't know, it's awfully crafty. You'd have to clap your hands three times to lure it in. I'll find her, mr. Fredricksen! I think its burrow is two blocks down... Two blocks down. Got it! Snipe! Here, snipie, snipie... Bring it back here when you find it! Snipe! And stop. Stop. Stop! Hey, hey! Hey, you! What do you think you're doing? I am so sorry, sir. Don't touch that! No, no, no, let me take care of that for you. Get away from our mailbox! - Sir... - I don't want you to touch that! It looks bad. COURT SUMMONS Sorry, mr. Fredricksen. You don't seem like a public menace to me. Take this. The guys from ""Shady Oaks"" will be by to pick you up in the morning, ok? What do I do now, Ellie? Good morning, gentlemen. Good morning, mr. Fredricksen. You're ready to go? Ready as I'll ever be. Would you do me the favour and take this? I'll meet you in the van in just a minute. I... wanna say one last goodbye to the old place. Sure. Take all the time you need, sir. That's typical. He's probably going to the bathroom for the 80th time. You'd think he'd take better care of his house. So long, boys! I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls! SOUTH AMERICA We are on our way, Ellie. Hi, mr. Fredricksen. It's me, Russell. What are you doing out here, kid? I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch. But this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse. Please, let me in. No. Aw, all right. You can... come... in. I've never been in a floating house before. Goggles... Look at this stuff! Are you going on a trip? ""Paradise Falls, a land lost in time"". Are you going to South America, mr. Fredricksen? Don't touch that! You'll soil it. You know, most people take a plane. But you're smart, because you have your TV, clocks and stuff. Ooo, is this how you steer your house? Does it really work? This makes it turn right and that way is left. Hey, look! Buildings! That building's so close, I can almost touch it! Wow, this is great! You should try this, mr. Fredricksen. Look, there's a bus that could take me home two blocks away! Hey, I can see your house from here! Don't jerk around so much, kid! Well, that's not gonna work. I know that cloud, it's a ""cumulonimbus"". Did you know that a cumulonimbus... Aaa, I stayed up all night blowing up ballons... for what? That's nice, kid. What are you doing over there? Look! See? Cumulonimbus. My bag! Got you! Uuu, I thought you were dead. What happened? I steered us. I did it! I steered the house. You steered us? After you tied your stuff down, you took a nap. So I went ahead and steered us down here. Yeah, sure. I can't tell where we are. O, we're in South America all right. It was a singe. I used my wilderness explorer GPS. GP... what? My dad gave it to me. It shows exactly where we are on the planet. With this baby we'll never be lost! Ups. We'll get you down, find a bus stop, and you'll just tell the man you want to get back to your mother. Sure, but I don't think they have buses in Paradise Falls. There, that ought to do it. There, I'll give you some change for the bus fare. No, I'll just use my city bus pass. It's just gonna be like a billion passes to get back to my house. Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer? Well, we're up pretty high. It'll take hours to get down. I think that was a building or something. What was that, mr. Fredricksen? We can't be close to the ground yet. Wait, no, no! Wait, wait! Hang on! Pull back! Where... where are we? This doesn't look like the city or the jungle, mr. Fredricksen. Don't worry, Ellie. I've got it. There it is! Ellie, it's so beautiful! We made it! We made it! Russell, we can float right over there. Climb up, climb up! Do you mean... assist you? - Yeah, whatever. - Ok, I'll climb up! - Watch it! - Sorry. When you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up. Got it? Are you on the porch yet? What? That's it? I came all this way here to get stuck on the wrong end of this rock pile? Ah... great. Hey, if I could assist you over there... would you sign up for my badge? What are you talking about? We could walk your house to the fall. - Walk it? - Yeah. After all we weigh it down, we could walk it right over there. Like a parade balloon. Now, we'll walk to the falls quickly and quietly, with no rap music or flash dancing. We have three days at best till the helium leaks out of those balloons. And if we are not at the falls when that happens... we're not getting to the falls. There... I found sand! Don't you worry, Ellie. We'll get our house over there. It is fun already, isn't it? By the time we get there, You're gonna feel so assisted... Oh, mr. Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated, use the wilderness explorer call. Wait, why are we going to Paradise Falls, again? Hey, let's play a game. It's called: ""See who can be quiet the longest"". Cool! My mom loves that game! Darn thing... Come on, Russell, hurry it up. Ah, I'm tired. My knee hurts. Which knee? My elbow hurts and I have to go to the bathroom. I asked you about that five minutes ago. I didn't have to go then! I don't wanna walk anymore... Please, stop... Russell, if you don't hurry up, the tigers will eat you. There are no tigers in South America. Zoology. Ah, for the love of Pete... Go on into the bushes and do your business. Ok. Here! Hold my stuff! I've always wanted to try this. Mr. Fredricksen, am I suppose to dig the hole before or after? That's none of my concern. Oh, it's ""before""! Tracks? Snipe. Here, snipe. Come on out, snipe. Snipe! Got you. Don't be afraid, little snipe. I am a wilderness explorer, so I'm a friend to all of nature. Want some more? Hi, boy. Don't eat it all. Come on out. Come on. Come on... Don't be afraid, little snipe. Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice giant... snipe! I found the snipe. Oh, did you? - Are they tall? - Oh, yes. They're very tall. Do they have a lot of colors? They do, indeed. - Do they like chocolate? - Oh, yeah... Chocolate? What is that thing? It's a snipe. There no such thing as a snipe! But you said... Go on, get out of here! Go! Careful, Russell. Look, mr. Fredricksen, he likes me. - Russell! - No, stop! That tickles! Get out of here! Go on! Get! No, no, no. Kevin, it's ok. Mr. Fredricksen is nice. - Kevin? - Yes, that's the name I just gave him. Bit it, boo, scram! Hey, that's mine! Shoo, shoo! Get out of here! Go on, bit it! Can we keep him? Please? I'll get the food for him, I'll walk him, I'll change his newspapers... No. An explorer is a friend to all, be it a plant, a fish or a tiny mole. That doesn't even rhyme. Yeah, it does. - Hey, look, Kevin. - What? Hey, get down from there! You're not allowed up there! You come down here right now! Can you believe this, Ellie? Ellie? Hey, Ellie, can I keep the bird? Aha. She said for you to let me. But I told him no. I told you no. N - o! I see you, back there. Go on, get out of here! Shoo! Go annoy someone else for a while. Hey, are you ok over there? Hello? Oh, hello, sir. Thank Goodness. It's nice to know someone else is up here. I can smell you. What? You can... smell us? I can smell you. - Hey! - You were talking to a rock. Hey, that one looks like a turtle. Look at that one! That one looks like a dog! - Ah, it is a dog. - What? We're not allowed to have dogs in my appartment. Hey, I like dogs! We have your dog! - I wonder whom he belongs to. - Sit, boy. Hey, look, he's trained! Shake. Aha. Speak. Hi, there. Did that dog just say ""Hi, there""? Oh, yes! My name is Dug. I just met you and I love you. My master made me this collar. He is a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that I may talk. Squirrel! My master is good and smart. It's not possible. It is because my master is smart. Hey, cool! What do these do, boy? Would you cut... I'd use that collar... I would be happy if you stopped. Russell, don't touch that. It could be... radioactive or something. I am a great tracker. My master sent me on a special mission. All by myself. Have you seen a bird? I want to find one and I've been on a scent. I'm a great tracker. Did I mention that? Hey, that is a bird. I have never seen one up close, but this is the bird. May I take your bird up to camp as my prisoner? Yes, yes, take it. And on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog. I can bark. And here's howling. Can we keep him, please? Please, please, please? - No. - But it's a talking dog! It's just a weird trick or something. Let's get to the fall. Please, be my prisoner! Oh, please oh, please, be my prisoner! Oh, here it is! I picked up the bird's scent! Wait a minute, wait a minute. What is this? Chocolate. I smell chocolate. I'm getting prunes and ginger cream. Who are they? Oh, man, the master will not be pleased. We'd better tell him someone took the bird, right, Alfa? No. Soon enough the bird will be ours again. Find the scent, my compadres, and you, too, shall have much rewarding from the master for the toil that you did. Hey, Alfa, I think there's something wrong with your collar. You must have broken it. Yeah. Your voice sounds funny. Beta, Delta! Perhaps you desire... Squirrel! Perhaps you desire to challenge the right that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning. No, no. No. But maybe Dug would. You might wanna ask him. I wonder if he's found the bird on his ""very special mission"". Do not mention Dug to me at this time. His fool's errand will keep him most occupied... Most occupied, indeed. Do you not agree with that which I'm saying to you now? Sure. But the second the master finds out that you sent Dug out by himself, none of us will get a treat. You're unwise, my trusted lieutenant. This is Alfa. Calling Dug. Come in, Dug. Hi, Alfa. Your voice sounds funny. I know, I know! Have you seen the bird? Oh, yes. The bird is my prisoner now. Yeah, right. Impossible. Where are you? I am here with the bird and I will bring it back and then you like me. Oh, gotta go. Dug, who are you talking to? - Wait, wait! - What is Dug doing? Why is he with the small mailman? Where are they? There he is. Come on! Please, oh, please, be my prisoner. Dug, stop bothering Kevin! That man over there says I can take the bird. And I love that man there like he is my master. I am not your master! I am warning you once again, bird! - Hey, quit it! - I am jumping on you now, bird! At this rate we will never get to the falls! I am nobody's master, got it? I don't want you here and I don't want you here! I'm stuck with you! If you two don't clear out of here by the time I count to three... A ball! Oh, boy, oh, boy, a ball! Ball? You want a ball? Yes, I do! I ever so want the ball! Go get it! Oh, boy, I will get it and then bring it back! Quick, Russell, give me some chocolate. - Why? - Just give to me! Bird! Bird! Come on, Russell. Wait! Wait, mr. Fredricksen! What are you doing? Hey, we're pretty far now. Kevin's gonna miss. I think that did the trick. Hi, master. Afternoon. Well, thanks for keeping us dry, anyway, Ellie. Which one is the front? Well, boy... Is this step three or step five? There. All done. That's for you. Well, tents are hard. Wait, aren't you super wilderness guy with the GPS and the badges? Yeah, but... Can I tell you a secret? - No. - All right. Here it goes. I never actually built a tent before. There! I said it. You've been camping before, haven't you? Well, never outside... Well, why didn't you ask your dad how to build a tent? I don't think he wants to talk about this stuff. Try him sometime, maybe he'll surprise you. He's away alot, I don't see him much. He's gotta be home sometime. I call, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much. Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first name? - Phyllis isn't my mom. - Oh! But he promised he'd come to my Explorers Ceremony to pin on my ""Assisting the elderly badge"". So he can show me how about the tent then, right? Hey, why don't you get some sleep? We don't want to wake the travelling flea circus. Dle Fredricksen, Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner. We have to protect him. Can Kevin go with us? All right, he can come. Promise you won't leave him? Yeah. Cross your heart? Cross my heart. What have I got myself into, Ellie? Good morning, sweetheart. We'd better get moving. The bird's gone. Maybe Russell won't notice. All right, everybody up! Where's Kevin? He's wondered off! - Dug, find Kevin! Kevin! - Find the bird, find the bird! Point! Oh, look! There he is... Point! Hey, that's my roof! Get off my roof! Yeah, get off of his WROOF! What is he doing? The bird is calling to her babies. Her babies! Kevin is a... girl? Her house is over there, on those twisty rocks. She's been gathering food for her babies and must get back to them. Wait, Kevin is just leaving. But you promised to protect her. Her babies need her. We gotta make sure they're together. Sorry, Russell. We've lost enough time already. Yeah... It was her favorite chocolate. Because you sent her away, there's more for you. Kevin? Where's the bird? You said you had the bird! Oh, yes, oh, yes. If I had said that, I can see how you would think that. Where is it? Oh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow and then I will again have the bird. Yes. You lost it. why do I not have a surprised feeling? Well, at least you now have led us to the small mailman and to the one that smells as prunes. The master will be most pleased we have found them. He will ask them many questions. Come. Wait! We're not going with you. We're going to the fall. Get away from me! Down! You came here... in that? Yeah. In a house? A floating house? That is the darnest thing I've ever seen! You're not after my bird, are you? But if you need to borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy to oblige! Well, this is all a misunderstanding. My dogs made a mistake. Wait. Are you Charles Muntz? Well... yes. The Charles Muntz? Adventure's out there! It's really him! That's Charles Muntz! It is? Who's Charles Muntz? Him! Carl Fredricksen. My wife and I, we were your biggest fans. Oh, well, you're a man of good taste. Now you must be tired. Hungry? Atention, everyone! These people are no longer intruders. They are our guests. Yeah! All right! I like you temporarily. I will not bite you. The small mailman smells like chocolate! I'm sorry about the dogs, I hope they weren't too... rough on you. Go ahead and pull your airship right next to mine. We are not actually going inside the ""Spirit of Adventure"" itself? Oh, would you like to? Would I? Wait up, mr. Muntz! Jiminy Cricket! - Not you! - What do we do with Dug? He lost the bird. Put him in ""the cone of shame"". I do not like ""the cone of shame"". Most of the collection is housed in the world's top museums: New York, Münich, London. Of course, I kept the best for myself. Did you ever. Look at that! Oh, yes. The Arseloterium. The beast charged while I was brushing my teeth. I used my shaving kit to bring it down. Oh, yeah, now, surprise me. The only way to get it out of Ethiopia at the time was to have it declared technical weapon. Oh, my Gosh! The giant Somalian Labradodis! Oh, you recognize it? I'm impressed! There's an interesting story there. Excellent choice. I found it on safari, with Roosevelt. He and I fell into a habit of playing Gin Rummy in the evenings and did he cheat! He was horrible. Master, dinner is ready. Oh, dear, broken translator. I think it's that loose wire again. - There you go, big fellow. - Thank you, master. I liked his other voice. Well, dinner is served. Right this way. So, how are things States side? Almost tempted to go back a few times. But I have unfinished work here. Please! I hope you're hungry. Because Epsilon is the finest chef I've ever had. Epsilon, you've done it again! Yeah! Hey! Hey! My Ellie would have loved all these. You know, because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by the fall. I'm honored. And now you've made it. You sure we're not a bother? I'd hate to impose. No, no, it's a pleasure to have guests. A real treat. Treat? Where's my treat? I want my treat! Hey! I shouldn't have used that word. Having guests is a delight! More often I get thieves trying to steal what is rightfully mine. No... They called me a fraud, those... But once I bring back this creature, my name will be cleared. Beautiful, isn't it? Oh, I've spent a lifetime tracking it. Sometimes, years go by between seeings. I've tried to smoke it out of that death land where it lives. Can't go in after it. Once in, there's no way out. I lost so many dogs. Here they come tnose bandits who think the bird is theirs to take! is a very dangerous place. Hey, that looks like Kevin! - Kevin? - Yeah, that's my new giant pet bird! I trained it to follow us. Follow you? Impossible. How? She likes chocolate. - Chocolate? - Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate. She goes wild about it. But it ran off. Let's go now. You know, Carl... these people who pass through here A surveyor making a map... a botanist cataloguing plants... an old man taking his house to Paradise Falls. That's the best one yet, I can't wait to hear how it ends. Well, it's been a wonderful evening, but we'd better be going. You're not leaving. We don't want to take advantage of your hospitality. Come on, Russell. But we haven't even had dessert yet. Oh, the boy is right. You haven't had dessert. Epsilon here makes a delicious cherries jubilee. You really must stay! I insist! We have so much more to talk about! Kevin? It's near. Get them! - Hurry! - Kevin! Hurry! Dogs! Hurry! Master! Over here! Here! Go on, master! Left! Russell! Get back! Go on, master! I will stop the dogs! Stop, you, dogs! Help! Give me your hand! Hang on to Kevin! Kevin! No, no, no. Kevin... Stay down. She's hurt real bad. Can't we help her get home? All right. But we gotta hurry. - You lost them? - No, it was Dug. Yeah, he's with them. he helped them escape! Wait. Wait a minute. Dug. - See anything? - No, my pack is not following us. Boy, they are dumb! This is crazy. I finally meet my chidlhood hero and he's trying to kill us. - What a joke. - Hey, I know a joke! A squirrel walks up up to a tree and says: ""I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead"". It is funny because the squirrel gets dead. Careful, Russell. You ok, Kevin? You know what, mr. Fredricksen? The wilderness isn't quite what I expected. Yeah? How so? It's kind of... wild. I mean, it's not how they made it sound in my book. Get used to that, kid. My dad made it sound so easy. He is really good at camping, and how to make fire from rocks and stuff... He used to come to all my squad lodge meetings. And afterwards, we go get icecream that fattens. I always get chocolate and he gets butter brickle. Then we sit on this one curve, right outside and I'll count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones and whoever gets the most wins. I like that curve. It might sound boring, but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most. Look, there it is! Hold on, Russell, stand still. Look at that bird go! Wait up, you overgrown chicken! That's it! Go, Kevin! Go find your babies! Run, Kevin, run! Oh, no! Russell, dã-mi cuþitul tãu! Get away from my bird! No! No! Careful, I want it in good shape for my retirement. Let it go! Stop! Kevin! You gave away Kevin. You just... gave her away. This is none of my concern. I didn't ask for any of these! Master, it's all right. I am not your master! If you hadn't shown up, none of these would have happened. Bad dog, bad dog! Whether you assist me or not, I am going to Paradise Falls, if it kills me! Here. I don't want this anymore. Russell? - Russell! - I'm gonna help Kevin even if you won't! No, Russell, no! Russell? I was hiding under your porch because I love you. Can I stay? Can you stay?

20,2005,Walk the Line,American,"In 1968, as an audience of inmates at Folsom State Prison cheer for Johnny Cash's band, he waits backstage near a table saw, reminding him of his early life.
In 1944, Johnny, then known as J.R., is raised on a cotton farm in Dyess, Arkansas with his brother Jack, father Ray, and mother Carrie. J.R. is known for his singing of hymns, while his brother Jack trains himself to become a pastor. While Jack is sawing wood for a neighbor with a table saw, J.R. goes fishing until he is spotted and reprimanded by his father for wandering off. Both J.R. and Ray return home to see Jack dying after being severely injured by the saw in an accident. In 1950, J.R. enlists in the Air Force as Johnny Cash, and is stationed in West Germany. He purchases a guitar, and in 1952, finds solace in writing songs, one of which he develops as ""Folsom Prison Blues"".
After his discharge, Cash returns to the United States and marries his girlfriend, Vivian Liberto. The couple moves to Memphis, Tennessee, where Cash works as a door-to-door salesman to support his growing family. He walks past a recording studio, which inspires him to organize a band to play gospel music. Cash's band auditions for Sam Phillips, the owner of Sun Records. After they play ""Folsom Prison Blues"", the band receives a contract, and launch to stardom at the beginning of the rock and roll era.
The band begins touring as Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two. On tour, Johnny meets June Carter, with whom he falls in love. Cash begins spending more time with June, who divorces her first husband, Carl Smith. After his attempt to woo June fails, Cash starts abusing drugs and alcohol. After his behavior reaches a bottom during a performance with June, they separate.
Later, over Vivian's objections, Johnny persuades June to come out of semi-retirement, and tour with him. The tour is a success, but backstage, Vivian becomes critical of June's influence. After one performance in Las Vegas, Johnny and June sleep together. The next morning, she notices Johnny taking pills, and doubts her choices. At that evening's concert, Johnny, upset by June's apparent rejection, behaves erratically, and eventually passes out on stage. June disposes of Johnny's drugs, and begins to write ""Ring of Fire"", describing her feelings for him and her pain at watching him descend into addiction.
Returning to California, Cash travels to Mexico to purchase more drugs, and is arrested. Cash's marriage to Vivian implodes; the pair divorce and Cash moves to Nashville in 1966. Trying to reconcile with June, Johnny purchases a large house near a lake in Hendersonville. His parents and the extended Carter family arrive for Thanksgiving, at which time Ray dismisses his son's achievements and behavior. After the meal, June's mother encourages her daughter to help Cash. He goes into detox and wakes with June; she says they have been given a second chance. Though not married, the two begin spending most of their time with each other.
Cash discovers that most of his fan mail is from prisoners, who are impressed with his outlaw image. He proposes to Columbia Records that he will record an album live inside Folsom Prison. Despite Columbia's doubts, Cash says that he will perform, and his label can use the tapes if they wish. At the Folsom Prison concert, Cash says that he has been sympathetic to prisoners, explaining that his arrest for drug possession helped him to relate to them. With this success, Cash embarks on a tour with June and his band. On the bus, he stops to talk with June and proposes to her, but she turns him down. At the next concert, June says she will only speak with him on stage. Cash later performs ""Ring of Fire"" on stage. After the song, Cash invites June to a duet and stops in the middle, saying he cannot sing ""Jackson"" any more unless June agrees to marry him. June accepts and they share a passionate embrace on stage.",7.8,tt0358273,"M-Mr. Cash? M-Mr. Cash? Mr. Cash? J.R... J.R., turn it off and get to sleep! Change it, J.R. Turn it off. Guess which Carter that is. Anita? - That's fine. - Nope. June. That was little ten-year-old June singing for you. And what was the name of that number now? Turn it off! Do I have to come in there?! Let's get to bed. It's hot. It's going to be hotter tomorrow. Maybe Daddy will quit us early and we can go fishin'. We'll go fishin' Saturday. Daddy needs a good day from us tomorrow, J.R. I know. Jack? Mm-hmm? How come you're so good? I ain't. You pick five times more than me. Well, I'm bigger than you are. You know every story in Scripture. You know every song in Mama's hymnal. Songs are easy. They ain't for me. There's more words in the Bible than in Heavenly Highway Hymns. Look, J.R., if I'm gonna be a preacher one day... I got to know the Bible front to back. I mean, you can't help nobody if you can't tell them the right story. Said by noon it's gonna be 104. Them radio stations will say anything to get them niggers off. Ray, why don't you let J.R. Take the babies in? I told Roz we'd have a crop yesterday. What do I say when he pulls up here and we're shy? You ready to unload that piano? We're not selling Daddy's piano. And I'm not the one in Bartstown drinking every Saturday. Eh, what's up, Doc? Whoa! What, what did that rooster say when he was all blown up by the TNT and picking his feathers up outside that henhouse? ""F-Fortunately, boy, I keep my feathers numbered for just such an emergency."" I got it, I got it. Can we go soon? Mr. Coles gave me a dollar to cut the whole pile... and not half. Go on ahead, J.R. Catch a fish. The worm on a hook. Drop it in a brook. If things go right... you'll fry some fish tonight. Where you been? Where you been? Throw that pole down. Get in the car! In the car! J.R. You hear them, J.R.? You hear them angels? I can hear 'em, Jack. They're so beautiful. Beautiful. Jack? Do something! Do something! You know what that is, J.R.? You know that is coming out of there? Stop it, Ray. Nothing! Nothing, that's what that is. That's what that's worth. And that's what you are. Leave it alone, Ray. He didn't do this. The devil did this! He took the wrong son! - Stop it, Ray. He was my best, and now he's gone! Jack, please, don't leave me alone. - Ray! - Quiet! Quiet! Everybody quiet! You're going to miss your bus. Communist troops have been driven out of Seoul, Korea... by U.S. Forces led by General Douglas MacArthur. What's that? Anybody seen Tommy? He's leaving, Ray. Come on. Don't start crying, Mama. Be careful with that rifle, J.R. Yeah, I will, Mama. Last month, that Pervis boy got confused and shot himself. Ain't going to be no battles, Carrie. He's going to Germany. The war is in Korea. I love you. I love you, too. Take this. Thanks, Mama. Take care of yourself, Donzil. Take care of my sister, too. I will. Hey, Tommy, be a good boy. You're gonna miss your bus. Yeah. I saw this church in Dusseldorf... made of limestone, big as a train station. We could get married there and go to Venice. That's in Italy, Viv. The streets are made of water, I ain't kiddin'. Johnny, I haven't seen you for two years. We only dated for a month. My daddy says there's something wrong with you. Well... what do you say, Viv? I mean... I thought you said you loved me. I do. Oh, I do. Then don't be scared. You tell him that. You tell him I love you, too. He says that's impossible. He says that you hardly know me. Well, I know perfect when I meet it. Let's go, Cash! Viv, listen, baby... you tell your daddy I'm your man. Tell him we're gonna make a family and I'm gonna be on the radio, 'cause I am. You tell him we're gonna have a nice house and we're gonna be happy. And we're gonna live in Memphis. And you tell him I'm gonna love you forever. - Do you promise? - That's a promise, Viv. Do you hear me? That's a pro... Five minutes was up five minutes ago. I am Folsom Prison. At one time they called me ""Bloody Folsom."" And I earned the name. My own prisoners built me. Every block of my granite is cemented by the blood of many men. Is it any wonder a man sometimes went berserk and fought the hated walls that shut him in? Knock it off! You knock it off and get to sleep! This was a common thing in those old days. I had so little work for them to do... You gonna try today, John? Really try to sell something? What does that mean? I cleaned out your case last night, and, baby, all I found were peanut bags and music magazines. I need you to think about what my daddy offered. Viv, I'm trying. I mean, I'm really trying to sell stuff. Hello, ma'am. I'm from Home Equipment Company over on Summer, and we have a lot of... ...enamel colors that you can choose from that we can... Hello. I'm John Cash and I'm from the Home Equipment Company on Summer. LaQuisha! LaQuisha, who is it!? You are late, man. Little higher. A little... yeah, a little higher. Now play the chord. Let's hear your E, Marshal. There's my E. Lulubelle, time to come in! Jack! Jack, get in here! - Let's go. - Jack! Let's go, John. Viv? - Viv, open the door. Viv. Viv, don't embarrass me. You know who's out there watching. I want to see my daddy. I want to go home, John. Please. He's just got a job, sitting in there in San Anton... just waiting for us. It's just sitting there... it's just sitting there waiting... Viv, the guys are here. My band is here in Memphis. Your band? John, your band? Your band is two mechanics who can't hardly play. Baby, can't you hear the difference between you and that? You have your wife and your baby in a dump, John... and another one on the way... and we can't even make rent, John. Excuse me, sir. Are you the owner of this place? That's me. Hello, I'm J.R. Cash. Sam Phillips. Well, good to meet you, Mr. Phillips. I'm a singer and I've got a band... and we've been working on some songs. You want to cut a record, son? It's four dollars. What about the guys there on the wall in the pictures? I mean, they pay four dollars? They're on my label. How do I get on there? You audition. Right now? Call my secretary, Marion, when she comes back. She's at the salon. She'll set you up an appointment next month. I can't wait that long, Mr. Phillips. Excuse me? I can't wait that long. What about this one? I can iron it. John, you can't wear that one. It's black. It's the only color shirt we all have. Nothing wrong with black. It looks like you're going to a funeral. Maybe I am. Maybe I am. Hold on. Hold on. I hate to interrupt... but do you guys got something else? I'm sorry. I can't market gospel. No more. So that's it? I don't record material that doesn't sell, Mr. Cash... and gospel like that doesn't sell. Was it the gospel or the way I sing it? Both. Well, what's wrong with the way I sing it? I don't believe you. You saying I don't believe in God? J.R., come on, let's go. No. I want to understand. I mean, we come down here, we play for a minute... and he tells me I don't believe in God. You know exactly what I'm telling you. We've already heard that song a hundred times... just like that, just like how you sang it. Well, you didn't let us bring it home. Bring... bring it home? All right, let's bring it home. If you was hit by a truck and you were lying out in that gutter dying... and you had time to sing one song, huh, one song... people would remember before you're dirt... one song that would let God know what you felt about your time here on earth... one song that would sum you up... you telling me that's the song you'd sing? That same Jimmie Davis tune we hear on the radio all day? About your peace within and how it's real and how you're gonna shout it? Or would you sing something different? Something real, something you felt? Because I'm telling you right now... that's the kind of song people want to hear. That's the kind of song that truly saves people. It ain't got nothing to do with believing in God, Mr. Cash. It has to do with believing in yourself. Well, I've got a couple songs I wrote in the Air Force. You got anything against the Air Force? No. I do. J.R., whatever you're about to play... we ain't never heard it. Where you been? Are you drunk? What happened? He didn't like our gospel. So I played him some songs that I wrote. We made a record, Viv. I mean, a real, real record. We did it like, like six times. I had to sing the song over and over again. And, uh, and playin' it. And you should have seen Marshall. He was so nervous. But I mean, we made a real record - of my song. - Oh, baby. - Of my song. - Oh, baby. Never seen nobody play like that. Ladies and gentlemen... The Killer Jerry Lee Lewis! Get yourselves a pine box, boys... nobody follows The Killer. These next boys have just put out their first record called ""Cry, Cry, Cry"" - and it is selling like hotcakes. - Shoot, now I'm late. Oh, my gosh! Excuse me. That's my cue. Oh, no, you... oh, that's stuck... right on my dress. Hey, Bill! - Let me get... - Hold on, Bill... I'm comin'! - Uh... Oh, my. I think I hear June Carter's voice, ladies and gentlemen. I'll be right there, Bill, I'll be right there. - Uh, reckon when, June? Well, Bill, I got tangled. - Yeah, in what, June Bug? Johnny Cash's guitar strap. Don't worry, I can keep this funny for at least two minutes. And I tell you what, Bill. He's a strapping boy, that Johnny Cash. And his guitar strap is pretty strappin', too. Here. I love that Cry song by the way. Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss June Carter. - Bill! Bill, I had to come and tell you. I had to tell you... I had to tell you I just can't sing tonight. You best be getting out here. Well, Bill... I got the laryngitis. - June, we... - I do! Y'all laughing, but I do. We all just heard you hollering up a storm backstage. Well, I didn't have it then, Bill. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss June Carter. All right. June's going to be back to sing later. Her family is also with us tonight. But like I was saying, these boys up next are hotter than a pistol. They are burning up the radio with their new hit, ""Cry, Cry, Cry."" We want to make sure we give them a big Texarkana welcome. So here they are, folks. New passengers on the Sun Rocking Railway- Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two. Hello. I'm Johnny Cash. Thank you, thank you very much. Viv, I'm telling you... I think this is the best show we've ever done. Hell, it might be the best show I've ever seen. No kidding! Where are you? Texarkana. Baby, I miss you. Hey, do you hear Orbison doing our song? He turned it into a two-step, listen. You hear that? Oh, damn it! - What's the matter? Damn it! Oh, it's Roseanne. She just ran her head into the table. Roseanne! Roseanne, here, talk to Daddy. Hey, Roseanne. Hey, it's Daddy. Honey, don't, don't cry. Daddy's going to be home real soon. - John, I have to go. - Huh? I have to go, John. Bye. You're sounding good tonight, Cash. Real tight. Oh, thanks, man. You want some chili fries? Oh, no, that's all right. She's been in the spotlight since you and me was bitin' ankles. They say Maybelle had a crib at the Ryman... so she could pull her out and let her whoop and holler and pop her back in to go to sleep. We're leaving in an hour, John. All right. Aw, that's a sweet story, honey. No. Within, like, five minutes. All right. Everything else all right? Okay. I love you, too. Bye-bye. How you doing? Bye. Coffee? Yeah, and some toast, please. Hey. - Hey, how are you? - Good. Do you mind? No, not at all. Did you lose your voice? I did. I was just singing my heart out up there. I've got to ask you how you came up with that sound. What sound? That sound everybody's talking about. Steady like a train, sharp like a razor. Well, we'd play faster if we could. I guess it just... come out like that. I got to close my register. Oh, yeah, sure. Thank you. Here's a picture of my wife, Viv... - my baby, Roseanne. - Oh, look at her. She's beautiful. Thanks. Got another one on the way. - I got a little girl, too. - Yeah? Her name's Carlene, yeah. She's about the same age. You know when I was in the service... I used to look at pictures of you... you know, in magazines. Oh. No... no, it wasn't like that. I mean, I... I liked your music, you know? - Yeah? - Yeah. I mean, I... you were, well, you are... I mean, l-I kept track of you. You and your family. I listened to your voice my whole life, you know? Me and my brother, Jack... we always listened to your songs. Like ""Swallerin' Place."" - Yeah. - Yeah. We liked it when you'd sing one alone. Well, you and Jack are the only ones. What do you mean? I'm not really much of a singer, Johnny. I mean, I got a lot of personality, I got sass... I give it my all, but my sister Anita's really the one who's got the pipes. Well, who said that? Everybody. My mama, my daddy. That's how come I learned to be funny... so I'd have something to offer. Well... parents aren't always the best judge of things... if you want my opinion. So how long you on the tour? Another couple of weeks. We just got on board, but... I tell you it feels like a lot longer. I'm sure. I'm headed off, I'm going to the Ryman. Why don't you tell your brother, Jack, to tune in... and I'll sing him something. What does he like? Oh, that's-that's sweet, but, uh, he passed. I'm sorry. Were y'all real close? Yeah. Yeah, he's, uh... It's funny, I ain't talked about Jack in a long time, you know? After he died, I... I talked about him all the time... but, uh... I guess people grew tired of it. So I just stopped. John? You're tired, aren't you? Yeah. It'll slow down. It will. I better get going. It's good to talk to you. You, too. Take care. I'll see you soon. You better tune in... I'm going to sing you that ""Swallerin' Place."" I will, I really will. Okay. That's fine, that's perfect. Yes, ma'am. When was the last time you heard him moving around in there? I don't know. Thought you were going to help me today, John. You head out tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. Better start living life here with us when you come home... before you have to leave again. Hey, you know, I was thinking. You know, maybe I could get Bob to push my dates. I'm happy when I'm here. I like waking up and seeing your face. John, those bags over there? Hmm. Those letters in there are ten to one from girls. Ten to one, and they're obscene. Reba's been trying to answer some of them... but, you know, half of them ain't even 15... and they are sending pictures of themselves in bathing suits. Pictures for you to look at while you're doing time at Folsom. Oh, Viv. This one girl, she sent you... Viv, you know, don't even read those letters, you know... It's just crazy right now, that's all. You know? Hell, you should have seen last week. We was at the fair, and, uh... this bus full of 4H girls pulls up, you know... and they come piling out of there... and they go running and screaming after Carl and Roy, I mean running. John... I have a casserole in the oven and your sister in the kitchen, and I don't want to talk about the tour. Viv, you're the one who brought it up. In fact, that's my new rule. When you come home, I want to get right down to talking about regular things. Viv, don't give me no rules. All I got are rules. All I got is to be at this place at this time. I'm trying to go there, and I'm trying to be back here and spend time with you and the kids... and write songs, do this- I mean, what do you want from me, all right? I got you your dream house, all of your things... all the pretty little things. I got you your car. What do you want from me?! I want you, John, I want you! And I want everything that you promised to me. Well, what if I can't do that? Got your mind on something? What are you doing up there, man? I'm building a bomb. Where we going again? Tyler. The George Jones show. Where was it we just was? Have another one, Carl. Austin, Carl. That's where y'all picked me up. Hey, Johnny, you see the new charts? ""Cry, Cry, Cry"" was 14, I think. Yeah, I heard that. I haven't seen it. Wherever we been, I can tell you where we're going. Everybody in this car is going to hell. What about the car up there? We're all going to hell for the songs we sing. People that listen to them, they're going to hell, too. Shut up with that. God gave us a great big apple, see, and He said... ""Don't touch it."" He didn't say touch it once in a while. He didn't say take a nibble when you're hungry. He said, ""Don't touch it. Don't think about touching it. Don't sing about touching it. Don't think about singing about touching it."" Well, what about me, Jerry Lee? Am I going to hell? No, June, you're beautiful. Sleepy is what I am. She's making me fall in love with her. Feel my heart. Come here. Sincerely. Feel my heart, baby. It's just a-beating for you. Stop it, Jerry. Come on, I'm falling for you, June. Hey. Jerry Lee. Jerry Lee, stop it. Jerry Lee, just sit your ass down. Just sit down. The Chevrolet... - Looks like we're here. Oh, thank goodness. Get me out of this car and all these boys. Let's go, home sweet home, boys. If you could just put those right there, that'd be great. Oh, wait. I wanted to give you that Billboard. Oh, right. It's in here somewhere. You got a library in there, June. Here it is. I circled it for you. - Hmm. - It's right there. Yeah. Fourteen. - I don't believe it. Um, I wanted to give you this. Yeah, I just finished it. It's really amazing. The Prophet? Yeah. Keep it. Oh, no, you don't want to... Whenever I finish a book, I give it away to somebody. Just lightens my load. John. I just went through a terrible divorce. I got a world of judgment on me right now. And, um... it's really none of my business... but you seem like you have a nice family. I'm sorry. It just happened. Just happened? Yeah. You wear black 'cause you can't find anything else to wear? You found your sound 'cause you can't play no better? You just tried to kiss me, because... it just happened? You should try taking credit for something every once in a while. John. Hey, Lou. Hey, John. You okay? I'll let you know in a few minutes. How you doing? Okay. That boy Elvis sure likes to talk poon. That's all I heard since Lubbock. Ease off, ease off. Do you want some? What is it? Well, it'll just make you want to drive all the way to Jacksonville and enjoy yourself once you get there. Elvis takes 'em. Yeah. Yes, sir... Be careful. Here comes Marshall with his bomb. Hey, you got your lighter, J.R.? Yeah. All right, you help me get up in there. - Grab that fuse. - All right. How long we got us after we light it? About seconds a foot. All right. Does your wife know how much you like to blow stuff up? Sure she does. That's why I married her, John. Did you light it? There's a bomb up here, ladies and gentlemen. It'll go... Way to go, Johnny boy. Thank you. Thank you very much. How about them boys, huh? Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Three. You kicked it good tonight, John. Thanks, man. That's right, kiss his ass. Hey, Jerry Lee, your mama know you're out? She knows. She knows. How about that Johnny Cash, everybody? - Johnny Cash! Okay, now. Mr. Cash? Yeah? There's a Miss Audrey Parks here to see you. Who? Audrey Parks. Well, hey. Oh, get it now.! Ray, why don't you say grace? Mama, it's J.R.'s table. Why don't you say grace, J.R.? No, go ahead. Mm-hmm. Yeah.! Hi. Hi. You're June Carter, ain't ya? Oh, my. Betsy Pervis. Hi, Betsy. So nice to meet you. Well, we're coming to see the show tonight. Oh, wonderful. This is my husband, Lloyd. Hi, Lloyd. So nice to meet you. Y'all wouldn't know where the fishin' tackle is, would you? Back of... back of them footballs on the corner. Oh. All right, great. Well, y'all enjoy the show, and if you have any requests... just holler 'em out. - Morning. - Hey. Oh, can I help you? Oh, um, I'm looking for some lace. Oh, the sewing store on Saticoy's got lace. Thank you. You know, your ma and pa are good Christians in a world gone to pot. Well, I'll tell 'em you said that. I'm surprised they still speak to you after that stunt with Carl Smith. Divorce is an abomination. Marriage is for life. I'm sorry I let you down, ma'am. Hey. Hey. What's funny? Well, you've just been standing in that same spot for about ten minutes staring at that Polly Pepper book. Well... well, I can't... I can't figure out which one Roseanne would like more. She got brown hair, which makes me think this one. - Right. - But this is baby sister's... and she got a baby sister, and... Well, I got that one for Carlene, and she liked it. Oh, yeah? I missed her birthday. - Oh. - So I wanted to get her something more... you know, like one of these dollhouses. But I don't know how to get it out to her. You want me to help you? I think there's a lake right up around the corner. - Got a hitch in your giddy-up? - Yeah. Forgot how much I like this. Hey, June? I never used one of these fancy reels before. Well, what'd you use, a sapling? - Yeah. Okay, hold on, I'll help you. - It's like there's some kind of a lock on it or... - No. My daddy taught me how to do this; I'll show you. Keep your thumb down on the button. That loosens the line. And then you're gonna bring it back... and then you're gonna throw it out there... and then when you're ready... if you got a good spot for it, you let go of the button. - All right? - Side-arm? Yeah, side-arm. All right. See? There you go. Hey, folks, what do you say we get June Carter out here again? Maybe she'll, uh, sing with me. - No, no, no, no. Now, come on, June, I never sing with you. I have my slippers on. I'm not coming out there. Well, they don't care if you got your slippers on. Come on, it's for the sake of the evening. Folks, let's hear it: June, June... June, June, June, June... - June, June, June, June... - Come on, June. Prove Elvis wrong. He says you can't do nothing that ain't written in your calendar. - June, June, June, June, June, June... June, June, June... June, June, June, June, June, June, June, June... - You see, June? - They want to see us together. - All right, well... quit that clutching on me, and I'll sing with you... but you got to quit clutching on me. Hi, folks. How y'all doing again? I hope y'all don't mind my bare feet. So, what are we gonna sing, Johnny? You got me out here. Is that where your plan ends? - Well, uh... I always liked that song of yours, ""Time's a Wastin'."" - Let's do that one. Oh, come on, I don't know about that. How about your hit song, ""Big River""? - That's a good song. Well, ""Big River"" ain't a duet. Uh, let's do ""Time's a Wastin""'. John, I am not gonna sing that song. It's inappropriate. I recorded it with my ex-husband. - I'm not going to sing it. There's no better way to put it behind you. I'm not gonna do it. June, let's sing. Don't do that! Hey, June. June? Open up. June, open the door. Just leave me be, John, all right? What? W-What did I do? June, it's a song. Just please get away from me. I think I hear Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Three. They'll be playing all weekend long at the Malco. Matinees and evening shows, along with Jerry Lee Lewis... June Carter and Carl Perkins. It's the candy man. Is the candy man like Jerry Lee, there? How come you don't never try this brand of picking, Luther? What you're looking for, Waylon, I already found. Well, hey, June. Hey, Jerry Lee. How you doin', John? Uh... Well, okay, June. How you doing? I surmise you've never been to bed. Surmise... We've got a show at 2:00, a matinee. - You remember that? We were just practicing. Oh, come on, June, sit down. It's slick here. Not today, Jerry Lee. Why not? 'Cause you're drunk. Uh-oh! - Whoo! Come on, Junie, just come have a beer with us. I'm going home tonight after the show. I'm not here to look after y'all. You're not? You got somebody to do that for you, John. You got a wife somewhere, you remember that? Ooh! What if I didn't? There's too many ""ifs"" in that sentence. Only one, actually. There's only one ""if"" in that sentence, June. L-I thought it was a good point. There is only one. Really? How dare you talk to me like that! We surrender! We surrender! What was I thinking? I must have been crazy. Y'all are gonna blow this tour. You can't walk no line. June, we ain't blowing the tour. I am not gonna be that little Dutch boy with my finger in the dam no more! You're lying to yourself if you think this is about a tour, honey. This isn't about a tour! This isn't about a song! John. Honey, let's take a picture of Roseanne. C'mon, say cheese! What do you think of California, Mr. Cash? We like it. We just bought a house. Lunch time! Come on in, everybody. What is this? I've been looking for that. That's the letter I wrote to Bob Dylan on a plane. Hey, Mama, that's that folk singer I was telling you about. You wrote it on an air sickness bag, honey. So what? What's so funny? I was thinking maybe you ought to try sleeping at night. Maybe eating, maybe both. Hey, uh, Viv, have you made your mind up about tonight? You coming? Okay- 'cause you're asking so nice. I got it. - Hello? - Music awards. We got a British Invasion... a beautiful girl from Brazil, a matchmaker from New York. We even had a flying nanny. In 1964... Hey, Johnny. Hey, Randy, how are you? June? Hey. Hi, John. Been a long time. Yeah. Hi, Vivian, how are you? Hello, June. I saw you got married. Uh, yes, I did. Congratulations, June. - Thank you, I appreciate that. - You're welcome. So you think this one will stick? John! What is this, your second or your third? - John! - I'm just asking a question. Do not do this to me. John! Oh! Hey! June, wait up. I need to talk to you. I don't want to talk to you, John. Hey, excuse me, fella, do you mind? You don't look good, John. Well, you look real nice. So where's your truck driver? Stock car driver. And you'll be happy to know that things aren't really working out between us. It doesn't make me happy. Well, a little it does. I want to tour with you again, June. I miss the tour. I mi... I miss the music. I got two grown girls, John. I can't tour. So you're just going to do a comedy act the rest of your life? You've got a voice, June, use it. One week a month, that's all, all right? You'll work for me. You don't have to worry about bookings or agents, or publicists or anything. All right, one of your girls gets sick... you stay home, and I pay you, anyways. You stay home, and I pay you, anyways. Thank you. That's my mama's favorite song. So y'all sit down, squat down, or lie down... but make yourselves at home. 'Cause here's the one and only... Mr. Johnny Cash! 01:12:-2,314 Hello, I'm Johnny Cash. 01:14:-2,-66 01:14:-1,-77 Thank you. 01:14:-1,035 Good to see y'all. It's all June. It's all June. Thank you. Hi, good to see you. Thanks for coming. What's next? Vegas, we're booked in Vegas. Hey, June? Yeah? I want you to meet my parents. Oh! This is my mama and my daddy. Hi! How you doing? It's so nice to meet you, finally. Hi, I'm June Carter. Miss Carter. Nice to meet you. And you haven't met my little girls, have you? This is Roseanne and... - Oh, they're asleep... Ain't they sweet? Oh, you girls are all dressed alike. I love those yellow ribbons. June? Yeah? Stay clear of my children. Vivian, I... I was just saying hello. You heard me. Viv. - Vivian, please. - No. Oh, wait, catch it. Come on, y'all. I got these cookies... you're going to love 'em, man. Highfalutin' high rollers out there. 01:16:-1,389 Say, Officer... how do you get your shirts to stay that way? So stiff? Just starch. Huh. It's real nice. What? What? Are you out of your rabid-ass mind? All right, boys, good night. Good night, y'all. - God night. - Let me take one. I am so sleepy... That was a fun show tonight. Yeah, it was. - This is my room. - Yeah. Hey, you want to have one of these with me? Uh... I don't know. Can I have one? John! John, that's mean! All right. Wait, wait, wait, here. I'll get a good one. - You are... You know what? You're just mean. That's what you are. You're mean! Here, here. You're a mean man. - Don't say that. - And I knew it. 01:18:-7,-98 01:18:-5,-107 I've known it all along. 01:18:-5,004 01:18:-4,198 Wait a minute. 01:18:-4,305 01:18:-3,272 Here. No. I don't trust you. Don't say that. I don't, I don't trust you. Yes, you do. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. You are so evil! - Terrible! Oh... I best better answer it. Hello? Oh, hey, Carlene, what's wrong? Okay, sweetie... I can't understand what you're saying... you're crying so hard. I know, but you got to calm down, honey. 01:19:-4,666 01:19:-3,655 All right. 01:19:-3,767 But everything's okay? Yeah, I know, sweetie... sometimes that happens. - Sweetie, little sisters do stuff like that, sometimes. You got to learn to be patient with her. Um... okay, well, um... tell Linda that Mommy said it's all right for you to have pancakes on Saturdays. - Hey, June... I'm gonna go to my room. - All right? Yeah, I know, sweetie. I'm going to come home soon. Yeah, so please don't cry. Front desk. Hi, could I have June Carter's room, please? Certainly. One moment, sir. June? It's not wrong, June. This ain't wrong. June! I'm not gonna do this, John. I'm not gonna do this. Thank you so much. - Thank you. Thank you so much. Where's Johnny?! Well, Johnny Cash will be out in just a minute. He's been detained for just a minute. But we're gonna keep you entertained till then. And we're gonna play, uh... a wonderful song... 01:21:-7,215 01:21:-5,649 Wait, hold on, hold on. Johnny's here. 01:21:-2,220 01:21:-1,244 Here he is! 01:21:-1,355 Mr. Johnny Cash! Hi, folks, I'm Johnny Cash. What about that June Carter? Ain't she a sweetheart. How ya'll doing? Get it on, man! Play the fucking thing! I'm okay. Oh, my God, John? Close the curtain. - Get a doctor! - John! John! Pull the curtain back! Come on, pull it back! - Pull it back. - Are you okay? 01:23:-8,735 01:23:-5,-35 - Here, here, look at me. - John? John? 01:23:-5,070 01:23:-2,164 Look at me. 01:23:-2,274 Fortunately, I was keeping my feathers numbered for just such an emergency. - Let's get some help! Well, get him some help! The tour's been canceled. Who says? We got your ticket home, John, tomorrow. See where I'm putting it? Right here by the phone. Take care of yourself, John. 01:24:-3,700 You're burning up. Got hotter places than my forehead. Tell me you don't love me. I don't love you. You're a liar. Well, then I guess you ain't got no problems, do you? Where's my pills? Flushed them all. June. Junie, don't say that. Hold on, all right? L-I need those. I need those pills! Listen, that's just... baby, it's just... Th-Those are my prescriptions, from the doctor, okay? L-I nee... I need those. It burns. It burns, it burns. Mommy! Mommy! 01:26:-6,350 01:26:-4,284 Few more minutes, pal. There you go. Mr. Cash. You want to take these strings off or you want us to break it? Your mama was here... your daddy, too. What'd he say? He said now you won't have to work so hard to make people think you've been to jail. 01:29:-4,131 01:29:-3,325 Hey, Daddy. 01:29:-3,432 01:29:-1,297 Hey, baby. 01:29:-1,401 You okay? Yeah, I'm fine... I'll see you in the morning. Cindy doesn't like mustard. The pills were legal, Viv. You know, I got prescriptions, it's just... You're not supposed to buy them across the border, that's all. Other than that, it's... fine. 01:30:-7,655 01:30:-5,088 So the radio's lying? 01:30:-5,190 01:30:-4,350 Yeah. 01:30:-4,458 01:30:-2,-177 The TV's lying? 01:30:-2,-74 01:30:-1,-107 Baby, they'll say anything to... 01:30:-1,-06 Your lawyer's lying? Luther's lying, Marsh is lying, your manager... Viv, I don't want to fight. What about June? Does she think it's fine her new boy's a drug addict? She left the tour, Viv, in Vegas. Well, that explains everything, doesn't it? John! 01:31:-5,050 01:31:-3,-153 John, what are you doing? 01:31:-3,048 01:31:-1,548 It's 7:00 a.m. The kids are getting ready for school. I was hanging pictures. John, please don't hang these. Viv, they're pictures of my band. Don't hang these. No, I don't want you to hang these. Viv, let go - of the damn picture. - No. - No, I said, please don't hang these, John. - Viv! No! Viv, get back here! Viv? Viv, get back here. Viv, I ain't kidding! Vivian, give me the damn picture. 01:32:-8,741 01:32:-7,765 Viv. 01:32:-6,-125 01:32:-5,433 Give me the... 01:32:-5,544 01:32:-2,138 No! 01:32:-2,246 Viv. Wai... Don't... - You! You! - Now, stop it. Baby, stop it! - You pathetic excuse for a man! - All right, ba... She will find out, you liar... She'll find out! She'll find out, John! You liar! - Stop it! - No! You think you're perfect?! You think you're perfect? Huh?! - Huh?! No! No. No. No! 01:33:-8,134 01:33:-7,761 Shut the door. Hey, you leaving all this? Viv? You leaving all this? Girls! Girls! No! - Girls! - Hey, did June call? Waylon! Did June call? Woman won't return my damn calls. They disconnected it yesterday. Insufficient fundulation. Now, come on, man, I gave you money for that. Well, that was last month. This is this month. You see, I'm... I'm a little behind right now, and-and I need this to turn my phone back on... because I need to talk to my woman. See, I'm-I'm in love with a woman... and I need to talk to her, you understand? I need this to get my car out of the shop. 01:35:-7,121 01:35:-4,-46 She lives way, way out on the edge of town. 01:35:-4,057 01:35:-2,423 It's the Bataan death march to get there. 01:35:-2,527 You see? So, if you just go ahead and-and-and cash this. Um, I'm sorry, Mr. Cash. - You know who I am? - I... - Yes, sir. - Okay. Then just please cash the check for me. The bank puts an automatic hold on checks like this. It's a large amount. Well, if you can't cash it... - then it's just a piece of paper. See? - Oh, don't do that. - Please, don't. - Why, you can't cash it, it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing. Just a damn piece of paper. Mama, Johnny Cash is here! Hey, girls. Hey, Carlene, you look real look nice. Hey, Johnny. Mama, Johnny Cash is here! Hi, Mother Maybelle. 01:36:-8,681 01:36:-5,047 Hey, John. 01:36:-5,150 01:36:-4,583 How are you doing? 01:36:-4,685 01:36:-1,745 I'm doing all right. Hi, June. Hi, John. Hey, girls... can you go inside the living room and clean up that mess? All right, honey. I tried to call, June, but I think there's something wrong with your phone. Look at you. Have you looked in a mirror lately? How are you gonna sing, when you can't even talk? I got the laryngitis. Remember? Marry me, June. Oh, please. Get up off your knees. You look pathetic. Come on. I don't want my girls seeing somebody like this. Come on, baby. Where's my friend John? What, did he get high? Or is he incognito? Is he gone? 'Cause I don't like this guy, Cash. I ain't incognito. I'm right here. You see? I'm here. Fine, where's your car? 01:37:-8,-227 01:37:-7,138 Kiss and make up. 01:37:-7,241 01:37:-5,072 You walked here? 01:37:-5,176 01:37:-4,541 Yeah. 01:37:-4,645 01:37:-1,-23 You walked here all the way from Nashville? 01:37:-1,080 Yeah, walking's good for you. See, I'm trying to get into shape, June. It cleans out your system. Well, it's a spiritual thing. I'm on a love walk. The June Carter Love Walk. - And memorial. - You know what? I'm supporting more than myself right now. Please, do not blow another tour. Aw, June, love's more important than a tour. - Is that right? - Yes, it is. Well, then start loving yourself... so we can go back to work. All right, June. Hey, you keep your phone on, and I will, too. I'll call. I'll call you. When you're feeling better, I'll call. Hey, that's a beautiful house! Hey, man. Beautiful place, man. - Yeah? Thanks. - Uh-huh. Hello. June? Hey, it's John. Hey. Hey. How you doing? I'm fine, John, how are you? 01:40:-7,621 01:40:-3,-114 Uh, yeah, doing a lot better than the last time you saw me. 01:40:-3,-09 01:40:-2,049 Well, that's good. 01:40:-2,159 01:40:-1,683 I'm glad to hear that. No, that was... no, that was a rough patch, uh, June. I just needed to, uh, you know, get some time. I'm doing better, though, now, you know? I, uh, got out of that apartment and got this place out in Hendersonville on a lake. Big spread. I heard that. Yeah, I'm... trying to get things together. Mm-hmm. Are you alone on Thanksgiving, John? Yeah. My folks are coming down with Reba and Roseanne... and, uh, I got this big bird... but I don't know when to put it in the oven or really what temperature to set it at or... Uh-huh. It is beautiful. Really lucky. I'm really proud of you. - You see, it goes from right up there... - Mm-hmm. Clear across halfway around the lake. 01:41:-8,513 01:41:-7,639 Yeah. 01:41:-7,748 01:41:-5,682 What's going on down there with that tractor? 01:41:-2,-215 Uh, I got it stuck. I was trying to pull out that stump, and I couldn't... - Doing something dangerous. - Yeah, but... That's a fine piece of equipment to leave sinking in that mud. Is that the way you take care of your things? Well... Hey. - Hey! - There's John. - Happy Thanksgiving. - Oh! Here, Carlene. - Happy Thanksgiving! - Hello, John. - Hi. - I like this place out here. Oh, thanks. - Happy Thanksgiving. - Hey, Rosie. Thank you. - Hey. - Let's go over and meet John's... House is beautiful. Thanks. Thanks for coming. Hey, how you folks doing? - John, how are you doing? - Let me help you out. - All right. - Oh, thank you, Carrie. Mother Maybelle, that's my mama, Carrie. Maybelle Carter, happy to meet you. This is my daddy... - Ray. - Ray, how you doing? - How are you doing? - Good to meet you. - My mama, Carrie. - How are you doing? Carrie was going to cook for y'all, but, uh... J.R., he doesn't have a pot or a pan, so... 01:42:-6,642 01:42:-4,405 Well, we're more than happy to share our food with you folks. 01:42:-4,511 01:42:-3,569 I just moved in, you know? 01:42:-3,679 01:42:-1,-59 - Okay, thanks, Carrie. - Come on inside. 01:42:-1,047 If you're gonna get out on some big water like the lakes or river, you're gonna need something that you can cast out there a pretty good ways. Now if you haven't gotten one yet, what I want to tell you is... you need to get you a Zebco 33. That's about the best reel that you can get. They don't tangle up very much, and you can cast 'em about as far as you want to throw 'em. Of course, around the house there, them little farm ponds... you don't need nothing but a cane pole and a float... and maybe some crickets or worms, if you can dig them up. That's all we ever had. Zebco is probably your best bet. I bought June one when she was about years old. You remember that? - That's right, I caught a lot of fish with that. - Mm-hmm. You sure did. So wha... what do you think, Daddy? About what? About the house. It's a fine, big house, John. 01:43:-6,369 01:43:-5,563 It's not as big 01:43:-5,670 01:43:-3,001 as Jack Benny's. 01:43:-3,105 You been to Jack Benny's, Ray? Saw it on the TV. Carrie, I was meaning to ask you... did you teach the boys to play? Well, J.R. Always sang pretty... but I don't think I could take credit for it. I bet you did. I bet you learned the same way I did. - Oh, out of the hymnals, sure. - Hymnals. I knew you'd say that. But you know, you'd be surprised how many musicians can't read shaped notes nowadays. I can't imagine. I know, I know, but my husband's uncle... E.M. Bays, he taught me with hymnals, too. How about you, John? You know how to read shaped notes? John? Mama asked you a question, John. I'm really glad y'all could be here today... especially you, Daddy. I'm glad you came. To dinner, and Thanksgiving and all. 01:44:-6,429 01:44:-3,455 Not everybody's here. Jack's not here, is he? Huh? ""Where you been?"" That's what you said to me. Remember? And I was years old. You's got Jack's bloody clothes... And you said to me, ""Where you been?"" Well? Where were you? Where were you? I quit drinking a long time ago, J.R. 01:45:-8,-147 01:45:-8,751 What about you? 01:45:-7,-146 01:45:-5,414 You still taking them pills? 01:45:-5,523 01:45:-4,512 That'll kill you, ya know. 01:45:-4,624 Yeah, well, so will a car wreck. You're sitting on a high horse, boy. I never had talent; I did the best I could with what I had. Can you say that? Mr. Big Shot. Mr. Pill-popping rock star? Ray. Who are you to judge? You ain't got nothin'. Big, empty house. Nothin'. Children you don't see. Nothing. Big old, expensive tractor stuck in the mud. Ray... Nothin'. 01:46:-7,281 01:46:-6,248 Come on! 01:46:-4,584 01:46:-2,347 Do it! 01:46:-2,452 Come on... You son of a bitch, you. Come on! Do it! Do it! Come on! Come on! Sit in the middle this time. Come on, you son of a bitch! John? Oh, here's a fine piece of equipment! John! You should go down there to him, June. Mama. He's mixed up. I am not going down there. If I go down... You already are down there, honey. Do it! Do it! 01:47:-8,-27 01:47:-7,-60 More, more, more! 01:47:-5,476 01:47:-4,568 John! John! John! John! Ah! John! John. June? Come on. You should have left me. John? Go on ahead, J.R. 01:49:-6,595 01:49:-3,621 You know what that is, J.R.? 01:49:-3,732 Just please, get away from me.! Daddy? John? Hey, John? Oh, shit! Jesus! Hey! What? Hey, John? Get your ass out of here, boy! Hey, John! Get out of here! Take your poison with you! Okay! Hey. Mama and I picked these up down the road. They're good. It's good to see you again. Can I get you something else? Just stay. Okay. You're an angel. No, I'm not. You been here with me. I had a friend who needed help. You're my friend. But I done so many bad things. You done a few. That's true. 01:51:-7,280 01:51:-3,239 My daddy's right. 01:51:-3,351 Should have been me on that saw. Jack was so good. He would have done so many good things. What have I done? Just hurt everybody I know. I know I've hurt you. I'm nothing. You're not nothing. You are not nothing. You're a good man. And God has given you 01:52:-8,573 01:52:-3,-229 a second chance to make things right, John. 01:52:-3,-123 01:52:-1,038 This is your chance, honey. This is your chance. Morning. Hi, how are y'all? Hey, June? It's okay. Come on. What about the Tropicana? What's wrong with the Opry? He was banned after he smashed up the footlights. Well, if he smashes lights at Folsom... they're going to keep him there. Look, Frank. While Johnny was out recuperating... the world changed. Dylan's gone electric. The Byrds are electric. The Beatles are electric. Hell, everybody's electric. He needs a fresh sound... 01:55:-7,153 01:55:-5,383 and all he wants to do is cut a live album 01:55:-5,489 01:55:-3,719 with the same old pickers 01:55:-2,-175 01:55:-1,554 at a maximum-security penitentiary! 01:55:-1,660 You can talk to me, you know. I'm standing right here. And what's with the black? It's depressing. Looks like you're going to a funeral. Maybe I am. Your fans are church folk, Johnny. Christians. They don't want to hear you singing to a bunch of murderers and rapists... trying to cheer them up. Well, they're not Christians, then. I'm fine with you doing a live record. Just not at a prison. That's my compromise. January 13... I'll be at Folsom Prison with June and the boys. You listen to the tapes. You don't like 'em... you can toss 'em. Pardon me, Mr. Cash? M-Mr. Cash? Mr. Cash? Might I suggest you refrain from playing any more tunes that remind them- the, uh, the-the inmates, that is- well, that they're in prison? You think they forgot? Perhaps you and your wife could do another spiritual. That's not my wife, Warden. Keep asking her, and she keeps saying no. You ever drink this water, Warden? No. I'm a Coca-Cola man. All right! I want to remind you, we're recording live here today... so you can't say ""hell"" or ""shit"" or anything like that. I got to tell you, I can't tell you how many shows we done... but this is the best audience we ever had. I want to thank you for that. You know... standing back there in your shop, catching my breath... I come to admire you even more. Yeah! You see, I never had to do hard time like you... 01:58:-8,-101 01:58:-7,264 Yeah! 01:58:-7,367 01:58:-5,392 ...although I have on occasion... 01:58:-5,502 01:58:-3,-201 gotten myself busted. 01:58:-1,-94 Once in El Paso, I had this bag of... Oh... you heard about that? You been in El Paso, too? Well, anyways... I felt tough, you know? Like I'd seen a thing or two, you know? Well, that was till a moment ago... 'cause I got to tell you, my hat's off to you now. 'Cause I ain't never had to drink this yellow water you got here at Folsom. - All right. This song's for your warden. Boom! In the back. Hey, June. June. What's wrong, John? Oh... bad dreams, memories. 02:01:-7,713 02:01:-4,079 Well, you need to get some rest, sweetie. 02:01:-3,651 02:01:-1,551 You did good tonight. 02:01:-1,653 Well, we got another show tomorrow. Yeah. Hey, listen. The thing is... I think it's time now, you know? I think it's about time. Time for what? For you and me to get married. Go to sleep, John. I don't want to sleep. I want to marry you... and I'm telling you, it's the time. Well, I am telling you, with 100 certainty... that it is not the time. It's not about time. It's not the right time. It's not even quarter to the right time. June. How do you know? I mean... You haven't been clean even six months. Come on. 02:02:-8,105 02:02:-6,039 Except for a honeymoon, you have not even thought 02:02:-6,141 02:02:-5,631 about what you're asking me. 02:02:-5,742 02:02:-2,506 Yes, I have. 02:02:-2,612 I have. That's all I've thought about. Well, how's it going to work, John? Where we going to live? What about my girls? - What about your girls? - Well... What about your parents, John? Your daddy won't even look at me. June, that stuff will just work itself out. No, it does not work itself out. People work it out for you... and you think it works itself out. You're scared. What? You're scared of being in love. You're scared of losing control. And you know what, June Carter? I think you're scared of living in my big fat shadow. - That's your problem. - Oh, really? - Yeah. Yeah, it is. - Is that my problem? My problem is it's 2:00 a.m. My problem is I'm asleep. I'm on a tour bus with eight stinking men. Rule number one- don't propose to a girl on a bus. You got that? Rule number two- don't tell her it's because you had a bad dream. 02:03:-6,668 02:03:-4,-172 June? 02:03:-4,-64 02:03:-3,233 What? 02:03:-3,337 02:03:-1,-173 Marry me. Okay. Well, that's... that's the last time I'm asking. Well, good. I hate reruns. Hey, June? June? What's that, dear? June? I said... What's that, dear? What, you're not talking to me? You are not allowed to speak to me tonight. After that stunt you pulled on the bus... the only place you're allowed to speak to me is on stage. 02:04:-7,-174 02:04:-5,158 - Do you understand? - What did I do? 02:04:-5,262 02:04:-3,-43 I don't know. Why don't you ask your big fat shadow? 02:04:-3,063 02:04:-2,121 Come on, baby. 02:04:-2,231 02:04:-1,323 Come on, baby. 02:04:-1,432 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. 02:05:-4,056 02:05:-2,115 All right, thank you. I don't know if y'all know who wrote that song... but it's this long-legged gal standing right here... Miss June Carter. Thanks, ya'll. Thank you very much. So, uh, June, you going to stand over there all night... or you want to come over here and sing with me? I'll sing with you, Mr. Cash. You sure that's what you want? Yeah. All right. Okay. Well, folks, what do you say? You want to hear, uh, ""Jackson""? All right. Thought you was gonna wax poetic a little bit longer. No, I'm done with that, June. Oh, okay, good. 02:07:-6,140 02:07:-5,607 Sorry for the interruption, folks... 02:07:-5,708 but, uh, I got to ask June here a question before we finish this song. What's that, John? Will you marry me? Why don't we just sing the song, John? No, darling. Come on, finish the song. People want to hear us sing. Sorry folks, but, uh... I just can't do this song anymore... unless she's gonna marry me. It'd just be like we're lying. You got these people all revved up, John. - Now come on, let's sing ""Jackson"" for 'em. - You got me all revved up. I've asked you different ways and it's time you come up with a fresh answer. Please, sing. I'm asking you to marry me. I love you, June. 02:08:-3,537 Now I know I said and done a lot of things... that I hurt you, but I promise I'll never do that again. I only want to take care of you. I will not leave you like that Dutch boy with your finger in the dam. You're my best friend. Marry me. All right. Yeah? 02:09:-7,459 02:09:-4,519 In case none of y'all heard, she said ""yes""! She's finally said ""yes"". Grandpa, here, let's talk on this. What do you want me to do with it? Well, you... you listen and you talk. It's a tin can telephone. And the sound goes up the string. 02:10:-8,118 02:10:-5,747 Hello, grandgirls. Hello, grandgirls. 02:10:-4,-145 02:10:-4,753 Can you hear us? 02:10:-3,-144 02:10:-1,256 Hello, Roseanne. 02:10:-1,359 Hello, Carlene. You got to pull it tight, Daddy. Come on, Grandpa. Talk. Speak, Grandpa. - Tell us a story. - Speak. - Grandpa! - Tell us a story. Here, you take it, talk to them. No, they want to talk to their grandpa. I don't got no stories. You got all the stories, Shooter. Why don't you tell them about the flood? Tell them about how you made a boat out of the front door and got us all out of there. They'll like that. Tell us! Come on, tell 'em. You got to pull the string tight. It was 1937... There was a flood."
21,2000,Reindeer Games,American,"Nick Cassidy and Rudy Duncan are cellmates in prison two days away from release. Nick has been corresponding with a young woman named Ashley Mercer, who is waiting for him on the outside. After Nick takes a shiv in a prison fight and dies, Rudy, who just wants to have a cup of hot chocolate after he reunites with his family a week before Christmas, takes his place and lets the beautiful Ashley think he is the one who has been writing her. Gabriel, the leader of a gang who assaults Rudy and Ashley in their cabin, is Ashley's brother, telling ""Nick"" that the gang, with Nick's help, will rob the casino he used to work at. Rudy reveals he is not Nick, but Ashley continues to confirm he is and that she wrote to him knowing Gabriel was going to kidnap and force Rudy to assist in the robbery. Rudy, while furious with Ashley, is reluctantly forced to go along with his ruse.
Using the information from the real Nick’s prison cell stories, Rudy is able to devise a robbery plan and informs Gabriel that the biggest loot is hidden inside a safe in the manager’s office (the ""PowWow"" safe). On the night of the robbery, Rudy breaks out of his holding in order to find a way to arm himself as he knows Gabriel will kill him after the robbery. He stumbles upon Gabriel and Ashley and learns that they are lovers and partners in crime.
The group robs the casino, each dressed as Santa Claus. Rudy, forced to take part in the robbery, hides the fact that he knows Ashley’s secret. Shots are fired and security guards and Santas are shot. Ashley drives into the Casino and lets Nick/Rudy know she is in on the heist. All meeting in the manager's office, Gabriel introduces Rudy to the casino manager as Nick but the manager recognizes that he isn’t Nick and Rudy confesses. Gabriel, furious at Rudy’s deception, spares him for a moment when he demands to know where the ""PowWow” safe is. When the manager opens the safe, he grabs guns from inside and kills one of the robbers as the rest flee. The casino manager dies during the shootout. Rudy kills another one of the robbers and is then grabbed by Gabriel and Ashley who tie him up in their 18-wheeler truck.
They plan to drive him off the edge of a cliff in a burning vehicle with a little of the money so that officials will guess all had been burned. After accidentally revealing too much information during an argument with Rudy, Ashley shoots and kills the now suspicious Gabriel. Shortly after, Nick appears, having staged his death at the prison. It is revealed that Ashley's real name is Millie Bobeck and Rudy learns that the two had collaborated to rob the casino using Rudy and Gabriel and his gang. Ashley had known the entire time who Rudy truly was. Nick also informs Rudy that the prison stories were part of a set-up.
After they tie Rudy to the steering wheel to drive off the cliff, he produces a knife he had gotten earlier, cuts his bindings, hot wires the car, sets it to reverse and crushes Nick. With Ashley firing at him, he rams the fiery car into her and dives out as the car and Ashley go over the cliff. Nick tries to convince Rudy that they can share the money but Rudy locks him in the truck and also sends it over the cliff. Rudy picks up the stolen cash and begins distributing it in mailboxes he comes across on the way home to his family, and he eats a Christmas dinner with them. The film closes with Rudy smiling.",5.8,tt0184858,"To tell ya the truth, I never was much for the holidays. It's been forever since I'd known a holiday, since I'd seen my family, since I'd been with a girl, since I'd driven a car. You see, cars are what put me here: Iron Mountain, maximum security. I was riding a hard five for grand theft auto. Meanwhile, my esteemed raping and murdering colleagues were up for parole at three. World works like that sometimes. All the time in my experience. That's me, Rudy Duncan, menace to society, on the left. The guy on the right's Nick Cassidy, my best friend. Back then, we were both looking at three days to a new start. That's what ya talk about in prison. How you're gonna get it right. How you'll never make the same mistakes. We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do? Hot chocolate. - What? - That's the first thing I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go out and get myself a mug of hot chocolate. And a piece of pecan pie. That's right. A piece of pecan pie. Yeah. She's gonna be out there, man. She's gonna be right there waiting. She got us a motel on Highway 5. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinkin' wine, takin' baths, man. Huh? Yeah. Nick, all those pictures she sent? You sure that's really her in the pictures? I did hear sometimes these girls send pictures that's not really them. It's like their prettier cousin or somethin' like that. Why ya gotta say a thing like that, man? - I'm just sayin'- - Why ya gotta say a thing like that? I'm just sayin', maybe I should take her out. Spend a day or two with her. Make sure she's the right girl. Just a day or two. Maybe a night or two? Ah, whatever it takes. Just make sure you're gettin' the right merchandise. - You know? - You know what? Enjoy your hot chocolate, Rudy. I think I'll take my chances with Ashley. Yeah, I figured. I figured. - Hold it up close. - Pop gate three. Oh, shit! - What's up? - Alamo's back. Don't look like he missed the sunlight. Bro, I'm fucked. Pincher said he thinks I'm the one who ratted him out for beating up Creed. 'Cause I was there, he thinks I'm the reason he ended up in solitair. Fuck, Rudy. Move out! And stop! Move in! Listen to this. II've made my list and l've checked it twice. As long as you're naughty, it's gonna be nice. All that gets me through the day, is to close my eyes and imagine holding you, kissing you, touching you. Because I know I'll feel at that moment... I've found the reason for my whole entire life. "" She sounds pretty mature for 25. Yeah! You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick. Yeah. Either that or those pictures are ten years old. Sure as hell don't make me miss Millie Bobeck. Guess I owe Millie, though. If l hadn't been rolling her, I would've never ended up here. Yeah. You hadn't have cracked that guy's head open, you never would've found true love. Jealous. Ya know, Nick, what if she sees you and, you know, you just don't do it for her, you know, I mean physically? She just- It's not there. What're you gonna do? Well, me and her, we got a connection. Jesus Christ. Get this fuckin' shit... - out of my face. - You should've written to that magazine. I should've, yeah. I'm gonna walk outta here. I'm gonna walk right into a relationship. And you, my friend, will walk out with your bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room. That's right. ""Morning, gorgeous. More eggnog?"" - Should've written, Rudy. You'd have got yourself a girl. Yeah, should've done a lot of things. All I want is just to make it back to Sidnaw, sit down for Christmas dinner, sleep in my old bed, watch some ball games with my old man, eat leftovers for about six months. I just wanna go home. Keep the line movin'. - What's this? - Holiday Jell-O. - What this shit in it? - Swallow it and you'll see. Just so you know, this man and I are outta here in two days. So while we're inhaling London broil and lobster bisque, you're still gonna be standing here smelling up the myster cream fuck. Who's in prison now? Hey, Alamo, how ya doin'? Out of solitair, huh? Look good. Lose some weight? Look, man, it wasn't me. - It wasn't me. - Two days, man. Come on. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinkin' he might be able to get me some work. What work, security? I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. I gotta start doin' somethin' I got a stake in, get a business goin'. I don't know, man. I been in the business world. Hot-wiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify you as a small business. ""CChop-shop consultant"" doesn't work on a resume. I always wanted to be the boss of something, ya know? Have people working for me. Man, what's wrong with you? Monsters... in the gelatin. - It's just a roach, Zook. - Yeah, it's protein. It's good for ya. - Monsters... in the gelatin! - Calm down. There are monsters in the gelatin! Monsters... in the gelatin! Look at this shit! Hey! Jesus! - Sit down! - Son of a bitch! You eat this shit! - Get down, don't move. - Stay out of this. Stay out of it, Rudy! You want some fucking monsters? Two days, man. Fuck! Don't move! We had nothing to do with it! Rudy, watch out! Cassidy's down! Cassidy's stabbed! - I gotta be there. - Oh, my God! - Rudy, Ashley. - You're gonna be all right. - Hold on, hold on. Guard! Jesus, guards! - Ashley's gonna be there. - Nick, you gotta- - Gotta be- Guard! Guards! Jesus Christ. - Nick. Nick! Nick! - Get him outta here now! Nick! Nick! Nick! Nick! Nick! Nick! Nick! Well, at least he won't be comin' back. Ooh, you need some company tonight, Rudy, you just give me a holler. You gonna take that from him? You gonna take that shit, Rudy? Open outer gate. Your world and welcome to it, you dumb fucks. Don't be a stranger now. We'll keep the lights on for ya. Over here! Over here. Hey, how you doin'? And all that gets me through the day, is to close my eyes... and imagine holding you, kissing you, touching you."" Don't do it, Rudy. Don't you fucking do it! Jesus Christ. Are you Ashley? I'm Nick! At last My love has come along My lonely days are over Look, Ashley, I'm sorry. I was scared that I was gonna walk out there, and you were gonna take one look at me and just... turn around. I was scared l was walkin' into heartache. All those letters, those words, and you have a picture in your mind. I was scared you'd see me, and I just wouldn't be that... picture that you had in your mind. I figured you walked outta there and saw my clothes or something, and you just walked right the other way. - You know, maybe you saw my coat or my hair- - Hey, I like your coat! Maybe you, um- Maybe you saw me and I didn't- Ashley, no. That was me. I thought you said you, uh, had curly hair. I do. It's very curly. When it gets long, it's really curly. But I cut it short. I can grow it out again, if you want. I can get it pretty bushy. No! No, no, no. I want you to be who you wanna be. Do that again. What? Smile like that. Come on. One more time. God, I have been dreaming about that smile... for so long, Ashley Mercer. You're better than the pictures in my mind, Nick. You're real! Oh, the weather outside is frightful But the fire is so delightful And since we've no place to go Let it snow, let it snow let it snow Man, it doesn' t show signs of stoppin' And l've brought me some corn for poppin' The lights are turned way down low Let it snow let it snow When we finally kiss goodnight How l'll hate going out in the snow But if you really hold me tight All the way home I'll be warm And the fire is slowly dyin' And, my dear we're still ""good-byeing"" But as long as you love me so Let it snow, let it snow let it snow Mmm. - Can I ask you somethin'? - Mmm? Is this the first time you ever done somethin' like this? You, look at you. So pretty, sweet. Why were you writing to a guy, some con, you don't even know? - I told you, Nick. Remember? - Tell me again. All the guys I've ever been with, they never wanted to get to know me. Who I am... inside. They just wanted to... get inside. A guy like you, Nick. God, I mean, six months before you could even touch my face. I figure a guy like that... is gonna have to work to get to know me some other way. But when I read what you wrote to me, I said: ""Here's a guy they say is a criminal, but he's not."" Just protected his girl. Somebody got killed, but he's not a killer... 'cause he did what he had to do to save somebody. And the world just didn't see it that way. "" State of Michigan, anyway. You wrote me some wonderful things. It wasn't all me, you know. It was all you. The guy I was in with, you know, he helped me with some of the romantic stuff. He's a good guy, actually. You'd like him. I'm talkin' about the heart, not the words. Yeah, well, some of the heart might've been his too. Yeah? You should've signed his name, then he'd be here right now. Rockin' around the Christmas tree At the Christmas Party Hop Mistletoe hung where you can see Every couple tries to stop Rockin' around the Christmas tree Merry Christmas! Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas, Santa! Provisions, Nick. Provisions. Come here. You need a coat. No boyfriend of mine is gonna walk around in a negative five degree wind chill... without a good-looking goddamn coat. But you already got me all this stuff. I didn't get you anything. Nick, you got out. You're here. You're my Christmas. It's 200, Ash. I know! But you forget where I work. - Beauty and fragrances. - Yep. Fifty percent off, my friend. Ho, ho, ho. Just till the holidays, Nick. We'll let her have her holidays, then we'll tell her. I'm gonna tell them not to bother us for the rest of the year. When I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane. I have no gifts to bring Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum A gift to give a King I've got a girl- Hi, Nick. Ah, shit! I owe you a drink! Welcome home, Nick. Look, man, you don't know me. Ohh, I know ya. - I know you real well. - You can't. The hell I can't. - Watch out, baby, - Ashley! I'm bringin' in the tree! Looks like somebody's been havin' some fun. Hey, sis, happy holidays. No! You bastard! No! - Take it easy. Don't hurt her. - Right. Sorry, Monster. So, this is the guy you've been waitin' for, the man of your dreams. Gabriel, what are you doing? - I read a lot about you, Nick. - Gabriel, what are you doing here? I read you're a man of some knowledge. - Gabriel. - A man of some travels. Look, man, I'm not him. Whatever you want from Nick, you got the wrong guy. - Nick? - I'm sorry, Ashley. I'm sorry. No! No! - Who are you now? - I'm not him, man! - She just thinks I'm Nick. I'm not him. - Put him in the truck. Wait a minute! I was in the joint with him. That's how I knew about him and her. I took his place. - You what? - Okay. I got out. Nick didn't. I knew about her letters, and Jesus Christ, man, whatever you want from Nick, I'm not him, okay? I just- I wanted to be. You're not Nick Cassidy? No, man, I just shared his cell. But you were saying you were. Yeah. So you could get with my sister. Yeah. - So you could get down her chimney. - Yeah. And you think tellin' me, that's gonna help your cause. No! No! No! - Is this him? - Please don't hurt him, Gabriel. Don't! - Is this the fucker you been writin' all year? - Don't! Please, don't. - Is this Nick Cassidy? - Yes! Yes! Well, he better learn to give you some respect. - Get her outta here. - No! No! Man, they got a shitload of cookies. Take 'em. What about the tree? - You want the tree? - Yeah. I read your letters, convict. Don't play no reindeer games with me. He read your letters. One day I wasn't there and he came in. Jane tried to stop him, but he read your letters. What letters? He knows you worked at that casino. What? Oh, my God, you set him up! No, no, I didn't. I didn't. When did you decide to do it, Ash? Huh? After which one of his letters? What, the fortieth, fiftieth? The first? What? - No, Nick, you're not- - Look, I'm not Nick! Okay? You thought you'd fuck him over? Ah, shit! Guess what? He fucked you! Because I never worked in any casino, and I can't help you because I'm not him! - No, you don't understand. I love you! - Jesus... - Christ! - Hey, hey, watch your mouth. It's Christmas. Listen to me. Listen to me. My brother has killed people. I know this. You don't know him. You don't know what he's capable of. He will kill you. If you keep telling him that you're not you, he will kill you. Says here the retail industry does fifty percent of its business... between December and December 25. That's half a year's business in one month's time. It seems to me an intelligent country would legislate a second such gift-giving holiday. Create, say, a Christmas Two, late May or early June, to further stimulate growth. Ever since you been goin' to night school, you been giving me headaches, Jumpy. Christmas Two. Just- My sweet, sexy Ashy-lashy. I have been dreaming of you constantly, and knowing you are out there makes these walls... not seem so close or so strong or so cold. Someday I'm gonna take you up by Lake Superior. Before I went in, before goddamn Millie, I used to work up at this casino, workin' security. I used to watch for people stealin' chips, counting cards, getting piss-drunk, that kind of stuff. Indian place. Easiest job I ever had."" You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing... an A-plus. You just tell us what we need to know, and you two kids, you get to go live happily-ever-after. You give me little nieces and nephews. - Listen to me, man. I never worked at a casino. - No, Nick. That guy who wrote that letter? That's Nick Cassidy. I was in the joint with him. He rode a two-year manslaughter bit... for killing some guy who was bothering his girlfriend in a bar. He's dead. He wrote those letters. He worked at a casino. Me? My last job was at a Quick Lube. I did five for lifting cars. That's it. He was my cellmate. That's how l know him. I'm sorry about your sister. I just got out of the joint. I- I-I just wanna- I don't know anything. I don't remember anybody. I just wanna go home. - Bury this guy. - No. Gabriel, no. - What? - Gabriel, you promised. - I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone. When he helped us. This guy doesn't wanna play. No, you promised me! And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help! He'd rather die... than be with you. He'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway. Bur this guy all over the place. No. No! Gabriel, no! Shut up! Don't get no blood on my shoes. All right, all right, all right. What do you want to know? About the casino, the Tomahawk? Jesus Christ, what do you wanna know? Six months writing love letters, my pen pal fucks me over. Thanks for the stamps, Ash. All right. What do you wanna know? Everything. Nick, I love you, baby. - Nick, I love you. - Hey! She said she loves you. Say something. I had better sex in prison. Throw him back in the rig. Monster, he's not the guy. Whole time you were drivin', he was tellin' her he's not the guy. He's not the guy, l understand Why he'd tell us he's not the guy, but why would he tell her that he's not the guy? Maybe- Maybe he's not the guy. Look, if l went in the joint with a library card, I'd come out with a library card. The man who wrote those letters loved Ashley, boys. He lived for her. Where's she work? What? Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work? Lindstrom's, beauty and fragrances. - What's her middle name? - Uh, Samantha. What'd they call her in high school? Bam-Bam. - What'd they call her in college? - What college? - What's her greatest fear? - Brother. Ooh, oh, wrong. It's drowning. Wrong, it's her brother. That's love. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start tellin' tales. - Get him up here. - No, no, no! Fuck that! Nick doesn't do anything till Nick gets something for Nick. Ya got it? I want some hot chocolate. You wanna hear about some job of mine? I wanna see some goddamn hot chocolate... and some pecan fuckin' pie! Mmm, sure nice pie. So, when you worked there- You knew the place- Okay. You know what? I could really go for some onion rings. You said talk. That's all you s- Gabriel, you said you wanted to talk. - How much money is in that casino? - Hard to say. Well, take a guess. Five million? - Jesus. Come here. - You, uh, you wrote Ash a letter with a story... about working Christmas Eve. About how they send half the security guys home. Nobody's comin' in and out. And the rest of ya are gettin' shit-faced. That a true story or not? Uh, Christmas Eve. We're takin' down that casino, convict. And you're the guy that's gonna tell us how. That's what we can see. Now, you tell us what we can't see. Where the private doors go, where the alarms are, what the upstairs looks like, all of it. - That's not the Tomahawk. - What the hell are you talkin' about? What's this, the cage? I mean, the cage is over here. Ya got- This whole thing's mixed up. - That's what it looks like, Romeo. - Since when? I mean, what's this? - That's the prime rib buffet. 5.99. - Buffet? Buffet is over here by the bar. They must've remodeled the place. - What? - Big guy, the boss. - The guy that ran the place, was in charge. - Jack Bangs. Jack Bangs! Was always talkin' about giving the place a makeover. Must've gone ahead and done that while I was in the Mountain. I mean, this thing's all changed around. I can't help you with this. I don't know where security or anything is. - I have no idea. - Look I don't care about the pancake breakfast. I- You wanna know about money, right? Okay. Where you got the buffet down here? That used to be Bang's office. And he kept a safe in there. And that safe had all the money that he was skimming in there. - And it was called the pow-wow safe. - Pow-wow safe? Yes, pow-wowsafe. 'Cause he was stealing money from the tribe. The guy had thousands in there. Millions probably. Millions? In the pow-wow safe? Millions. But, I mean, you know, it's just that now you tell me his office is moved. God knows what else is different. You know? The security, the- You want me to show you what goes where, I have no idea! Well, I guess we don't need you then. Well, not necessarily. Because, if you get me inside, then I know where the money moves. I know the security routines. I know their signals to each other. I know how they operate. You get me in there, then I can work with this map, and I can tell you if anything's changed. Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you. So what? If they recognize him, they'll remember him when the job goes down. - They won't recognize me. Trust me. - Why not? 'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise. What happened to working together? You'd rather be back in the Mountain? - Might as well be. Don't get channels in the Mountain. Sleep well. Tomorrow you got singin' for your supper to do. Help yourself. Sure, take that. I don't need it. Nick. Nick. Let me help you. - Get your own room, Ashley. Get your own room. - Let me help you. He said when you come out, he wants to talk to you. That's all! I thought he meant after New Years, back in Detroit. - But you knew what he wanted. Right? - I thought we had more days. For what? What are you gonna do? Talk me into helping? You know how I feel about my brother! You know how I hate him. What did you think's gonna happen? This thing's gonna be over and he's gonna let me go? He's gonna shoot me in the back of the head like this! Or I'm back in prison for the rest of my life, and that's it for me! This is my life too, you know. You think he's just gonna let me walk? You think he's not gonna take this out on me? I'm in this too, and I'm really scared. Please! Nick. Nick. Do you remember all those letters you wrote me? About me and you against the whole world? God! You know, it's just my luck. I finally meet a boy that I'm crazy about, and my brother wants him worse than I do. Why didn't you tell me your brother was a criminal? Gabriel knows some guys in Miami and New York. Guys that he helps get guns to Detroit. - That's it. That's all I know. - And that's who he's working for on this one? No. He doesn't wanna work for anyone. - What's the last place they took down? - What? Monster and his merry men. What's the last place they robbed? Who they ripped off? What did they do? I don't think they've robbed anywhere before. They just- They drive guns! They've never done a robbery? Really? They really do need me. They actually need me. Oh, yeah, candles burnin' low Lots of mistletoe A cowboy. You're sending me into an Indian casino dressed like a cowboy. - Thought this through entirely? - It was that or a ballerina. Well, I mean, I'm gonna need some money. It is a casino. - Ten bucks? What am I gonna do with ten bucks? - Don't tip. Look, if we're gonna be workin' together, you shouldn't send me in there like the Lone Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You want me to not get noticed. Not gettin' noticed costs at least a couple hundred. Ante up, boys.

You wanna know the one thing holding us back from greatness? Snow. S-N-O-fucking-W. Snow. There is no snow in Las Vegas, okay? They don't want it. They don't need it. As a matter of fact, I think they have laws against the shit. You guys hired me because you wanted Las Vegas quality. I brought it to you. You wanted Las Vegas press. I gave that to you. But I cannot give you Las Vegas profits... until you people get together around a campfire, smoke a pipe, and do some kind of spirit dance about this goddamn snow! They did a lot of work. This restaurant here is the main expansion. And, uh, they moved the games around. Do you know that guy? Yeah, that's, uh- that's Mike. Mike. He works here. Spend some of your brother's money.

He just wanted to know how I heard about the place. Just fuckin' tone down a little bit, all right? Ease up off me. Oh, my God! I'm sorry. Jesus Christ. I'm sorry Here, hold this. What are you doing? Security's not all that changed. Let me go clean this up. - What was that? - His face fell off. Take this.

Monster, he was talkin' to the manager inside there. There he is! Go, go, go, go! Come on! Get him back! Keep on running, Romeo! Keep on running! As fast as you go, we'll get there! - We're truckers, motherfucker! We drive for a living! Help! Help! He thinks he's gettin' away. Oh, shit! No! Come on. Come on! We gotta get to those trees.

He won't remember us. Don't do it. Shut the fuck up! No! Oh, God! - What's this? What's this? This isn't the Tomahawk. No. No, I've never seen this before. They must have given the place a makeover. Yeah! The buffet was over here, the blackjack was over here, the bar used to be over here. I don't know. I can't help you. I have no idea. I have no idea! Somethin' tells me you're not being totally honest with me. What'd you tell that casino manager? - Nothin'. Nothin'. - You was talking to him. What'd you tell him? Nothin'. He thought I was some gambler. Nothin' I said. Maybe something about a robbery? No, man, I swear to- I swear to God. Jesus Christ, man! He thought I was some gambler! He didn't know me, man! He didn't recognize me! Jesus Christ! I've been drivin' rigs a long time, convict. Four, five million miles of road. Hard road. Tell 'em I was tired, shit, they'd just hire someone else. A thousand miles by sundown or the gang don't eat come sunrise. Sh-Shit. And every road, every mile, it's nothin' but moms and pops and car-seat kiddies giving me that look... - to go to hell and get off their happy goddamn highway. So- So I have worked... and I have slaved, and I have waited... for the highways to split open... and for the rivers to roil and for God in the heavens... to reach down and show me some sign of my reward, to grant me with my gift and say to me, Gabriel, my son, you are done with the road. Well, convict, that gift was granted. Look, man, I swear to God, he just wanted to know how I heard about the place, that's all. He didn't know it was me, Gabriel. He didn't know it was me! Please! Man, Monster, just don't start trying to hit me. Nick, I've been trying to hit you. Because I do not deserve to be in some shit-bag motel... in the middle of bum-fuck Michigan, throwing darts at a worthless... convict! You know- You know somethin'? My little sister- she deserves a world better than you. Tonight we're gonna take one more look at that map, and this time, you better have somethin' worth saying. What did they do to you, Nick? He had some... points to make. What the fuck did you do to him? Bastard. Get out! Get out! Just get out! Okay. Come here. Jesus. There you go. Okay. All I wanted to do was to make it back to Sidnaw... and have some of Mom's gravy, you know, and some of Aunt Elizabeth's cranberry cakes. She makes 'em with, uh, real cranberries. It's... really good. - We'll get there, baby. - Jesus. We'll get there. Shh. Just rest, okay? You saved my life, Nick. You could've run, but you didn't. - You saved me. - You saved me. I saved you because I love you, Nick. Why did you save me? The guy I was in with- Rudy, the car thief- sometimes I read him your letters. I mean, I know they were private, but, you know, I'd read 'em to him, and he'd get this look on his face. I swear, I think he imagined you were writing to him. And I know sometimes, I think, he fell in love with you too. You gave a couple of guys hope, Ashley. Hope is a good thing. We're gonna get out of this... together. I promise you. I promise you. Start singing, Nick. I have no gifts to bring Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum A gift to give a King It's a joke, anyways. Uh- All right. What you wanna do, um, is get to the top level up here. Okay? And you do that through this door on the western wall. Um, when you- You wanna get to the security, and then from the security you get down to the cashier cage, and then you go into the count room. There'll be a guard in there, but he doesn't have a gun. Uh, the door's accessed by a keypad. - Uh, the cashier'll know the code. - What about the pow-wow safe? That's upstairs! Y- You'll wanna get to that. We're gonna get to the pow-wow safe. That's good. We're gonna get there. What you wanna do is, you got to get a guy in the cage... and a guy on the floor and somebody up top. Then you need a sweeper on the side, uh, lookout out front and somebody watching the back. So that's... how many? That's six. Well, we got five. We're keeping Ashley outside. And you need six. No. I- Look, man, I'm not making this shit up, you know? You go in there with five guys, you're gonna either leave an exit or an alarm unguarded. - No. - I know what I'm talking about. Raise your hand if you've ever done a robber before. Anyone? Anyone? Who's done- done a robbery, raise your hand. Okay. I have. You need six, Gabriel. You do. What are you gonna do about it? All right. I want a drawing of that security level. Every door, every guard, every ashtray. Yeah. All right. So, six guys, that's six guns. No way. Well, what am I gonna do? I'm no threat without a gun. - No, you're not. - What's the matter, Gabriel? Huh? Isn't this what you wanted him for? - Areas of expertise? - No guns. Well, you know, fine. It's up to you. What you've got to figure out is how you're gonna get up to that security level... without anybody knowing anything's wrong. I can tell you right now, going in there with A.K.s and ski masks... ain't gonna do that. Well, that part, Nick, was planned out the day I read your letters. Oh, yeah. What? We're all gonna dress up like cowboys? No, no, not cowboys, Nick. Not on Christmas Eve. You gotta be kidding me. 'Tis the season, convict. Ho, ho, ho. Coming up at 11:00... on the channel five news, these top stories. - The search intensifiies for a Michigan man... - Here's your Picasso. reported missing this morning on the Tallahassee Lake. - Investigators suspect foul play to be involved. - It better be. Also, lottery fever- How long have you guys been going out? - Set us up with free drinks. - Oh, yeah. Shit! Only guy in the gun club who doesn't keep a gun in his truck. Shit! Fucker decided to build him a silicone tongue... so that the boy could talk. Now, you ever see a motherfucker with a breast-implanted tongue? This guy I'm talking about- black-ass lung is the least of his problems, man. He had so much smoke comin' out of his skin, - people would say, ""Hey, where's the barbecue?"" - Yeah. No! No! No! Get away from me, goddamnit! Stay the hell away from me. You want me to scream? I'll fucking scream, I swear to God. Listen, I was just trying to stop him. - You just about killed me! When I saw you fall, I could have put the gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger. I swear to God, you're the best thing that ever happened to me. I know that you have to be with him, but it is killing me. Gabriel, we just have to keep doing this, and- He's helped us do the map. He's done what we need. We don't need him anymore. No! Jesus! You drive me crazy, you know that? - Hey- - No! You listen to me, because we have to be smart about this. The more he wants me, the more his help's for real. He's manpower. - That's all he is. He wants the money. No, baby. He wants me. Your little sister. If only Ma and Pop- Could see us now. If only this guy would play the game by the numbers. From where I stand, the only thing he's been doing right so far... is fucking my girlfriend. Baby. - He's nothing. Nothing. - See you later, assholes. Who's Jumpy calling? Which one? - Ex-wife, probably. All the ex-wives he's got, he's probably gonna have to take down three casinos. - You track down Gabriel? - Nah, he's with his girlfriend, making up for lost Nicky time. Come on. Let's go get a drink. No, I should go and check on Romeo. Go smile on the motherfuckerin love. Shit! You know what? I'll meet you in the bar. Fuck! Hmm. Come on. Come on. Give me something. I can hot-wire cars. I should fuckin' hot-wire a hotel room. Damn. Mmm. Who's slamming doors? How ya doin'? And your, uh- your charges, sir. Happy holidays. - That's for the hundred bucks' worth of pay-per-view. That's for the two hundred you took out of the mini bar. - That's enough! - It was on my credit card! I figured since you guys were paying for the room- So, you wanted a weapon, convict? Ahh! Don't! Don't! Ah! Well, now, look at what Santa's dwarves have brought you. What do you say to Santa's dwarves? Elves. Santa's elves. You say, Thank you, motherfucker. You hang around with criminals, you end up making a lot of plans. But all the jobs l ever pulled, all the cars l ever stole, no plan ever went down the way it had been drawn up. My plans to escape never worked. And being on parole, going to the police wasn't an option. What's the matter? You nervous? Right now you're just a truck driver. You haven't done anything wrong yet. If you do this, you're gonna spend the rest of your life wishing you hadn't. Thanks for the reminder, Nick. Relax. Have a drink. Rum-pum-pum-pum-pum Ain't that your thing? Hey, hey! Thirsty! This diversion you're doing- you'd better do it just the way Monster planned. Or there ain't gonna be no more rest of your life. - And all through the house, not a creature was stirring. Why don't you send most of your boys home, Ed. Tom, why don't you go spend Christmas with your family. Don, you can shove off. Merry Christmas, Jack. Nobody even comes here to cheat. Ho, ho, ho!

Who's Nick? Oh. Drop your gun! All right, all right, all right! You motherfucker! No guns in the count room! Fuck you! - No guns in the count room! - Forget about him and get the money! Forget about him and get the fucking money! Forget about him. There's no future for people like you and me, Nick. The places we come from- plant towns, mill towns, small lives! No future, just more of the same! You want a future, you gotta stand up and steal it. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, my God. The pow-wow safe! I want the pow-wow safe! Where is it? I can't go back- I can't go back to Las Vegas. Fuck! I do not give a shit about Vegas! The money is in the car. - Let's get out of here right now. - He won't tell us where it is. - What? - The pow-wow safe. Remember Nick Cassidy? A security guard named Nick Cassidy? Yeah, Nick Cassidy. Nick- Where is he? Gabriel, we have enough money. Let's get the fuck out of here. Where is he? That's not Nick Cassidy. Nick Cassidy worked for me two years ago. Cowboy. Hop-along. Fuck! It's the story of your life, Ash. You fucked the wrong guy! Rudy Duncan, honey. Are we still gonna spend Christmas together? - You fucking bastard! - Hey. Hey, hey, hey. No, goddamn it! You are lucky, convict. You're gonna be spending Christmas with the birthday boy Himself. Wait a minute. There is a pow-wow safe. All right? There is a pow-wow safe. I did time with Nick Cassidy. Some shit he told me, some shit l remember. He told me the manager keeps a secret stash in his office. - A pow-wow safe. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - No, there is no safe! He's stalling us! - He told me! He said it! - There is no safe! - l overheard it! - He's been stalling us from day one. There's no safe. - There's a pow-wow safe! - I heard it! - Then where the fuck is it? Behind the liquor cabinet. Oh, Jesus! - Hey, hey! - Oh, please. - Get up. Get up. Open it. - Oh, please, sir. - I can't go back to Vegas. I can't go- - I don't give a fuck about that! Get up! Open it! Hurry up! Pow-wow. Hey, Santa Claus! Welcome to the Tomahawk! Oh, shit! Get up. Yeah. God... is good. Now, what do you say... to Santa's dwarves? - Hmm? - You say, Thank you. Never make the same mistake twice. You just did. I picked the wrong guy. We took the place down with the wrong guy! Is this Christmas, huh? Is this Christmas? God bless us, everyone. Come on. Smart, aren't you? So smart. You're smarter than everybody, huh? Pow-wow safe. A little gift for us in the pow-wow safe. Well, I've got a gift for you from Pug and Merlin and Jumpy, you son of a bitch. You're going where they went, and they're gonna find you there, - and they're gonna kick your fucking ass! You feel smart? Huh? You think you're lucky? Well, let's see how lucky you are. Come on! Here's how lucky you are. You got out of the Tomahawk, into your car, made it halfway to Canada until you caught some ice in the road. Get down there! Take a look! By the time you hit the bottom down there, the whole car was burning like a comet. Must have burned up all that money too. Was it your idea, Monster? Or was it hers? Well, she told me about the convict magazines. Had to figure there'd be some guys in the pen with some useful knowledge... with nobody to talk to and nobody to listen. So, we just stocked up on stationery. It's a hard life being a trucker's girl. Aw, baby. Come here. - I saved your life. - You shouldn't have. He really loved you, you know that? Nick. He really loved you. Who wouldn't? Maybe this is where you wanted him, Ashley. Some stranger at the bottom of a ravine with a burned-up heart. Maybe. But it didn't happen. - 'Cause what you did for him - you made him the happiest he'd ever been. - Shut up. Get up. Come on. - Get in the car! - Get in the car! Hey. Hey! Gabriel! Don't go getting all noble with me, Rudy. A guy takes a shift for you, you go chasing his girlfriend? - Don't talk to me about greed! - What? What did you say? I said, Don't talk to me about greed! No, not about that. About- You said, A guy takes a shift for you. I never said anything about a shift. How'd you know there was a shift? You said it. You said the real Nick died saving you. No, I didn't. I said he died. - I never said how. - Yes, you did. No. I never said how. I said he died. - You said he was stabbed. - I said he died. I never said how. You said he was stabbed- that he took a shift, a knife, a shank, whatever. - Ash? - How'd she know it was a shift? Ash? How'd she know? Jesus Christ. Men! Ooh! Merry Christmas, Rudy. We made it, baby. Oh, yes, we did. We made it. It got a little messy, but... I'll tell you all about that once we're on the road. For your information, I never fuck the wrong guy. So, Rudy, I want you to meet Millie Bobeck. Remember Millie Bobeck, don't you? My girlfriend before I went in. Worked in that bar in Motor City where I manslaughtered What's-His-Name. See, Millie here, she used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers. Real big talkers, scheming about a real score one day. Two years in the Mountain, man. What the hell? Why not let her get friendly with them? Tell them her real name was Ashley. Tell them about this idea she had... about writing guys in prison. Find a sucker who could show them a sure thing. - Oh. - You know, they would have never done it without you, Nick. Tsk. I mean, Rudy. l always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy, way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me? Paid the Alamo a hundred to put the shift in me. He's a lifer, man. What does he care? He was supposed to stab me in the yard later that day. But when the food fight started, man, I couldn't believe it. A slash across the ribs, a little homemade blood capsule... gets you a nice, warm hospital bed. Paid a guard to spread the word I'd bought it. And once the wound healed up, got out of the Mountain this morning. Tonight, I'm a rich man. Get in the car. Keep your gun on him, honey. How'd you know I'd do it? Because every time I read her letters, Rudy, you listened. Besides, man, if you hadn't taken the bait, we'd have still had a shot. She'd have just had to convince 'em they could do it alone. But what do you know? Good ol' Rudy came through. Good old predictable Rudy. Goes for the easy money... every time. Five Santas walked into that Tomahawk, Rudy. That's what the witnesses will say. So we gotta have five Santas not walk out. Gotta have five. How many things could have gone wrong? Huh? A thousand. You think we don't know what a long shot is? Huh? My girl Millie was steering you, man. You fucked it up, she would have cut and run. They'd be looking for Ashley Mercer. Whoever she is. Six months of telling you Tomahawk stories. I guess now you know why. You gave 'em the confidence to walk in there, Nick Cassidy. That's all we needed you to do. You said some nice things about me, man. I appreciate it. You know what? You're right. I do love her. And she- She loves me. You had that part right all along. It's Christmas, sugar plum. Let's light up the tree. Shit! Shit! Write me. Aw, shit! It's like riding a bike. Like riding a bike. Good-bye, Rudy, my man. Nice spending... time with you! - Rule one: Never put a car thief behind the wheel! No! No! Five Santas walked into that Tomahawk, Rudy. That's what the witnesses will say. So we gotta have five Santas not walk out. Gotta have five. Rudy. Rudy, you and me, man. You and me. We can split the money, huh? Hmm? Rudy, that whore, Millie Bobeck? You think I was serious about her, man? I was gonna kill her. You gotta believe me. You gotta believe me. I swear it. - Believe me! - Believe this. Rudy! Rudy, help me! Rudy! Come, they told me Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum A newborn King to see Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum Our finest gifts we bring Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum To lay before the King Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum Rum-pum-pum-pum Rum-pum-pum-pum So to honor Him Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum When we come I have no gift to bring Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum That's fit to give our King Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum Rum-pum-pum-pum Rum-pum-pum-pum All I wanna do is make it back to Sidnaw, sit down for Christmas dinner, watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my own bed, have leftovers for about six months, eat some of that Christmas turkey. Like I said, I never was much for the holidays... until now."
22,2013,Lone Survivor,American,"In Afghanistan, Taliban leader Ahmad Shah is responsible for killing over twenty United States Marines, as well as villagers and refugees who were aiding American forces. In response to these killings, a United States Navy SEALs unit is ordered to execute a counter-insurgent mission to capture Shah. As part of the mission, a four-man SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team is tasked with locating Shah. These four SEALs include team leader Michael P. ""Murph"" Murphy; snipers Marcus Luttrell and Matthew Axelson; and communications specialist Danny Dietz.
The team is inserted into the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan, where they make a trek through the mountains. Here, they begin to encounter communications problems, which will play a critical role in the following events. Upon arriving at their designated location, the SEALs are accidentally discovered by an elderly shepherd and two teenage goat herders. Knowing that if they release them, the herders will likely alert Taliban to their presence, the team is split about whether to kill the herders or not. After a brief debate, Luttrell convinces the others that they will incite backlash if they kill the three herders. The team decides to release them and abort the mission, but before they can escape, they are discovered by Taliban forces. Although they manage to kill several Taliban gunmen, they find themselves heavily outnumbered and at a significant tactical disadvantage. Each of the men suffers serious injuries during the firefight and, in an attempt to flee from the insurgents, they jump off the edge of a precipitous ridge and into a large ravine.
Despite their injuries, the SEALs made a defensive retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts questions to Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the team's position to the Taliban. Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge to flee from the Taliban fighters. Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is shot in the shoulder; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall forward off the cliff. A dying Dietz remains at the top of the cliff and is killed by the Taliban insurgents. Murphy decides to try climbing back up the cliff to get a phone signal in order to call in support forces via satellite phone. Axelson and Luttrell shoot at the Taliban fighters to provide Murphy with cover. When he finally reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert the SEAL base of his team's location and request emergency assistance right before he is shot dead by Taliban fighters.
In response to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force team assembles, boards two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, and heads toward the location without gunship escort seeking to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert the arriving forces, the Taliban insurgents shoot down one of the helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators who were on board. The second helicopter is forced to turn back. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and a badly injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact causes him to land at the bottom of a rock crevice where he is able to hide from the Taliban fighters.
Luttrell stumbles upon a small body of water and submerges himself, only to find upon surfacing that a local Pashtun villager, Mohammad Gulab, has discovered his location. Gulab takes Luttrell into his care, returning to his village, where he attempts to hide Luttrell in his home. Gulab then sends a mountain man to the nearest American air base to alert military forces to Luttrell's location. The Taliban fighters arrive at the village to capture and kill Luttrell, but Gulab and the villagers intervene, threatening to kill the fighters if they harm Luttrell. The fighters leave, but later return to punish the villagers for protecting Luttrell. Gulab and his fellow militia are able to fend off several fighters during the ensuing attack. American forces, arriving via helicopters, shatter the advancing Taliban and, in the process, kill the bulk of the insurgents with concentrated weaponry fire. The American forces evacuate Luttrell back to base.
Photos of the real-life Marcus Luttrell, Mohammad Gulab and the fallen service members who died during the mission are shown during a four-minute montage, and an epilogue reveals that the Pashtun villagers agreed to help Luttrell as part of a traditional code of honor known as the Pashtunwali.",7.5,tt1091191,"Six times three. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Hurry up. It's eighteen. Ooh! Ring the bell three times, put your helmet on the ground. You're done. Commence! You don't make it, you do it again! You ever been tested this hard ever in your life? Never. Winning here is a conscious decision. Make up your mind if you want to pass or choose to fail. All right now, gentlemen, I'm gonna introduce y'all to something called ""not being able to breathe."" Andrew! Come back. Come back to the light. All this shaking and all this cold. Harness it. Turn it into aggression. You just proved to your bodies, through your mind, that you can push yourself further than you thought possible. Go get wet! Run! I'm at my limit, so... ...that's it. You sure you want to be here? Yes, I do. Are you absolutely sure? I'm positive! Whatever you have to do! Just find an excuse to win. Keep going. It pays to be a winner! I like having my buddies that I can depend on. And I would like for them to be able to depend on me. These guys are our band of brothers. Silent night Holy night All is calm All is bright. There's a storm inside of us. I've heard many team guys speak of this. A burning. A river. A drive. An unrelenting desire to push yourself harder and further than anyone could think possible. Pushing ourselves into those cold, dark corners. Where the bad things live. Where the bad things fight. We wanted that Fight at the highest volume. Aloud fight. The loudest, coldest, darkest, most unpleasant of the unpleasant fights. Is this doable? It's expensive. How much? It's an Arabian horse, man. She got good taste. I know. How much? I'll find out. Expensive. You're fucked, man. I know. I'm up. Going down. Murphy by 1.1. More than that. More than that, Marcus. Fucking dude, I was being generous. Trust me. Who won? Murph. Murph, barely. By one second. Barely. Barely. Head shave? Head shave or what? I don't know, you know? It's something to think about. If I shave his head, I have to focus on his face. Face, ears. Oddly-shaped head. Well, I don't wanna be looking at him that close, either, but he has been running his mouth about beating you. Really? Fuck, a head shave is fair. Axe? Better shave him. Make him go eat with the E-3s, work in the chow hall until it grows back. Frankie, what do you think? Why the fuck wouldn't we shave him? That's valid. Patton, not that we care, but what do you think? Let me see you make a tactical decision right now. Well, I could go both ways on this. He did lose, but he was close. And you're Mike Murphy. You are Mike Murphy. The Mike Murphy. I would've expected a bigger separation. That is a good point. Backhanded compliment. Patton. Grab my razor. Razor, copy that. Listen up. Red Wings' a go. Tonight, 1800. Beautiful. Am I going? PLO in an hour. Maybe I'll go. It's a maybe. I'll give you a maybe. Stay optimistic. Boys. Hey, what's up? What the fuck am I doing wrong? Oh, come on. I'll tell you what, Shane, here's your first op. You ready? Clean all this up. The objective of this mission is to capture and kill Ahmad Shah. Bad guy. Senior Taliban commander responsible for killing Marines in eastern Afghanistan. A Tier I target. If you want a positive I.D., note that Shah has no earlobes. Taraq. His right-hand man. Seems to do most of his chief shit for him. We're going in with a four-man Recon team. Axelson, you'll be point. Myself, I'll be second. Dietz, comms. Marcus, rear, med. Axe, give us our route. We're gonna be moving up the back side of this Mountain here, which is gonna offer great concealment from the village. I'm estimating that it's gonna take us between three and four hours, depending upon the gradient of the terrain which is that crappy shale. So please lace up. First things first. You're gonna win the fight. No medicine in a gun fight. Two weeks ago, Team was near where we're gonna be. Capelli got bit by a rattlesnake. Contrary to popular belief, there is poison oak, so watch your cock and balls, 'cause that will suck. Murph's got the sat phone. The angle of this region is very steep. Expect typical comms problems. We're gonna be on two-hour comms windows. If we miss two windows, I'd say wake somebody up. If not, don't sweat it. Way point one is Budweiser. Way point two is Miller. Three is Corona. Four is Heineken. And for our O.P. 1, Schlitz Malt Liquor. And if and when we I.D. Shah, pass Rick James. Gentlemen, these are your Rules of Engagement. US forces will comply with the Law of Armed Conflict at all times. Use of deadly force is authorized. Allahu Akbar! If you do come under attack, use the appropriate force necessary to deter or defeat that threat. Leaving here at 1800. Two Chinooks and two Apaches. We fly here to the L.Z., insert the four-man team right here. Then we fly minutes to J-Bad. Here, we'll have team guys and about a dozen Marines standing by all night. When we hear ""Schlitz Malt Liquor"", we're heading back to Ba-gram for phase two. The QRF will stay here at J-Bad. Now the Apaches stay with the Black Hawks. The movement is so we can get the 47's back here ready to bring up to phrase two, once you get eyes on Shah. Oh, I bringing up tomorrow night's new guy presentation to today, so that all may revel and partake. You better be good, Napoleon. Fuck. A lot of moving parts. We were going to wait and then she gets her head into it and when she gets her head into something, that's it. There's no stopping her, man. She's going all out. You know, you should just let her do it. You got a handyman woman. That's a good thing. He's afraid of losing control over his castle. He's having control issues 'cause he's the one who's always made the taste decisions in the family, right? No, she's got great taste. I... I trust her. Well, what does she like? Rose Honeydew. Oh. Is that a color? Mm-mmm. You better control that situation. It's very ongoing. New grass leads to new bushes by the windows, leads to new curtains, leads to new sofa, leads to new carpet, leads to new floor. New baby. Dude, she's pregnant? How far along is she? You know if it's a boy or a girl? No, she's not pregnant. She's just on a weird journey, moving through the house, one room to the next. Sounds expensive. Sounds pregnant. Congratulations. You're fucking late. Sir, I'm good to go. No. You should introduce yourself and tell us something about you we don't know. All right. Petty Officer... Oh, shut up! Get out! Shut the fuck up! Hey. Settle down. Give the kid a chance. Remember what it was like for you. Petty Officer... Who gives a shit! Shut the fuck up! Mr. Patton, please. There we go. More neck. Come on, dude, you got to get into it. Lose yourself. Yeah! Whoa! Whoo! Really, really bad. Dude, that was traumatizing. Can we vote to push him through? Because I can't see that ever again. Hands up. Push him through! I don't know. Can he say it? Can you say it? Prove it! I don't want to watch you dance again. I really don't. Can you say it, Mr. Patton? I can say it, I can say it. Uh... Don't fuck it up. Come on. No more fucking around. Come on. Been around the world twice. Talked to everyone once. Seen two whales fuck. Been to three world fairs. I even know a man in Thailand with a wooden cock. I push more Peter more sweeter and more completer than any other Peter pusher around. I'm a hard-bodied, hairy-chested, rooting tooting shooting, parac' hutting demolition double-cap crimping frogman. There ain't nothing I can't do. No sky too high, no sea too rough, no muff too tough. Learned a lot of lessons in my life. Never shoot a large-caliber man with a small-caliber bullet. Drive all kinds of trucks. Two-bys, four-bys, six-bys. And those big motherfuckers that bend and go, ""ssh-ssh"" when you step on the brakes. Anything in life worth doing is worth overdoing. Moderation is for cowards. I'm a lover, I'm a fighter, I'm a UDT Navy SEAL diver. I'll wine, dine, intertwine, and sneak out the back door when the refueling is done. So if you're feeling froggy, then you better jump, because this frogman's been there, done that and is going back for more. Cheers, boys. She does not need an Arabian horse! How the fuck do you know about that? I know everything, Murphy. More a Tennessee Walker cross stallion. The original Silver. The Lone Ranger's horse. No shit. Glorious horse, Murphy. Glorious! Razor 11, is two Mikes out. Establish over watch at AGL. All right, Commander, approaching the L.Z. One Mike on the deck. One minute! Thirty seconds. Thirty seconds! Roger.

At 0930, we move to high ground and make comms. Marcus, Axe, shut her down. Dietz, you got security. Rest up, gents. Can you get off the radio while you're chewing? You're making me nauseous. Mikey, you see this? What the fuck is this? Oh, shit. Get down! Down! Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Get up. Get your hands back. Spartan Base, Spartan O-1. Stepped right the fuck on me. What the fuck is this? What the fuck? Are you talking to Taliban? Fucking Tali. Saying again. This is Spartan O-1. Over. Come on. Come on. Hey, eyes down. Eyes down. Eyes down. Eyes down. Motherfuck. Axe. Eyes on him, what he does. Fuck. Spartan Base, this is Spartan O-1. Over. Danny, your radio working? So now I'm going to be that guy calling on an unsecured sat line because your shit ain't functioning. Talk to the Mountain, sir. Eyes down. Eyes down. Motherfuck. You know, it's feeling like a cursed op. It's not a cursed op. There's no curses. It's just Afghanistan. That's all. J- Bad TOC, Sergeant Hasslert speaking. Sergeant, this is Spartan O-1. Do you hear me? Hello. Sergeant, this is Spartan O-1. Yes, yes, I can hear you, sir. I am calling on an unsecured line. I need to speak to the C.O. immediately. The C.O.? That's correct. Which C.O., sir? Commander Kristensen. Commander Kristensen isn't here, sir. Ah, he's at Ba-gram. Yes, that's correct, sir. I need you to transfer me to Ba-gram Ouellette TOC. Now. Roger that, sir. Stand by. Ouellette. Petty Officer Patton. Patton, Mike Murphy. You're looking for Mike Murphy? This is Mike Murphy. Do you copy? Mike? This connection sucks. What's up, man? Patton, get me the Skipper now. He's sleeping, sir. Wake him the fuck up. Did you say wake him up, sir? Right fucking now. Roger that. Murph wants me to wake the Skipper. Mike Murphy? Yeah. That's Mike Murphy? Well, go get him. Commander Kristensen? Commander Kristensen? Sir, sorry, sir. I got Lieutenant Murphy on the phone for you in the TOC. He says he needs to talk to you now. Which one? Right there. Mike? Mike? Oh, it dropped. Mike? It's dead. What did he say? Uh, just that he needed to talk to you. Why is Murphy calling on a sat phone? No idea. Are we having comms problems with Spartan O-1? We were good for a while, but we've missed two windows now, sir. Two. Try him back! For fuck's sake. Fuck! Worst fucking comms. Well, we could light the goats on fire, smoke signal our way out of here. Yeah, I could walk down to the village, ask to borrow a phone. You'd get some interesting tile ideas down there, bro. Afghan Dirt Brown, Goat Skin Blond. Shit, she'll dig that a hell of a lot more than, what is it, fucking Honey Cream? Sit down. Sit down! Way I see it, we got three options. One, we let them go, hike up. We'll probably be found in less than an hour. Two, we tie them up, hike out, roll the dice. They'll probably be eaten by fucking wolves, or freeze to death. Three? We terminate the compromise. Shah's down there. We let them go, we're letting him go. Mission fails. No, Mikey. I don't like it. I don't fucking like it at all. What are we gonna do? We gonna kill them? Huh? Okay, we kill them, right? What, then what? Fucking bury 'em? They get found, then what? Then what? What do you mean, then what? And then what? You know then what. What do you think? This shit's gonna be private? Huh? It's gonna be out there for the whole fucking world. CNN, okay? ""Seals kill kids."" That's the fucking story forever. It's nobody's fucking business what we do up here. We do what we do. What we have to do. This is the fucking Navy and you're the fucking boss, so you make the fucking call, sir. Shah killed Marines last week. Twenty. We let him go, more will die next week. Forty more the week after that. Our job is to stop Shah. Why do these men have the right to dictate how we do our job? Rules of Engagement says we cannot touch them. I understand. And I don't care. I care about you. I care about you. I care about you. I care about you. I don't want your mom seeing your head, your decapitated head on Al Jazeera. That is Shah. I don't see it that way. Where do you think he's running to? friends down there. Got guys in Leavenworth doing for taking home trophy guns. What do you think they're gonna do for two fucking kids and an old fucking man? Fucking look at them, man. They fucking hate us. Look, at him. That's not a kid, that's a soldier. That's death. Look at death. We can't do it. Look at that soldier. They are unarmed prisoners. And the second they run down there, we got hajis on our backs. Tie 'em up. Tie 'em up. Let's get the fuck out of here. We can't just fucking leave 'em, let 'em go! I thought you were standing by waiting for your fucking orders? I am standing by waiting for my fucking orders. What do you think that radio's for? They're not calling Domino's Pizza. I know what the fucking radio's for. That radio's fucking Tali. It's a cell phone to the Taliban. So you just think it'll just be our little secret? Huh? That's a warrior. Schwack them. We cannot do that. This is a soft compromise. You want to go to Leavenworth? You don't know how many hajis they have down there, man. Don't let him influence you. Marcus, I'm just saying, you can't just say... Look at that child. Make up your fucking mind and don't let him influence you. Schwack them. Mikey, it's your fucking call. I ain't fucking voting. This is not a vote. This is what we're gonna do. This op is compromised. So we're going to pack up everything. We're gonna cut them loose and we're gonna make this peak. When we make this peak, you're gonna get comms up. When we get these comms up, we're gonna call for extract and we're going home. Roger that, sir. Roger that. Roger. Spartan O-1. Spartan O-1, do you copy? Fisher? Coffee. Spartan O-1, radio check, do you copy? Radio check for Spartan O-1. Radio check. Spartan O-1. Spartan O-1... Spartan O-1, do you copy?

Limited resources, Chief. There ain't enough Apaches. That's fucked up. They'll be back. Hey. Hey. You just won the lottery. Any station, listen up. Please relay to Spartan O-1. Spartan to base, do you copy? Spartan O-1, Spartan O-1 to base, do you copy? Fuck. Oh, fuck! False summit. Fuck! Yeah. Danny, get me some comms. Come on. Spartan Base, this is Spartan O-1. Over. What do you want to do? Go home. Get in bed, watch Anchorman. Yeah, Roger that. What do you think? I think we did the right thing. I think we let our love light shine. Fuck me! I mean, isn't that how things work? Good things happen to good people? This is a bad spot. Danny, I got nothing here on sat. Give me something. I don't have fucking shit. How do you feel? This is a bad spot. You okay? All set. Good. Let's fall back to that tree line. Wait till sundown. If we can't make comms, we're walking home anyways, gents. Let's get some rest. Pack up, let's move. Fuck. Spartan O-1, Spartan to base, do you copy? Spartan O-1, radio check, do you copy? Sir, they've now missed three windows. Okay. Commander Shriver, there's a call for you on line 17. Roger. Commander Shriver. Uh, sir, this is Erik. For your S.A., we have missed three comm windows with Spartan O-1. Last known comms were at 0700. Why am I hearing this from you right now? Sir, we expected to have some comms problems. Murphy and I discussed and agreed that we would not start a spin until after he missed two windows. Is there a fucking problem here, Erik? Sir, I've told you everything I have at this point. I will call you when I have more information. This is Commander Kristensen out. Fuck. I'm going to do some Recon. Be back in two minutes. You want some company? Negative. I'm going to do about two minutes of Recon. Be right back. We're about to get contacted. How fucking fast are these guys? Fast. What are you thinking? I'm thinking we're about getting fixing to get into a pretty good gun fight. Copy that. Looks like I voted wrong. Negative. We just got the opportunity to make hell fucking strong contact with our friend from the other side. Job well done. Hoo-yah to that, sir. Danny, get ready to fight. Hey, Mikey... I'm about ready to punch that time card. Do it. Push left! Marcus, move! Moving! Motherfucker. Spartan Base, this is Spartan O-1. Request immediate QRF! Troops in contact! Fuck! Fuck. Fucking shit!

We're all shot, bro. Can you fight? Messed up my drawing hand, that pisses me off. All right, we're good. We just gotta get to flat ground, then we take these motherfuckers, that's it. Fucking foot!

Mikey, give me the fucking... I'm sorry, Mike. For what? That we haven't killed more of these fuckers. Oh, don't be fucking sorry. We're gonna fucking kill way more of 'em. Fuck! Marcus. Never out of the fight. What's he doing, Marcus? Murphy's moving! Murphy's moving! Where is he going? Oh, fuck! Murphy's moving! Oh, fuck. I am the Reaper. Fuck. Fucking A. Fuck! J- Bad TOC. Sergeant Hasslert. This is Lieutenant Mike Murphy. Spartan O-1. We need immediate air support. We need help. We are heading down the ravine towards the Chichal Village. Roger that, Murphy.

This is fucking unbelievable! No shit! Sir, we are four Mikes out from the zone. Four Mikes! Look alive, gentlemen. Bruno report Mike Bravo plus five. Altimeter 2998. Where's Mike? Where's Murphy? Up top. Where up top? He's getting the QRF. Where exactly is Mike? If I knew exactly where the fuck he was, I would tell you, brother! Is he squared away? Oh, fuck. Let me see you. Oh. Motherfuckers. Did they really shoot me in the fucking head? Yeah, buddy. Are Mikey and Danny really dead? I don't know. Are we dead? Negative. We're good, right? Fuck, yeah. We're solid. If I die, I need you to make sure that Cindy knows how much I love her. She knows. And that I died with my brothers with a full fucking heart. You're not dying, Axe. We're not gonna... We gotta spread out. Get yourself some real estate. 64, be advised. Negative Apache support. LZ is too hot. Stand down. What's the problem? The Apaches were pulled. We're grounded. Why?

23,2006,Perfume: The Story of a Murderer,American,"The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on a redheaded girl (Karoline Herfurth) selling yellow plums, following her and repeatedly attempting to sniff her, but startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her all over, becoming distraught when her scent fades. Afterwards, Grenouille is haunted by the desire to recreate the girl's aroma.
After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to identify and create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to preserve scents. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. Grenouille continues working for Baldini but is saddened when he learns that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects. Baldini informs Grenouille of another method that can be learned in Grasse and agrees to help him by providing the journeyman papers he requires in exchange for 100 new perfume formulas. Right after Grenouille departs, Baldini dies when the shaky building, along with his studio, collapses. En route to Grasse, Grenouille decides to exile himself from society, taking refuge in a cave. During this time, he discovers that he lacks any personal scent himself, and believes this is why he is perceived as strange or disturbing by others. Deciding to continue his quest, he leaves his cave and continues to Grasse.
Upon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of Laura Richis (Rachel Hurd-Wood), the beautiful, redheaded daughter of the wealthy Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman) and decides that she will be his ""thirteenth scent"", the linchpin of his perfume. Grenouille finds a job in Grasse under Madame Arnulfi (Corinna Harfouch) and learns the method of enfleurage. He kills a young lavender picker and attempts to extract her scent using the method of hot enfleurage, which fails. After this, he attempts the method of cold enfleurage on a prostitute he hired, but she becomes alarmed and tries to throw him out. He murders her and successfully preserves the scent of the woman. Grenouille embarks on a killing spree, targeting beautiful young women and capturing their scents using his perfected method. He dumps the women's naked corpses around the city, creating panic. After preserving the first twelve scents, Grenouille plans his attack on Laura. During a church sermon denouncing and excommunicating the murderer, it is announced that a man has confessed to the murders. Richis remains unconvinced and secretly flees the city with his daughter, telling no one their destination. Grenouille tracks her scent to a roadside inn and sneaks into her room that night, murdering her.
Soldiers capture Grenouille moments after he finishes preparing his perfume. On the day of his execution, he applies the perfume on himself, forcing the jailers to release him. The executioner and the crowd in attendance are speechless at the beauty of the perfume; they declare Grenouille innocent before falling into a massive orgy. Richis, still convinced of Grenouille's guilt, threatens him with his sword, but he is then overwhelmed by the scent and embraces Grenouille as his ""son."" Walking out of Grasse unscathed, Grenouille has enough perfume to rule the world, but has discovered that it will not allow him to love or be loved like a normal person. Disenchanted by his aimless quest, he returns to the Parisian fish market where he was born and pours the remaining perfume over his head. Overcome by the scent and in the belief that Grenouille is an angel, the nearby crowd devours him. The next morning, all that is left are his clothes and the empty bottle, from which one final drop of perfume falls.",7.5,tt0396171,"Quick. We can't hold them back much longer. Hurry. - Come on! - Get up! Quick! Faster! Open the doors. Come on, quickly! Just read them the sentence. The sentence of the court is that in two days hence the perfumer journeyman Jean-Baptiste Grenouille shall be bound to a wooden cross with his face raised toward heaven. And whilst still alive be dealt twelve blows with an iron rod breaking the joints of his arms, his shoulders, his hips, his legs. He shall then be raised up to hang until dead and all customary acts of mercy are expressly forbidden the executioner. In 18th-century France, there lived a man who was one of the most gifted and notorious personages of his time. His name was Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, and if his name has been forgotten today, it is for the reason that his ambition was restricted to a domain that leaves no trace in history: To the fleeting realm of scent. In the period of which we speak, there reigned in the cities a stench barely conceivable to us modern men and women. Naturally, the stench was foulest in Paris, for Paris was the largest city in Europe. And nowhere in Paris was that stench more profoundly repugnant than in the city's fish market. Here we are. I'll get another box. It was here, then, on the most putrid spot in the whole kingdom, that Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was born on the 17th of July, 1738. It was his mother's fifth birth. She'd delivered them all here under her fishstand, and all had been stillbirths, or semi-stillbirths, You all right? And the whole mess was shoveled with the fishguts into the river. It would be much the same today but then, Jean-Baptiste chose differently. What's that noise? - It's a baby. - What's going on here? It's a newborn. Where's its mother? She was just here. She tried to kill it. Her own child. She tried to kill her baby! There! There she is! Stop! Stop where you are! Murderer! Thus, the first sound to escape Grenouille's lips sent his mother to the gallows and Jean-Baptiste, by official order, to the orphanage of Madame Gaillard. How many today? Four. Well, three and a half. As usual, more dead than alive. Just take the money and sign. Make room. - Where? - Move! Go on, now. Is it dead? That's not staying in my bed. - Let's throw it out, then. - What if it screams? Let's just kill it. Harder! Push! What are you doing? For Mme Gaillard, Grenouille was a source of income, like any other. The children, however, sensed at once that there was something different about him. By the age of five, Jean-Baptiste still could not talk. But he was born with a talent that made him unique among mankind. It was not that the other children hated him, they felt unnerved by him. Increasingly he became aware that his phenomenal sense of smell was a gift that had been given to him, and him alone. When Jean-Baptiste did finally learn to speak he soon found that everyday language proved inadequate for all the olfactory experiences accumulating within himself. Wood. Warm wood. Grass. Wet grass. Stones. Warm stones. Water. Cold water. Frog. Wet stones. Big, wet frog stones. Something. Something. Something. By 13, Mme Gaillard no longer had room for Jean-Baptiste and therefore decided to sell him. Come on. Ten francs. From his first breath of the odor enveloping this man... Seven, and not one sou more. ... Grenouille knew that his life in Grimal's tannery would be worth precisely as much as the work he could accomplish. Unfortunately for Madame Gaillard, the bargain was short-lived. Life expectancy in the tannery was a mere five years but Jean-Baptiste proved to be as tough as a resilient bacterium. He adjusted to his new fate and became a paragon of docility and diligence. Slaved 15, hours a day, summer and winter. Gradually he became aware of a world beyond the tannery, where a Utopia of unexplored smells lay in store for him. Grenouille! Come with us. I'm taking you to town for delivery. Jean-Baptiste Grenouille had triumphed. He was alive and at last he was in his element. He was not choosy. He did not differentiate between what are good smells from bad, at least not yet. He was very greedy. The goal was to possess everything the world had to offer in odors. His only condition being, that they were new ones. Thousands upon thousands of odors formed an invisible gruel which he dissected into its most remote parts and pieces. Grenouille! Come on! Get your ass over here! He needs two dozen skins by next week. Can you do that? - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah, come with me. What is it called? ""Amor and Psyche"", madame. My latest creation. May I try it? If you'll allow me, mademoiselle. Sheer heaven! Monsieur Pelissier, you are truly an artiste. Please, take them. I've got far too many. What do you want? Want to buy some? Two for a sou. Next time you run off like that, I'll kill you! That night, he could not sleep. The intoxicating power of the girl's scent made it clear to him why he'd come to his own life so tenaciously, so savagely. The purpose of his miserable existence had a higher destiny. He would learn how to preserve scent so that never again would he lose such sublime beauty. There were about a dozen perfumers in Paris in those days. One of them, the once-celebrated Italian perfumer, Giuseppe Baldini, had set up shop in the center of the bridge called Pont au Change on his arrival in Paris over thirty years ago. To be sure, at one time in his youth, Baldini had created several truly great perfumes, to which he owed his fortune. But now Baldini was out of touch, out of fashion, and spent his days waiting for customers that no longer came. - Chénier! There you are! - Monsieur Baldini. Put on your wig. Put on your wig! You going out? I wish to retire to my study for a few hours and do not want to be disturbed under any circumstances. Will you be creating a new perfume, Monsieur Baldini? Correct. For Count Verhamont. He has asked for something like... I think he said it was called Amor and Psyche from that swindler in the Rue Saint André des Arts. Pelissier? Pelissier, that's him. Amor and Psyche! Do you know it? Oh, yes. You can smell it everywhere these days, monsieur. On every street corner. In fact, I just purchased you a sample. In case you wanted to test it. What on earth makes you think I'd be interested in testing it? You're right. It's nothing special. Actually it's a very common scent. I believe the head chord contains lime oil. Really? And the heart chord? Orange blossom, I believe. And civet in the base chord, but, you know, I cannot say for sure. Well, I couldn't care less what that bungler Pelissier - slops into his perfumes. - Naturally not, monsieur. And I am thinking of creating something for Count Verhamont that will cause a veritable sensation. I'm sure it will, Monsieur Baldini. Take charge of the shop, Chénier, and don't let anyone come near me. Inspiration requires peace and tranquility. Is there anything else you need? Inspiration, perhaps. Ah, my Giuseppe. You are still the great perfumer Baldini. Wonderful. He did it again. Lime oil. Orange blossom, to be sure. And a hint of cloves, perhaps. No. Or could be cinnamon? It's gone. Cinnamon. It's not cinnamon. Cloves. No. Musk? No. Who's there? I'm from Grimal's tannery. I've got the goatskins you ordered. Follow me. This way. There. Lay them there. Tell your master that the skins are fine. I'll come by in the next few days and pay for them. Yes, Monsieur. You want to make this leather smell good, don't you? Why, of course and so it shall. With Amor  Psyche by Pelissier? Whatever gave you the absurd idea I would use someone else's perfume? It's all over you. It's on your forehead, your nose, your hands... It's bad, Amor  Psyche is, Master. There's too much rosemary in it. And too much of... that and that. Bergamot and Patchouli? Pat...? Patchouli. Patchouli. What else? That and that. That and that. Orange blossom, lime... - Rosemary. - Musk. And cloves? And this. - Storax? - That's in it too. - Storax. - Storax. You have, it appears, a fine nose, young man. My nose knows all the smells in the world. It's the best nose in Paris, only I don't know the names. I need to learn the names, learn them all... No, no, no! You dont interrupt me when I'm speaking. You are both impertinent and insolent. Even I don't know every scent. I've, of course, known for some time the ingredients of Amor  Psyche. But all it needs to find that out is a passably fine nose, nothing else. But it needs the craft of a true perfumer to detect the exact formula, which notes, which chords, and in what precise measurements. Could you tell me the exact formula of Amor  Psyche? Best-nose-in-Paris! Speak up! You see, you can't. Can you? And I'll tell you why. Because talent means next to nothing, while experience acquired in humility and hard work means everything. I don't know what a formula is, but I can make Amor  Psyche for you now. And you think ljust let you slop around in my laboratory with essential oils that are worth a fortune? You? Yes. Now pay attention! What is your name, anyway? Jean-Baptiste Grenouille. Very well, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, you shall have the opportunity now to prove your assertion. Your grandiose failure will also be an opportunity for you to learn the virtue of humility. - How much do you want me to make? - How much of what...? How much Amor  Psyche do you want? Shall I fill this flask? No! You shall not! You may fill this one. Yes, Master. But, Master Baldini... You must let me do it in my own way. As you please. No! Don't drop it. That's pure alcohol. You want to blow up the building? You have to measure it first! Stop, stop it! That's enough! You know nothing! Essential oils are always to be mixed first, then the alcohol added and never ever is perfume to be shaken like that! I must have been insane to listen to your asinine gibberish! It's all done. This is Amor  Psyche! But it's not a good perfume, Master. If you let me again, Master, I'll make it more better. Now it's a really good perfume. Don't you want to smell it, Master? I'm not in the mood to test it now. I have other things on my mind. Go now. - But, Master... - Go! Now! Can I come to work for you, master? Can I? Let me think about it. Master! I have to learn how to keep smell! What? Can you teach me that? I shall have to think about it. Now, go. I love you. I'll give you francs for him. Grenouille! Grimal's transaction had a profound effect on all three parties. Not least upon Monsieur Grimal himself. As for Giuseppe Baldini, the acquisition of Grenouille miraculously transformed his dwindling business even surpassing its former glory. While at last, for Jean-Baptiste, the mysterious secrets of the perfumer's craft began to unfold. Now, pay careful attention to what I tell you. Just like a musical chord, a perfume chord contains four essences or notes, carefully selected for their harmonic affinity. Each perfume contains three chords: The head, the heart and the base, necessitating twelve notes in all. The head chord contains the first impression, lasting a few minutes before giving way to the heart chord, the theme of the perfume, lasting several hours. Finally, the base chord, the trail of the perfume, lasting several days. Mind you, the ancient Egyptians believed that one can only create a truly original perfume by adding an extra note, one final essence that will ring out and dominate the others. Legend has it that an amphora was once found in a pharaoh's tomb and when it was opened a perfume was released. After all those thousands of years, a perfume of such subtle beauty and yet such power, that for one single moment every person on earth believed they were in paradise. Twelve essences could be identified, but the 13th, the vital one, could never be determined. Why not? Why not? What do you mean, why not? Because it's a legend, numbskull! What's a legend? Never mind. Jean-Baptiste. Jean-Baptiste? What's the matter? Master, I have to learn how to capture scent. What are you talking about? I have to learn how to capture scent and reprise it forever. You mean, preserve. You have to teach me that. All right. Calm down, my boy. Calm down. We have work to do. ""The soul of beings is their scent."" You said that, master. Did I? I will make you as many perfumes as you want but you have to teach me how to capture the smell of all things. Can you do that? Well, naturally. Then teach me everything you know and I'll make you the best perfume in the whole world. Imagine, Jean-Baptiste, ten thousand roses to produce one single ounce of essential oil. Now, keep the air flowing or the bottom petals will begin to stew while I set up the alembic. And take care not to damage them. We have to let them go to their deaths with their scent intact. Perfect. Now, help me with the Moor's head. Temperature is vital. When the quicksilver is here, the heat is precisely correct and the oil will gradually rise. Note this mechanism is a remarkable invention of my own devising. You will observe how cold water is pumped through here allowing the essence to condense here until it finally appears here. Of course, out on the hillside above Grasse we had only to bellow pure, fresh air. Ah, Grasse. What a town. The Rome of scents. The Promised Land of perfume. No man can rightly call himself a perfumer unless he has proved his worth in that hallowed place. Not to worry. Happens all the time. To Grasse. Master. Look. The very soul of the rose. Jean-Baptiste. What's wrong? Jean-Baptiste. What have you done? - You lied. - What? You lied to me. How dare you talk to me like that. You said I could capture the scent of anything. And so you can. What do you smell? What do you smell? Nothing. What were you expecting to smell? Glass. But glass doesn't smell. Course it does. What's this? I don't smell a thing. It should smell like copper! Enough! You were trying to distill the smell of copper? Iron? Glass? Copper? What else did you try? No! Have you gone completely insane? You told me I had to experiment. Experiment? Experiment? But not with the cat. What kind of a human being are you? Don't you know anything? You can no more distill the scent of a cat than you can distill the scent of you or me. I can't? Of course not! He is in stadio ultimo. - What? - He's dying. Is there nothing you can do? - I fear not. - No! He cannot die. Well, my fee is francs. francs? You charlatan! You can't even name the disease! No! Jean-Baptiste! You cannot do this to me. Not now. Not yet. Is there any other way to preserve smell besides distill it? Jean-Baptiste? Is there, master? Well, yes, I believe there is. What is it? It is known as the mysterious art of enfleurage. Can you teach me? Not even I am intimate with its secrets. But could I learn it in Grasse? - Well... - Could I? Where else but in Grasse? Within a week Grenouille was well again, but to travel to Grasse to find ajob he needed journey papers. Baldini agreed to provide them on condition that Grenouille left him not less than one hundred formulas for new perfumes. Grenouille did not mind. He could have given him a thousand. The morning of Grenouille's departure, Baldini was pleased. At last, he felt rewarded for his many years of hard work. He could not remember a happier day. Deeply satisfied, he went back to sleep and awoke no more in this life. With every step he took from the city, the happier he felt. The air above him grew clearer, purer, cleaner, and at last he was able to breathe freely. There were two ways to reach Grasse. The first followed the winding roads through the villages while the second lead across the mountains, down into Provence. The choice was quite easy. Thus his nose led him ever higher, ever further from mankind, more towards the magnetic pole of the greatest possible solitude. Grenouille needed a moment to believe that he had actually found a spot on earth where scent was almost absent. Spread all around lay nothing but the tranquil scent of dead stone. There was something sacred about this place. No longer distracted by anything external, he was finally able to bask in his own existence and found it splendid. After a while, he almost forgot his plans and obsessions and, indeed, might have done so altogether. Hello? Hello? Hello? There were a thousand smells in his clothes. The smell of sand, stone, moss. Even the smell of the sausage he'd eaten weeks ago. Only one smell was not there. His own. For the first time, Grenouille realized he had no smell. He realized that all his life he had been a nobody to everyone. What he now felt was the fear of his own oblivion. It was as though he did not exist. By the first light of next morning, Grenouille had a new plan. He must continue his journey to Grasse. There he would teach the world not only that he existed, that he was someone, but that he was exceptional. And with this decision it seemed that the gods had at last begun to smile on him. Go in. Laura? Laura? Coming, Papa. Haven't seen you here before. It's my first season. Picking together is always more fun. They say you pick everything you find. Idiot! How many times have I told you not to cram the blossoms in like you're stuffing a chicken? Watch how Grenouille does it. Look how skillfully he handles them. The whole art of enfleurage is to allow the flowers to die slowly. In their sleep, as it were. Handle them as you would a lady. Wouldn't you agree with me, Druot? If you say so, Madame. You. Check the jonquil blossoms. They need more time. Do what I say! Stop it! I'm not in the mood. Are you sure? Of course I'm sure. I said... ...no! Suit yourself Lucien? Fetch me back the ladder. Fetch it yourself. Lucien? Lucien! Lucien? Lucien? Lucien? Tuberoses for Madame Arnulfi. She here? She's busy. Seems such a waste to boil them. Or whatever you do with them. So what do you do with them? Warm them in animal fat. - What for? - The fat soaks up their scent. Then what? Then I cool it to a pomade and then I filter it before... Before what? Before I add in alcohol and other essences to make a perfume. Don't touch anything. What's in there? Nothing. Just flowers. - Can I look? - No. Not now. I've got work to do. You must go now. - Come on. Let me look. - Don't touch. Ah, my tuberoses. Morning, Madame. Morning. Why have you covered the tank? It's an experiment, Madame. To protect the blossoms from daylight. To preserve the scent better. Well, if you say so. Come with me. I'll settle your master's account. To preserve their scent better, you say? I don't smell much. No. Then my experiment was a failure. Make sure it's your time you're wasting, not ours. How much must I pay to be with you? Depends what you want. What's that stuff? I'm creating a perfume. Lie down, please. It feels horrible. It's only animal fat. To soak up your scent. Creating a perfume, eh? Admit it. You're getting some sort of bang out of this. Aren't you? I enjoy my work. Hold your arm still. Don't think you're gonna tie me up. Hold out your arm, please. I've come across some strange men in my time... Just relax. Holy Mother, what's that?! Just for scraping off the fat. - Are you mad? - Relax. You'll ruin everything. If you're frightened, you stink. Then your perfume will be spoiled. I've had enough. Here, take your money. Basting me up in all this goo. You think I am a Christmas goose? Get out of here! Quickly, blow them out before the roses melt! - Roses can't melt, Papa! - These ones can. Now I'd like to propose a toast to our guest of honour, his Excellency, the Marquis de Montesquieu. May our trade continue to flourish! I thank you all and would ask of you the honour to be the first to offer my congratulations to your beautiful daughter and present her with a small token of my affection. It's beautiful. I'm overwhelmed, your Grace. ""Your Grace""? I had hoped that we would be on more familiar terms by now. Let's have a game of hide-and-seek! Oh yes! But everyone must play! Let the men catch the women. Albine! Wait! Put me down. Please? Now there's no escape. Game's over, everybody. Laura? Time to go in now. Laura? Albine? Françoise? Laura, have you seen the twins? No, not since the game started. Albine? Françoise? Albine? Françoise? Jacques? Take this way. You two with me. Your Excellency? Through here. Albine! Françoise! I told that cretin ten times to get these ready! Don't keep picking on the boy. I'll kill him, the useless little sewer rat! Grenouille! What are you doing? Why aren't the enfleurage frames... Yes, master? I mean, would you be good enough to prepare the enfleurage frames? Certainly, master. Acurfew? Are you mad? Jasmine can only be picked before dawn. We all know that. This could mean the ruin of our trade. Yours. And yours and yours. Supposing it's your daughter next time. Of course a curfew is necessary, but we also have to catch this man and to do that is to understand how he thinks, what he wants. I should have thought that was obvious. Use your imagination. And if I were to tell you that all except the prostitute went to their graves with their chastity intact? How would you know? The coroner had each girl examined. They were all found to be virgins. Supposing there isn't a next time? If we introduce a curfew we may all go bankrupt for nothing. So we wait until he's killed, what? Six? Seven? Eight? Curfew! Go back to your homes! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! We have to face the fact that our police are helpless in this matter. I suggest that we ask for support from Paris. Paris won't be smarter than we are. We must arrest every Gypsy in Provence. And every beggar. And every man without a wife and family! Listen. We have to put ourselves inside the mind of this man. Each of his victims had an especial beauty. We know he doesn't want their virginity, so it seems to me that it's their beauty itself that he wants. It's almost as if he's trying to gather something. As if his ambitions are those of a collector. A collector? Of what? Their hair? Whatever it is, I fear he won't stop killing until his collection is complete. Monsieur. This man is a demon. A phantom who cannot be fought by human means. Now, I insist that we call upon our bishop to excommunicate him! What good would that do? Have you no faith in the power of our Holy Mother Church? This is not a matter of faith. There's a murderer out there and we must catch him by using our God-given wits! I say until we submit to Mother Church these killings will not cease. Citizens of Grasse, we hereby declare that this murderer, this demon in our midst, has incurred the sentence of excommunication. Not only has this depraved monster robbed us of our daughters, the young and fair blossom of this city, and by his wanton acts has brought our trade, our livelihood, our very existence, to the brink of eternal darkness. We therefore declare that this vile viper, this ignominious carbuncle, this execrable evil in our midst, shall henceforth be solemnly banned from our holy presence, rejected from the communion of Holy Mother Church as a disciple of Satan, slayer of souls. Stand clear! An infected limb, an outsider of the faith a necromancer, a diabolist, a sorcerer and a damned heretic. Oh, God, in Thy most merciful spirit, bring down thunderbolts upon his head and may the Devil make soup of his bones. Amen. My Lord! It's a miracle! He's been caught! He's been caught! My Lord, the fiend has been caught. In the city of Grenoble. He's confessed to everything. He's confessed to everything! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Praise be to God! And we thank Him for listening to our prayers and answering them. Amen. Amen. Just read the report. This cannot possibly be the same man. He confessed to everything. Including the murders in Grasse. Yes. Under torture. Look. Here. He admits to strangling his victims, pulling out their hair and ravaging them. The Grasse girls were killed by a blow to the back of their heads their hair was carefully cropped, and not one of them was violated. Antoine, we're all happy it's over. Let it go. - Papa, what's the matter? - We're going home. Now! But why? I'm enjoying myself. - Don't argue with me, Laura. - Stop it! I'm going... Laura! Laura! Out of my way! Laura! Laura! Papa! I'm so sorry. I know you must think me a very foolish man, but try to understand you're all I have left. You don't need to explain, Papa. - If anything were to happen to you... - I know. But you must stop worrying about me all the time. Sweet dreams, my love. Sweet dreams, Papa. Laura! Papa, what's the matter? Did you open the window? No. Why? Have this letter dispatched to the Marquis de Montesquieu immediately. Stay on the road north into the mountains. Did Monsieur Richis leave? He did. Which way? North. You sure it wasn't south? I saw them with my own eyes. Why do you want to know? I said north. North! Grenouille! Grenouille! Grenouille! Grenouille! Good God! Good afternoon, Monsieur. Good afternoon. Do you have anyone else staying here? No, Monsieur. Then I would like to take all your rooms for the night. It will be our pleasure, Monsieur. And tomorrow, at first light, we wish to be ferried to the lle de Lérin. - It's deserted, just a few monks. - I'm aware of that. Very well, Monsieur. Our finest room, Mademoiselle. With a superb view of the sea. One moment. Very well. Do you have a room next to this one? - Yes, but the view is different. - I have no interest in the view. Papa, will you please tell me now what is happening? You haven't said a word all day. Why all this secrecy? Last night I dreamt you were dead, murdered like all the other girls. The truth is, I'm convinced that the killer is still here somewhere. All of his victims were young and beautiful, and who is there more beautiful than you, Laura? Whatever his insane scheme, it will surely be incomplete without you. I wrote to the Marquis accepting his proposal of marriage and requesting that it take place as soon as possible. Until then you will stay in the safety of the monastery. And all this because you had a bad dream? - I've made my decision. - But I don't know if I love him! I'm afraid the circumstances leave us no choice. - Papa! - It's all arranged, Laura. On your feet. Hands in the air! Why did you kill my daughter? Why? I needed her. Why did you kill my daughter? I just... needed her. Very well. But remember this. I will be looking at you when you are laid on the cross and the twelve blows are crashing down on your limbs. And when the crowd has finally tired of your screams and wandered home, I will climb up through your blood and sit beside you. I will look deep into your eyes and drop by drop I will trickle my disgust into them like burning acid, until finally you perish. Unchain the prisoner. That's enough. Let him be brought to the scaffold. What's that? He's over there. This man is innocent! He is innocent! An angel! This is no man! This is an angel! Grenouille! You can't fool me! Forgive me, my son. The people of Grasse awoke to a terrible hangover. For many of them, the experience was so ghastly, so completely inexplicable and incompatible with their morals that they literally erased it from their memories. The town council was in session by the afternoon and an order was passed to the police lieutenant to immediately begin fresh investigations into the murders. The following day, Dominique Druot was arrested. It was in his back yard that they found the hair of the victims. After fourteen hours of torture, Druot confessed to everything. With that, the case was closed. By then, Grenouille was already half way back to Paris. He had enough perfume left to enslave the world if he so chose. He could walk to Versailles and have the King kiss his feet. He could write the Pope a letter, reveal himself as the new Messiah. He could do all this and more if he wanted to. He possessed a power stronger than the power of money, or terror, or death. The invincible power to command the love of mankind. There was only one thing the perfume could not do: It could not turn him into a person who could love and be loved like everyone else. So, to hell with it, he thought. To hell with the world, with the perfume, with himself. On the 25th of June, 1766, around o'clock at night, Grenouille entered the city through the Port d'Orleans and like a sleep-walker, his olfactory memories drew him back to where he was born. An angel! I love you! Within no time, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille had disappeared from the face of the earth. When they had finished, they felt a virginal glow of happiness. Forthe first time in their lives they believed that they had done something purely out of love. - Ey, over here! - Look! Look, a jacket! Let's take them all home."
24,2001,Antitrust,American,"Working with his three friends at their new software development company Skullbocks, Stanford graduate Milo Hoffman is contacted by CEO Gary Winston of NURV (Never Underestimate Radical Vision) for a very attractive programming position: a fat paycheck, an almost-unrestrained working environment, and extensive creative control over his work. Accepting Winston's offer, Hoffman and his girlfriend, Alice Poulson, move to NURV headquarters in Portland, Oregon.
Despite development of the flagship product (Synapse, a worldwide media distribution network) being well on schedule, Hoffman soon becomes suspicious of the excellent source code Winston personally provides to him, seemingly when needed most, while refusing to divulge the code's origin.
After his best friend, Teddy Chin, is murdered, Hoffman discovers that NURV is stealing the code they need from programmers around the world—including Chin—and then killing them to cover their tracks. Hoffman learns that not only does NURV employ an extensive surveillance system to observe and steal code, the company has infiltrated the Justice Department and most of the mainstream media. Even his girlfriend is a plant, an ex-con hired by the company to manipulate him.
While searching through a secret NURV database containing surveillance dossiers on employees, he finds that the company has information of a very personal nature about a friend and co-worker, Lisa Calighan. When he reveals to her that the company has this information, she agrees to help him expose NURV's crimes to the world. Coordinating with Brian Bissel, one of Hoffman's friends from his old startup, they plan to use a local public-access television station to hijack Synapse and broadcast their charges against NURV to the world. However, Calighan turns out to be a double agent, foils Hoffman's plan, and turns him over to Winston.
Hoffman had already confronted Poulson and convinced her to side with him against Winston and NURV. When it becomes clear that Hoffman has not succeeded, a backup plan is put into motion by Poulson, the fourth member of Skullbocks, and the incorruptible internal security firm hired by NURV. As Winston prepares to kill Hoffman, the second team successfully usurps one of NURV's own work centers—""Building 21""—and transmits the incriminating evidence as well as the Synapse code. Calighan, Winston and his entourage are publicly arrested for their crimes. After parting ways with the redeemed Poulson, Hoffman rejoins Skullbocks.",6.1,tt0218817,"This business is a living organism Multiplying constantly surrounded by predators There's no rule for idle time or second guessing, New discovery are made hourly. New ideas are ready to be devored and redefined. This business is binary you are a one or a zero, alive or dead AntiTrust There is no second place. It has been suggested by the median congress.. that you're violating antitrust laws and threatening competition Mr. Winston, Can you reasonably deny that you have a monopoly in this area ? Well, the only monopoly... we have at N.U.R.V, is monopoly on excellence. It is still a free market. But a free market encourages competition You prevent it You don't need to remind you the essence of competition is always been quite simple, Any kid working in a garage anywhere in the world with a good idea can put us out of business Let's try a communication scheme if you have a good driver.. Move, move Teddy, I think I have found our bottle neck You did it ! Yee-Haw!! God! That feels good Gorgeous! We're geeks Three months from today, N.U.R.V will launch Synapes transforming the way humans communicate, With Synaps, the entire world will be able to send or receive any message be in audio, video or text on any medium any medium, any medium, ... SYNAPSE will fully unite the global village. You set yourself real ticking clock here, Gary All of your competitor are desperate to get to the market place with this technology before you. It has even been suggested that you won't hit this very ambitious launch date We're going to hit that date, you can bet on it How can you be sure? We'll do whatever it takes to get there Pace yourself, Brian It can go here Milo, what do you think of this? I know I promise my mom we're gonna make this garage famous but I really don't think we're gonna be here that long 'Cause Ive got us appointment with the venture capitalists Oh, that is fantastic I can stop taking calls from those corporate recruitment, losers I'll do the talking, Brian Guys, what are these? Don't you know the worse you look, the smarter they think you are They are going to think you're a genius, Brian I just have Milo and Ted, and the wallets flew open, They were dying to give me their money. You guys are the greatest duo, since Hewlett and Packard Lenon and McCartney Ben and Jerry Ha Ha Ha I'm Lennon, okay Teddy Does that make me Yoko? Look Alice, you got to make him do the start up with Teddy and me Larry, if he wants to go and take a few interviews check out his options as his friend I think you should support him in that What to know the best way to manipulate somebody Yeah Don't try As graduating students of the Standford University, Science department, you have a magnificent foundation in theory what you need is a creative innovative... A monopolist Exactly the guy knows how to get peoples attention Shut up, shut up, shut up I'm trying to listen ! who will fill your questions? Thanks for taking the time to check us out I look forward to seeing some of you up here at the NURV campus, in the near future Questions, cool I got a question for him, alright?

Garry Winston Ha, that would be funny I just spoke to Garry Winston? I can't believe you are not going to take that ticket Give it to me! You don't want to work there, Brian They squeeze everybody out of business, they get bigger and fatter That's why I want to work there You sure he didn't ask for my number? Milo, we can't go up there They don't even know the meaning of open source You know this, we have talked about this They just want to own everything They clone stuff, they reverse engineering it I, I know.  Everybody is stuck with their inferior proprietary version They are being investigated by the justice department for christs sake Tell him, Harry I think that he should go up there and check it out if he is curious You do? Sure, I mean it's your life I need another beer So, you couldn't convince your friend Teddy to come home No, he is pretty tight with his folks You know we can move them up here same goes for yours My parents are dead I'm sorry man So how far is the campus? We're not going to campus. All I can say is it's unfortunate, we offered a lot of money. A substantial amount of money, Gary, no sell Can we buy into their stock? Or is that a justice department problem too? There is no stock, Randy I mean there's no company Garry Winston's office May I help you? Thanks for holding. Yes, he is in a conference right now. Can I take a message? The cold, hard facts are that anything is possible. Anything, anything you're just not thinking creatively. I have every confidence that you can do that, Phil. - This is difficult one but we're gonna prevail - Alright, alright Garry Winston's office Let me check that for you I'm sorry, I don't see anything here Milo Hi.. not every day we have genius in the house - Want a soda pop or something? - No, thanks Come on in Digital canvas The house knows the paintings I like, knows my favorite music, same for anybody else that's in the system There's a little sensor that defects who's in the room Doesn't Bill Gates have something like that? Bill who? ha, ha. ah, no, no. his is primitive. So I understand you are thinking of doing a start up Yeah. My friends and I have been planning on doing a media delivery system for a long time It would be open source, we offer it free to everybody, just charge for tech support. Wow, free. It's a cut-throat business we're in Milo It's just a matter of time before someone borrows your technology, improves it and makes a billion dollars on it. What would you do with a billion dollars Milo? Mmm, I don't know I'll tell you what you could do You could take that money and put it back into technology, education, the arts You can transform culture I founded opera companies, symphony orchestras, museums, theatres, .. I have donated thousands of computers to schools through out the country The question really is, How many of the people you share discoveries with will be outulistic? and how many will make fortunes of your generosity? Come on in here Check this out. huh - This is the SYNAPSE satellite. - You bet. I have of these up there different orbital patterns, satellites, mother satellite of each ring passes over us every night at o'clock to allow for station keeping, re-programming, etc. They in turn pass the data along to the sister satellites in their realm That's the coolest I ever seen. I'm total wrapped up in this It's like Ive got my mission control right here on my PC Activation codes, IP address, flight pass.. - It's the best train set ever, hum? - You bet We've loaded a back door to receive SYNAPSE transmissions and all of our OS software for the past years, We've developed compression schemes and file formats that achieve connectivity, but.. We have a problem You know what that problem is? Ah, your adaptors can't overcome the band width limitation of wireless hand helds That's right Data takes too long to download so your image get's.. Image, ah, goes fuzzy - Fussy, yeah, - Ha ha Can you get this done in time to meet your date? With you, I can So I understand your friend Teddy is kind of attached to his parents. It's very commendable Ah, the truth is he's ah.. Milo, I know, he thinks we're cloned too many programs an forced people to buy our inferior versions and blah, blah, blah.. add infinite item and nauseousm I've heard it all before. I even understand it, it's the nature of competitive business. When you're on top people attack the quality of your product. It comes with the territory So when the attacks get personal that Gary Winston is satan web sites, digitising my wife's face on porn star bodies I don't like that You're one of maybe twenty programmers in the world with the mastery it going to take to finish this thing We'd love for you to join us The future holds limitless possibilities, Milo You decide what the future holds for you. Let me know You know I look at you and see something I haven't seen in years - What? - I see me! - Alice - Umm, So when is Brian coming from the T.V? I don't know I'm going to leave you two alone, o.k? Why are you doing this? Teddy, come on He can't hit his date without you, can he? Remember that lecture Ginnings gave? about open source Yeah He said human knowledge belongs to the world Like Shakespeare or Asprin Teddy, I know you are disappointed, I just feel like this is the right thing to do for now, They were interested in you too, Gary even mentioned you Yeah, well.. I'm not interested in them That's fine. I get what's important to you This is important to me. And I know your are going to get your venture capital We did, We had to settle for 850, because we lost you So, it will be enough.

Department of Justice - Sorry about the glass - No problem How are you, Milo. I am here as a friend I understand you signed up with Gary Winston You know Milo, we're at a great disadvantage with NURV I mean our experts are not as smart as theirs The truth is we could do with a real smart guy on our team to help pick our fights Ha, Im going to take a real shot in the dark here, O.K? I can offer you 42,000 a year and a Buick if you change your mind and join us.

Well, at the time, they indicated that it wouldn't be a problem But they have a bureaucratic mind set, Gary they.. They do? I count on you to solve problems, whatever it takes show me some creativity Gary, we're talking about the law It's not like making software, There are limits --; No limits! Stop thinking like a lawyer for a second and show me some kind of creativity Yes, Sir. He'll have to get back to you Gary Winston's office You can go on in, Milo Gary Winston's office. Yes, he is in a conference right now, May I take a message? Gary - You wanted to see me? - Yeah, Take a look This is amazing. Who's doing all this?

Gary gave me a new compression scheme today I said "" Who's doing all this "", cause I was impressed I wanted to know where it was coming from Right ? He just lost it, like... he was, he shouted at me, he had this look in his eyes, like.. How horrible! Yeah - But where did it come from? - I don't know That's what Ive been asking myself I asked around. Nobody knows anything about it, uh. You know, so does he have some genius stored away somewhere? And if does, why not let him write SYNAPSE? - I not saying if makes any sense... - Hey! Honey Sesame Seeds. Jesus. Excuse me... Could you take that away, thank you - I'm so stupid - Hey! He is a genius. Don't forget. If anybody other than you could write this thing as quickly as you're saying wouldn't it maybe be him? - Yes, yes, you are right, The guy's a genius, SYNAPSE is all he cares about and Im being over sensitive for a change To geniuses You know what? Sometimes it helps to get out of here. Just for an hour or so. Hey, Milo Brain Just dropped off my resume, Nearly got in the door. You're living up here now? I'm systems administrator at the load public access station, Where any whack Job with bucks gets his own show. God is it suck. Can you help me? - Put it the word - I'll see what I can do. Yeah - Well, Im parked illegally - Ok. They pushed up all the schedules on the SYNAPSE's applications How fast you go? There is no second place. Plus every time I get jammed up. Gary comes up with something. Did uh... Gary give you a new design or something? - Yeah I must have offended him, 'cause he a... he yelled at me. People don't ever just, like, hand you stuff Maybe once. I reconfigured it anyway. You're compulsive. Moments, precious moments that you want to hold that you want to share, at home, at school, at work. You'll keep in touch with the one's you love through SYNAPSE the first satellite delivered global communications system Share live voices, music, pictures or video, data or text, with anyone, anywhere, instantly... Look, Daddy SYNAPSE links every communication device on the planet. Because every moment matters. I think you do - Hi, honey - Hi I didn't expect ..ah.. Uh.. Lisa this is my... this is Alice.. Lisa is doing the user interfaces for SYNAPSE. - Oh Hi Milo tells me you are a really great artist Oh, yeah he always exaggerates. Well um, I got a lot to do.. it was nice to meet you. How are you? I'm so surprised - Are you ok? Is everything alright? - Yeah yeah. No. I just wanted to come out and you know. ..see what these faces like. - It's really good to see you. - Yeah. What did the girl say? There maybe a little less trust after you snapped at him - It hasn't effected his work though. - Nothing does. It's pretty amazing. What's wrong? Teddy's been killed. They've done this before. Just never killed anybody until now. But it's their writing on the wall Their hate literature was scattered everywhere They hold MO, it's like they were asking to be caught. And they've been arrested twice for beating up Asians. How come they weren't in jail? People told us to be careful in this neighborhood. I guess he didn't take them too seriously. Yeah. well. that's our problem. We don't take anything seriously, do we? It's not on the hard drive. Hey, I didn't know you guys were working with fiber optics. We're just a bounch of crazy assholes. And he was on the verge of something. He was right there. He was going to show us the next day. He told me, I should get the VC to line up appointment with a bunch of companies. You know. He said, the answer is not in the box. It's in the band. - You know I called him last week to uh... 'cause... - I know. He was happy you did. Be strong, Larry Milo. - May I join you? - Yeah Heard about what happened. - I'm very sorry. - Thanks Had you talked to him... much, lately? Just once. Things weren't that great between us and we couldn't talk about work because it was off limits. Did you have something you wanted to show me? - Look. we can save it for another day. - No, it's okay. I.. it will help take my mind off things. Really - Yeah. yeah - Okay. Well, I haven't been able to sleep all week. Thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And then it just came to me. It's in the wrong place. - The wrong place. - Yeah The answer is not in the box. It's in the band. It's in the band. It's in the band. Hey, are you sure you're alright? I think I ate something, I gotta go. Alice! Teddy was on to something very specific, now he is dead. There's got to be a connection, Alice, I can feel it. So what are you saying? You think they have something to do with Teddy's death I don't know what I am saying, all I know is all these ideas keep flying in. He says that any kid working in his garage could put him out of business, It's almost like they know what every kid is doing. They're hacking into people's computers. I guess they can get into some people's machines, but, not ..not Teddys. He always had the most paranoid firewalls to protect his data. They'd have to been like watching him physically Watching him physically. Oh shit I think it is part of a camera Number isn't just a broadcast studio. It's a surveillance post or something. That's why they have those disks on the roof. Milo, think about that you're saying, You honestly think that he would murder somebody? I don't know, I gotta get in there There's over buildings over there, and they all filled with computers No no no, this is the only one with disks on the roof The studios a front, That's why they keep postponing the opening. Ok, now you're scaring me. Do you wanna just go? 'Cause we can go, you wanna just... leave Go where, go where Alice? You can't get away from people like this! People like this. This is Gary you are talking about You don't think I know that? They're under investigation by the Justice Department I mean, you said yourself that there are guys showing up all the time. Then how could they possibly hope on hiding a surveillance force, How could they hope on hiding anything, You can't get in there anyway, they have swipe cards, they have cameras, I mean it's like Fort Knox for christ sakes I'm implicated, Im implicated Alice No, you're not - Yes, I am. - No, you're not - No Yes, who's been using this code, huh? Teddy's code. Whoever code this is. I have, how do you think that makes me feel? This is my best friend, You need to calm down, now - I can't just walk away from this - Yeah, but you can't just walk in either. - You're right - Yeah You're right Uh.. the construction is finished by or 7, the parking lot is cleared by or in the morning. Even the earliest geeks don't get is till 5. Honey, what are you talking about? What, what are you saying right now? Listen to me, I thinking about how I gotta get in there and find out what the hell is going on. Okay but was it true or was it true, did you ever really notice, you're just sounding like a mad man. I won't pretend like everything is okay, Alice that's how I got into this mess I, just tell like.. Alice listen, listen, I'm not, I don't mean to, Im not mad at you, listen to me, I think I can figure out a way to get in there. But I can't do it on my own, so I need you to help me. What am I to do ? So you believe me? Just tell me what to do. Whoa, whoa , whoa, Whoa, Sir, you got to use your own. Where's your ID? I caught him tailgating. Building 20. These cards are your own responsibility - There was an explosion in the closet in buiding - What? Hey, you can't wander around without ID, just park your ass in that chair Well, what can I tell ya ? It's pretty basic operation guide You got your time clock, fuse goes in here you just hook it in the switch over here So, what we got here Bob? Some glorified cherry bomb, some geeks' idea of fun. I've been saying we need a camera in this hall To protect what, the mops? somebody is pulling the chain again Bob. Unless it's a diversion, Milo Hoffman is in my office. - He was tailgating - Bob. Milo is not just another geek He is very important to Gary, So let's not go there, all right? Okay, we'll see you later Is everything okay, Bob? - Hey! - Hi Gary - Working kinda late, huh? - Yeah , uh.. - Can I take a look ? - Yeah - Oh, thats nice. That's excellent. - Thanks. You seem kinda jumpy, Milo. No. I'm just a.... I'm a little surprised to see you out here, now. Well, I like to sneak in late at night sometimes to see who the obsessive ones are Don't work too late. I got my eye on you - How's it going? - Big night switched from tea to coffee. Brought new meaning to my work. Well, now he knows. Nothing in there. - Maybe he'll get back to work now. - Yeah, copy that. - Speaking of which. - Okay. I'm on my way back. - Did you download code San Jose. - Oh shit. I'll do it. - Shame we can't just walk in the front door. - Yeah, wouldn't Bob love that. Ooh! Jesus Yes, I gonna need a thorough background check. I want to know every organization he's been involved with, church groups, all.. - Ahh, Mr. Barton? - Yes Excuse me, uh.. do you remember me? Meelo, isn't it? - Milo - Milo I really need to talk to you Sir, like.. Right, uh.. give me a few seconds with Lasy here you can go into my office I won't be late but a moment - Milo Hey! uh.. Yeah! Thank you for seeing me, Sir - No problem, have a seat - Im ok. You look a little upset I am Sir, I am What's the problem, son Ah..well, my friend, my best friend Teddy He was killed in Silicon Valley and I..I thought maybe there is some way l could help find the suspects - You mean Teddy Chan - Yes, Sir Well, I guess you didn't see the oclock news last night San Jose police picked up a suspect and they're holding them without bail That's great. That's um.. I hope I'll sleep better tonight Well um, Im a little disappointed I thought that you decided to join our side. No Sir, no, Im a real happy there at NURV. but um.. Thank you and thank you for your time. - So he didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department? - No You're not losing your hold on him, are you, Rebecca? Don't forget your part of the deal. You got a very good thing going here. Phill, he'll tell me when he gets back. Well, that will be the test, won't it? Prick It's l0 oclock, Ive been so worried about you What did you see in there? - Nothing. - Nothing? It's exactly what they said it is, an unfinished broadcast studio You know, I think Ive been putting my own guilt on Gary Guilt? Yeah. If Ive done the start up, Maybe Teddy would still be alive. Or maybe you would be dead, too. Anyway, I figure instead of evolving all these paranoid delusions and scaring you I should do something useful with my grief. So I went to see that guy Barton at the DOJ. Do you remember him? Yeah I wanted to see if I could help him find Teddy's killers and it turns out they got the guys last night so.. I have been so worried about you You were right to let him break into He felt pretty foolish afterwards He said it was all to do with his own guilt you know. Not being there. No doing the start up I mean his best friend was just killed. You're convinced he is completely focused on SYNAPSE again. - He's not acting? - No he is pretty honest with his feelings I don't think he knows how to act. Alright? Good. That's all for now. Lisa, I had to tell someone. They know everything about everybody. There're stealing code from all over the place. And sometimes, if someone gets ahead of them, like Teddy - It's all undetectable. - What? The crimes are hand tailored. These guys are in the information business. It's a Chinese guy, frame a local racist. Plus, Im sure Gary has maximum deniability. He tells his people, surprise me, solve the problem, defy me, they turn around and tell the next person the same things. That sounds crazy why would he put himself on the line like that? SYNAPSE SYNAPSE SYNAPSE SYNAPSE the guy has invested billions on getting there first. He will do anything to get his date He has to.... Lisa, they killed my best friend Maybe others I'm living with someone they pay to sleep with me - we have to do something - Like what, what could we possibly do I don't know yet. But we are one step ahead of them they don't know Ive been in the Daycare center, Just 21. They let me do that. That's all they know though. Lisa Lisa! I'm sorry, Milo Alright? I'm sorry Lisa, I know why you won't let anyone near you. I know what he did to you If you leave now, you could be in danger They would use my step father They could frame him if they had too, yeah. What about the FBI? Too risky I went to the DOJ, but they got a guy on payroll over there, maybe others. Who knows who there're paying? Well, who can we trust? I mean how do you let go of a secret without telling the wrong person? I don't know We tell everybody at once See, that way there is no secret left to protect. If everybody knows, they can't touch us. Right What about minutes? CBS news is partnered with NURV information system in a cable news network due to launch Fall of June,2001 AOL-Time Warner has a 40 stake in Gary's setup device and it also takes out CNN.. Disney Join NURV's adventure ABC is out Look, any of these places could a more or all of them - Wait - What? How close are you to finishing SYNAPSE? He's got all the satellites up. There's dishes on top of 21. He's building this mega network just for SYNAPSE. We can connect to everybody on every device simultaneously. That's what SYNAPSE is That's what we'll use ... Got him. So what's in the Daycare Center is a top of raw material that's all over the place What I need you to do is design some kind of a graphic format so people could follow what there're seeing No problem - Shit - What? I would have to get into Gary's house to get the satellite address. He's running the whole thing from his work phone. You mean break in? I don't know, I don't know... And what if the dishes on top of aren't hot yet the place isn't even finished. I'll go up You're not afraid? testing.. UPLINK ACTIVE..

Those who don't innovate are doomed to die doomed to die. to die. to die. doomed to die.

Surrounded by predators. Those who don't innovate Those who don't innovate are doomed to die There is no second place Consumers don't care where new ideas come from just so long as they are offered at a competitive price anywhere in the World anywhere in the World with a good idea can put us out of business Alive or dead We do have a monopoly here at NURV. There's no second place You're a one or a zero, alive or dead Are you insane? What do you think you're doing? I'm letting people know what you've been doing Phil, where is this signal coming from?

I'm most shocked and upset by this betrayal. I will do everything in my power to co-operate with the authorities and bring these criminals to Justice. News that the FBI agent have arrested NURV CEO Gray Winston, TV's, cell phones and PC's were interrupted world wide last night by a huge broadcast initiated by programmer Milo Hoffmann. Police have also arrested these other members of Winstons team at a Portland airfield as they attempted to board a private jet. Justice officials reacted swiftly.. Man, Clinton testimony didn't get this many hits This is, this is awesome I mean there is requests a second, Brain. We did this! I'm surprised this isn't blowing the server Wow, Whoa get over here Come here, Come here Already over million people have downloaded the source code for SYNAPSE from the Skullbox website. Now Skullbox is thought to have originated right here in this Palo Alto garage - Hi there, I just have a couple of questions for you - Is Milo Hoffmann going to testify Do you know where he is now? How many hits have you guy's registered? What's your relationship to Milo Hoffmann? - Good luck - Okay Milo It wasn't all false I Know Bye Do you consider this an ultraman victory for open source Excuse me We did it partner Are you going to testify? Winston always said that any kid in a garage could put him out of business, is that what you've done Milo? This is a garage Hey, there he is. Just now getting word that, yes, yes here he is, here is Gary Winston being led by US marshals to the federal court in Portland.... Milo, when did you first realize Gary Winston's stealing code What is it exactly that you think you have done Milo? And what does it all mean? It means we've given SYNAPSE back to the people it was stolen from. Human knowledge belongs to the world Can we get a picture of the Skullbox team?"
25,2003,My Boss's Daughter,American,"Tom Stansfield (Ashton Kutcher) is a researcher at a publishing company who works under the tyrannical Jack Taylor (Terence Stamp). Tom has a crush on his boss' daughter, Lisa (Tara Reid), who is completely controlled by her overprotective father. She reveals to Tom that her father is making her to house-sit on the same night as a party she wants to attend, but Tom convinces her to stand up to her father and attend the party anyway. Lisa asks him to come to their house that night, leading Tom to think that she has invited him to the party; in reality, she just wants him to fill in for her - he reluctantly agrees.
A comedy of errors ensues, including the return of Lisa's older brother, Red, on the run from drug dealers. Red dumps drugs into the toilet, and instead returns a bag of flour to the drug dealer. One of Tom's tasks is to guard their owl, O-J, which lives in an open cage (it has not been able to fly due to a deep depression, from the loss of a prior mate). When the bird drinks from the toilet polluted with drugs, it flies away. Jack's ex-secretary Audrey goes to the house to try to earn her job back. After fighting with her boyfriend, she stays over at the house.
Lisa returns home after finding out that her boyfriend Hans is cheating on her. Tom hides from her everything that happened and she spends some time with him thinking he is homosexual. He clarifies to her that he's actually straight and she starts to like him. Audrey's friend thinks she has breast cancer and asks Tom to feel her breasts. Lisa walks in on them and is disgusted by the situation.
T.J., the drug dealer, finds out about the fake drugs and threatens to kill Tom if he doesn't return his money. T.J. tries to open a safe and steal the money. However, Tom gives him sleeping pills mixed with alcohol which sends him into a coma. Because they think T.J. is dead, Audrey and her friends bury him. Later, T.J. escapes from the grave and threatens to kill Lisa. With Red's help, Tom rescues Lisa and she falls in love with him. He then goes to get her father, but on the way back the owl gets into the car making Tom lose control of the car and crash into the house. They find police officers in the house looking for T.J., who ends up getting arrested. Jack is enraged by the damages done to the house and throws Tom out. The next day, Jack hears his son explaining to Lisa how she should stand up to their father and go back to Tom. Jack realizes his mistakes and gives Tom a promotion.",4.7,tt0270980,".

Oh, l,,, l don't-l don't really know much about the limitations of the handicapped, l know of an employment agency that hires out retarded people for 4 an hour, So, if making a cup of coffee is too difficult a task for you, Miss Bennett, perhaps you'd be good enough to let me know, and l'll contact this agency and give a retarded person a job, mouths Wow, - l wasn't too rough on her, was l? - Well, she is new and all, Maybe l was out of line, But do you understand what l'm dealing with? l mean, here l am trying to fill a position in Creative, and l can't seem to find one person responsible enough to earn my trust, l sometimes wonder if anyone here even knows what they're doing, l can understand how you could see it that way, sir, but,,, So you don't think l was out of line?

Just one, The other is inserted into his rectum, Don't worry, lt's not too unpleasant for him, - He doesn't bite, does he? - No, Not unless you taunt him, You're not planning on taunting him, are you, Tom? - No, - l mean, that'd be really sick, No, of course not, And the most important thing, make sure he gets a pint of water, The medication tends to dry him out and then he can't breathe, - OK, - Well, l must be off, - Henderson should be waiting outside, - Henderson? l thought you fired him, Because his ideas were stupid? Of course not, He's gonna drive me to the train station, So, you can leave as soon as Lisa and Hans get back, - Hans? - Lisa's boyfriend, So remember, uh,,, water in the bowl, medication, and,,, anything happens to this house while l'm gone, l'll kill you, door shuts Paul over phone You're housesitting?

27,2006,Fifty Pills,American,"After being blamed for a party which he didn't throw or have any knowledge of, that resulted in many damages, young Darren (Lou Taylor Pucci) loses his scholarship. Being from a lower-middle-class family he will not have enough money to pay for college next semester without his scholarship. His roommate, Coleman (John Hensley), who actually threw the party, sympathizes with Darren and gives him a stash of fifty ecstasy pills. If he sells the pills he could make $1000 and would have enough money to stay in school.
Darren sells to many weirdos, including a dominatrix who wants the pills so her ""pets"" can be numb when she has sex with them. When visiting his girlfriend, her roommate sets Darren up with a connection. The brother of this roommate is a seemingly retarded and overly-zealous white-collar employee named Ralphie (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is obsessed with Diff'rent Strokes. He makes Darren watch four hours of the show, but Darren leaves. Upon leaving he is harassed by a drug dealer known as The Seoul Man (Ron Yuan), who almost kills him. Once again his luck turns sour when his girlfriend finds out that he is selling drugs and breaks it off with him.
Coleman owes money to a drug dealer, so a group of three armed thugs are sent to extract the money for him at his dorm. Not having the money, he says he will call Darren and they can take whatever pills he has left as collateral. Darren comes back to the dorm, and gives the pills to the thugs, who leave. The next day, Darren feels defeated, but discovers that Coleman paid his tuition in full and is leaving the college. Reinvigorated, Darren begins dating Gracie and the movie ends with the two sitting on a bench with Darren taking a picture on his phone, saying that Gracie is about to make his parents very happy.",4.9,tt0426462,"Hi. I hate myself. Leave a message. Darren, you dumb son of a bitch, stop wallowing in self pity and wake up. Christ. All right, look. I'm already on my way to Philly for the weekend. Lindsays being a bitch about something. Someone told her I banged her older sister, which I did. But it was while we broke up for that week in September. I don't know why shes so pissed about it. But anyway, I gotta head down there before she goes ballistic on me. But, um, back to my point. I Hi. I hate myself. Leave a message. Darren, you dipshit. I know you're still sleeping. So wake up. I found a way for your ass to stay in school. Okay, man look. I felt kinda bad about the whole thing with the alcohol violation, and your scholarship. You're the one that threw the party, you asshole. I'm the one that threw the party, and I'm the asshole. I know. So I guess you could say this is my way of making it up to you. Okay? Now look on my desk. There are pills of ecstasy, and one of my pagers. Now you have to remember there's no voicemail on that one so the numbers are gonna come straight through, okay? Look, exams are over, my man, and you know are gonna wanna get down  What the fuck are you talking about, Coleman? I cant do this. Sure you can. - I am not like you. I'm not a fucking drug dealer. What are you thinking, man? Are you crazy? - Darren, you'll do fine. But, uh, no, this - No. No buts. I am gonna fucking get arrested. Look, man. Its only one day, and no ones gonna notice you. I have to turn in a paper on Dantes Inferno today. Look, man, uh, I gotta go. You're, you're breakin up here really bad. Listen hang in there, buddy, bye. No, don't you fucking hang up this... Coleman! Coleman, I cant do this. I'm not gonna do this. Fuck! Holy shit. I hate you, Coleman! FIFTY PILLS NEW YORK CITY FOUR MONTHS EARLIER COLEMAN My first year at college. Its about damn time. Thats what you're supposed to say, right? Within minutes, I met my new roommate, Coleman. From the first time I saw him, I knew Id never met anybody like him. Yo, yo, Green Day. What the fuck, does this look like my bathroom? What are you gonna do next, take a shit on my bed? - Yo, man, sorry. Yeah, don't be sorry, just fix it. Its simple. Hey, whats up, man, I'm Coleman. I didnt know if I wanted to know anybody like him. It made me wonder why his parents sent movers instead of coming by themselves. Mine, mine wanted to. Just they really couldnt take the time off of work. Do well, son. First time away from home? - Yeah. I went to camp, though, once. You ever had international phone sex? - What? Wait, hold that thought. Uh, do you smoke? Hell yeah, I'm from North Carolina, come on. I grew up on these things. Thats okay. Enjoy. You cant imagine how rad it is to get off while talking to some chick on another continent whos getting off, and sometimes in a language that you don't even speak. Kicks ass. I was impressed. It was either at that moment or somewhere near it that Coleman became my new personal hero. Its like this. If you act like the fuckin man and you think you're the fuckin man, then nothing is gonna make that other schmuck lookin up to you think that you're not the fuckin man. Everything in life involves a little creativity. It literally took Coleman about five minutes No, no, no, no, no. Four minutes, seconds, please. Four minutes, seconds to realize that we had to have a moving in party. The best way to have a good party is To fucking advertise. New York, I'm here, bitches! Apparently, summer internships at his fathers multimillion dollar PR firm really paid off. Yeah, you know thats what I'm packin. Dude. - What? Did they pretend they don't like it? They fuckin love it. You know, I doubt it. Why do you think they come here? Same reason you did. To learn? Yeah, welcome. Okay, everybody, lets go, partys over, come on. Make sure you take cabs. - I know. Stupid. Really stupid. This is when I realized that Coleman should be no ones personal hero. See, what we failed to realize was that if we write about the party on every whiteboard in the dorm, the RAs are gonna see it too. Darren Giles. Welcome to college. Yeah, I think were gonna have to write you guys up. No, you don't have to - Check, check, three checks. Thats a lotta checks. - You guys are like a couple of Germans. I don't even know what that means. You see, what happened is we invited this guy that lives on our hall to come over and hang out, and it just got outrageous. I don't know what happened. Could this have had anything to do with it? You're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy, so get your ass down to room tonight and meet the real Tin Man? Well, he - he looks happy. And how about this? - That? That belongs to Coleman. Christ, I made that thing with some friends in high school. Its for show. I drink out of glasses. I would never use something like that. You and your roommate are going on probation On probation? - Probation. What do you wanna do next? You wanna put a collar around my nutsack? Yes, sir? - Felicia, bring a collar for his nutsack. And you goin on probation today. You goin on probation as of two minutes after you leave here. And if you try it, if you have a little one, if you have a little tiny drink, you are goin to lose that scholarship, you are going to lose your financial aid, and I will personally make sure that you never go to another university for the rest of your life. From the second day of my college existence, I had one strike against me. So, now all we had to do was be good. And we were good. Good at not getting caught again. Believe it or not, I was actually looking forward to Thanksgiving break with my parents. Clean sheets, toilet paper, a refrigerator. With food in it. Doreen, you have outdone yourself with that stuffing. Fantastic. Son, your mother and I have something wed like to tell you. Yeah. No need to be alarmed whats the best way to put this? I don't know, the best way to put it is that were going through a few changes. Yeah, were, uh - You're not pregnant, are you? No. No, no. I should be so lucky, huh? - What the hell does that mean? Harold, its been four months, and if it werent for Mr. Red upstairs, Id probably have lost my mind. Damn, Mom, thatsdisgusting! Were eating. - Don't say damn to your mother. And you don't have to bring up our intimate times in front of the boy. Well, honey, a little companionship in that department would be very nice. I can't believe this. - Im gonna go upstairs. I'm allergic to the Viagra. - What? Yeah, uh, it makes me sweat, and gives me wet shits. Oh, I am sorry. I mental images are. Honey, that was the kielbasa. - You sit down. Its not the kielbasa. We had to sent that carpet to the cleaners. It cost a fortune. Sit. Talk. Son, I have something very important I wanna tell you. Don't you wanna hear it? - Fine. Son, your fathers been laid off. They're replacing me with a damned laptop computer. Windows 98, or some foul thing. I'm sorry, Dad. Thats - thats really screwed up. No, its fucked up, is what it is. Lets, you know, call a spade a spade. I - I have to get that. What was with you bringing up our sex life in front of him? Hello? - Mr. Darren. How did I know it would be you? GRACIE - Gracie was at the party we threw that first night. For some reason, she was talking to me. Jesus Christ. Oh my God. It wasnt longer than the whiteboard. Oh, I don't know, I didnt see. I didnt mean to. All right, heres to new beginnings, and all that shit. I need a refill, though. Well, maybe next time. Definitely. That Gracie chick is hot, man. You should tap it. Dude, she just broke up with her boyfriend like two days ago. I don't really think she was ready to jump into another relationship. Whos talking about a relationship? I'm just saying shes got the hot ass, is all. All right. I'm goin to bed. Mr. Darren. - How did I know it would be you? Having fun in the bible belt? Does hearing about your parents sex life constitute as fun? I would think no. - Yeah, I agree. Do you, like, when I get back, do you wanna go have dinner or something? Invitation accepted. Yeah, 'cause we, you know, we could bring, like, friends and stuff like that. We could, you know, go in a group or somethin. Okay, sure. Id better get going. Michelles interpretive dance show is about to start. I... okay. - Good night, Darren. Bye, see you. Greasy, greasy, greasy. Greasy? I was just curious. Shit. Bumpin uglies is not appropriate dinner conversation. Honey, hes very upset. Why don't you have a talk with him? I think hes upset because you have a talk. You have the rapport with him. Why don't you establish a rapport with him and have a relationship with somebody in this family, huh? - Go on, go on. Fine. Ill talk to him. - Womans job to talk to her son. Honey? Darren? Sweetie? You know, Dad and I didnt mean to scare you. Honey? Sweetie, we just, well, Id really rather talk to you face to face. Can I come in? - Yeah. Okay. Mom! God! Oh my God. You're gay! Close the door! It has nothing to do with your sex life or me not wanting to be here. I just have to get home and protect my room. - Son, son, be honest with me. Do you have a boyfriend that you're going back to New York to see? Do you? Its okay you. - I am not gay! Whats wrong with you? Shh, keep it down. Put the window down. Put it down. Oh, honey. - Come on, come on, now. Don't leave us like this. You know, I looked it up on the Internet last night. Its okay to be gay. Its almost natural. Honey, why don't you just stay a couple more days? We can work this out, son. Ill go to a gay bar with you. One step at a time. Honey, if you have a special friend, you can bring him home. Well hang a gay flag in the front of the house. Honey, we understand these things. - Yeah, we do. We saw Philadelphia. - We loved it! All I wanted to do was get home, have a few beers, and party with my friends. But they werent there. Coleman wasnt even there. Then, I saw why. Apparently, Coleman had thrown a party while I was away, and guess what? It got busted. Now you would think that because I wasnt there, I wouldnt be in trouble, right? No. A bottle of vodka in my refrigerator made it my responsibility and my problem. I was fucked. My scholarship was gone, and without that money, I couldnt even register for classes next semester. So here I am, a thousand dollars short, hours to pay it, pills of ecstasy, and I'm actually contemplating doing this. THE DAY BEGINS Hey. - Hey. Good morning to you, too. Its D day. - I know. Sorry. God, youve really cleaned this place out. Yeah, I'm just, you know, scraping at the bottom of the barrel now. Theres nothing left. But I'm, you know, I could ask my parents, its just that they don't have it. And my grandparents, I already tapped them out, so. Hey, whats up, Darren? Uh, you still wanna do that deal, dude? Yeah. Yeah. Deal? Ten bucks, right, dude? Yeah, you got it, man. Thanks. I fuckin love David Duchovny. What? - Nothing. I just... What? - Nothing. Don't worry about it. I just thought Coleman might be rubbing off on you a little bit too much for your own good. Oh, no. Thats funny. God, I cant imagine this place without you. Is that weird? Well, lets not go getting all sentimental. I have to run an errand with Michelle. But Ill see you for the Christmas fundraiser? Hell yeah, definitely. I will be there. Okay. Ill be there until 9:00, but dress warm, 'cause its gonna be cold out. You're not gonna believe this, but I just sold my jacket. Okay. Ill bring blankets. - Okay. Okay. Hey, don't worry about this stuff. Okay? You'll figure something out. 'Cause you're good at this sort of thing. Yeah. Hi. Hi, sir. Good morning, Darren. - Something I can help you with? I got a call from the finance department. I think you know what they had to say. I know. I mean, um, what, what am I supposed to do? You know, cant you help, or? I wasnt here when they got written up. You know that. My hands are tied. Its policy. And if I could do something, I... you're a good kid. I wish I could help. I'm sorry. No, sir, theres nothing you can do. Look. Ill hold off on filing the move order until Monday. But if you don't get this straightened out with them by then, security will enforce your removal from the building, you understand me? Yeah. Yeah, thank you. Wish there was more I could do. Yeah, me too. Hey. Did somebody just page me? I heard you, uh, got some real kickin shit. How much is a pill? Uh, 20. Twenty, uh, I mean, um Oh, 20, well, okay, sounds cool, sounds cool. All right, let me talk to my boys real quick. Okay, but you know what? Maybe you should - just call back later. EDUARDO Its a university number, yo. Yeah, man, what did you say this cockfaced man was again? Coleman, man, like the cooler. Why you so pissed at this guy, Ed? - I can't tell you, man. Man, but you expect us to go over there and bust up this college prick, but you cant tell us why. - Its embarrassing, V. Man, we can't justify crippling some dude on a whim. Yeah, Little Steves just not that kinda guy. - Yeah. - Right. I was at Vinyl, right? And I see some super sharp lookin motherfucka, right? But he sells cocaine, okay?

And don't be using my shit to prove your point. Whatever. - Its something I came up with a few years back. You know, its like a philosophy. You know, its kind of like a force.

He dropped out of BC three years ago, after he inherited his trust when he turned 21. And then he won the lottery like a week later. I would have dropped out too. No, see, thats the thing. He didnt win, like, the big lottery. He just won, like, scratch off tickets that he cashed out for 7,000. But he said it was a sign from God. Anyways, now hes just a lonely Internet trader. Like you'll be someday. - Thanks, Pothead. You should call him, probably, maybe. Don't tell Gracie about this, kay? Just, I kinda wanna keep her out of it. Sure. - Thank you. Oh, please, no more.

No, its, like, scientifically proven and stuff. Scientifically? - Do you have any documentation on that one? No, but I bet I could find some, smart guy.

I don't know what I'm gonna do next semester. I don't even know what I'm gonna do tomorrow. I just know that I made a mistake, and that you're hurt because of it. And I am so sorry for that. Well, what are you gonna do to make it up to me? So. Here you go. Good? Excellent. Okay. Wait. Okay. What is this for again? Lets just say itll make my parents really proud. Smile. - Thanks."
28,2010,Shutter Island,American,"In 1954, U.S. Marshals Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island in Boston Harbor. They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, who was incarcerated for drowning her three children. Their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in Solando's room: ""The law of 4; who is 67?"" They arrive just before a storm hits, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days.
Daniels and Aule find the staff confrontational. Dr. John Cawley, the lead psychiatrist, refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solando's doctor Lester Sheehan left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. They are given access to the hospital, but they are told that Ward C is off limits and that the lighthouse has already been searched. While being interviewed, one patient secretly writes the word ""RUN"" in Daniels' notepad. Daniels starts to have migraine headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and experiences waking visions of his involvement in the Dachau liberation reprisals. He has disturbing dreams of his wife Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by a local arsonist named Andrew Laeddis. In one instance, she tells him that Solando is still on the island somewhere—as is Laeddis, who everyone claims was never there to begin with. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was an ulterior personal motive for taking the case.
During their investigation, Daniels and Aule find that Solando has abruptly resurfaced with no explanation as to her former whereabouts or how she escaped. This prompts Daniels to break into the restricted Ward C. There he encounters George Noyce, a patient in solitary confinement. Noyce warns him that the doctors are performing questionable experiments on the patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be lobotomized. Noyce warns Daniels that everyone else on the island is playing an elaborate game specifically designed for Daniels—including his partner Aule.
Daniels regroups with Aule and is determined to investigate the lighthouse. They become separated while climbing the cliffs toward it, and Daniels later sees what he believes to be Aule's body on the rocks below. By the time he climbs down, however, the body has disappeared, but he finds a cave where he discovers a woman in hiding who claims to be the real Rachel Solando. She states that she is a former psychiatrist at the hospital who discovered the experiments with psychotropic medication and trans-orbital lobotomy in an attempt to develop mind control techniques. Before she could report her findings to the authorities, however, she was forcibly committed to Ashecliffe as a patient. Daniels returns to the hospital, but finds no evidence of Aule ever being there.
Daniels is convinced that Aule was taken to the lighthouse; he breaks into it only to discover Cawley calmly waiting there for him. Cawley explains that Daniels is actually Andrew Laeddis, their ""most dangerous patient"" incarcerated in Ward C for murdering his manic depressive wife Dolores Chanal after she drowned their children. Edward Daniels and Rachel Solando are anagrams of Andrew Laeddis and Dolores Chanal; furthermore, the little girl from Laeddis' recurring dreams is his daughter Rachel.
According to Cawley, the events of the past several days have been designed to break Laeddis' conspiracy-laden insanity by allowing him to play out the role of Daniels. The hospital staff were part of the test, including Dr. Sheehan posing as Aule and a nurse posing as Rachel Solando. The migraines that Laeddis suffered were withdrawal symptoms from his medication, as were the hallucinations of the ""real Rachel Solando"". Overwhelmed, Laeddis faints.
Laeddis awakens in the hospital under watch of Cawley and Sheehan. When questioned, he tells the truth in a coherent manner, which satisfies the doctors as a sign of progression. Nevertheless, Cawley notes that they had achieved this state nine months before but Laeddis had quickly regressed, and further warns that this will be his last chance to redeem himself.
Some time later, Laeddis relaxes on the hospital grounds with Dr. Sheehan, but he calls him ""Chuck"" and says that they need to leave the island. Sheehan shakes his head to an observing Cawley, who gestures to the orderlies towards Laeddis. Laeddis asks Dr. Sheehan if it is worse to live as a monster or die as a good man, and is then led away by the orderlies.",8.2,tt1130884,"Pull yourself together! It's just water. It's a lot of water. Come on. - You okay boss? - Yeah, I'm fine. I just... I just can't I just can't stomach the water. - So you're my new partner? - That's right. Not the best way to meet with my head halfway down the toilet. Doesn't exactly square with Teddy Daniels: The man. The legend. I'll give you that. The Legend? What the hell are you boys smoking out there in Portland anyway? Seattle. I came from the office in Seattle. How long have you been with Marshals? Four years. - So you know how small it is? - Sure What about you? You got a girl? Married? I was. She died. - Jesus... I didn't... - Don't worry about it. There was a fire in our apartment building while I was at work Four People died. It was the smoke that got her not the fire. So... - So that's important. - I'm sorry Boss. Where are my goddamn cigarettes? Well here. Have one of mine. I could of sworn they were in my jacket when I got on. Government employees will rob you blind. Thanks. They give you a briefing about the institution before you left? All I know is it's a mental hospital. For the criminally insane. Well, if it was just folks running around, hearing voices, and chasing after butterflies, they wouldn't need us. - That's where we're headed? - Yup. The other side of the island is rock bluffs all the way down to the edge of the water. The dock, it's the only way on...or off. We will be casting off as soon as you two are ashore. I'd appreciate if you'd hurry up about it. - Why? - Storm's coming. I've never seen a marshal's badge before. I'm Deputy Warden McPherson, gentlemen. Welcome to Shutter Island. I'll be the one taking you up to Ashecliffe. Your boys seem a little on edge Mr. McPherson. Right now, Marshal. We all are. ""Remember us for we too have lived, loved and laughed"" Electrified perimeter. How could you tell? I've seen something like it before. All right. You gentlemen will be accorded all the help we can give. But during the stay you will obey protocol. Is that understood? Absolutely. The red brick bulding on my right is ward A, the male ward. Ward B, the female ward, is the one on the left. Ward C is that building on the bluffs. An old civil war fort. The most dangerous patients are housed there. Admittance to ward C is forbidden without the written consent and physical presence of both myself and Dr. Cawly. Is that understood? You act like insanity is catching. You are hereby required to surrending your firearms. Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed federal marshals. We are required to carry our firearms with us at all times. Executive order of the Federal Code of Penitentiaries states that: when inside the penitentiary the offices of that institution have final authority. Gentlemen, you will not get through this gate with your firearms. Okay. Now that the official stuff is done, come on boys. What do you say we go find Dr. Cawley? So when did she escape? This prisoner? I'm afraid that Dr. Cawley will have to fill you in on the situation. Protocol. Correctional officers at a mental institution. That's a weird sight, if you don't mind me saying It's the only facility of it's kind in the U.S. Even in the world. We take only the most dangerous, damaged patients. Ones no other hospital can manage. And it's all due to Dr. Cawley. He's created something really unique here. A hospital for people our society normally... ID's, gentlemen. Show your badges, gentlemen. Dr. Cawley's been consulted numerous times - By Scotland Yard, MI5, the OSS... - Why? What do you mean? What do the intelligence agencies want to consult a psychatrist about? I guess you'll have to ask him. - Marshal Daniels. - Doctor. Marshal Aule. - Thank you deputy warden, that will be all. - Yes, sir. Pleasure, gentlemen. He had a lot to say about you. McPherson is a good man. He believes in the work we do here. And what would that be exactly? A moral fusion between law and order and clinical care. Pardon me Doc... a what between what and what? Those paintings are quite accurate. It used to be that the kind of patients we deal with here were shackled and left in their own filth. They were beaten. As if whipping them bloody would drive the psychosis out. We drove screws into their brains. We submerged them in icy water until they lost consciousness. Or even drown. - And now? - We treat them. Try to heal, try to cure. And if this fails, at least we provide them with a measure of comfort in their lives. Calm. These are... all violent offenders, right? They've hurt people. - Murdered them in some cases. - In almost all cases. Yes. Then personally Doctor, I'd have to say... screw their sense of calm. It's my job to treat my patients not their victims. I'm not here to judge. - So this female prisoner... - Patient. Excuse me, patient. One Rachel Solando, - Escaped sometime in the last hours. - Last night. Between and midnight. - Is she considered dangerous? - You could say that. She killed all three of her children. She drowned them in the lake behind her house. She took them out one by one and held their heads under until they died. Then she brought them back inside and arranged them around the kitchen table. She ate a meal there before a neighbor dropped by. And what about the husband? He died. On the beaches of Normandy. She is a war widow. She starved herself when first she came here. She insisted the children weren't dead. - Sorry doctor. You wouldn't happen to have an aspirin? Do you? - Prone to headaches marshal. Sometimes, but today... - I'm a little more prone to seasickness. - Ah, Dehydration... - You alright boss? - Yes. In that case you're quite right. The simpler the better. Thank you so much. Rachel still believes her children are alive. She also believes this place is her home in the Berckshires. You're kidding me. She's never once in two years acknowledged that she is in an institution. She believes we're all... deliveryman, milkman, postal workers. To sustain the illusion that her children never died, she's created an elaborate fictional structure. She gives us all parts to play in that fiction. - So have you searched the grounds yet? - The warden and his men scoured the island, not a trace. What's more disturbing is, we don't know how she got out of her room. It was locked from the outside and the only window is barred. It's as if she evaporated straight through the walls. Brought her right back here after group therapy, locked her in I came back for a midnight round and she was gone. Seriously doctor, how is it possible that the truth never gets through to her? I mean, she's in a mental institution, right? Seems like something you'd notice from time to time. - How many pairs of shoes are the patients given? - Two pairs. Sanity is not a choice, marshal, You can't just choose to get over it. So... she left here barefoot? Come on Doc, she couldn't get ten yards in that terrain. Marshal? Well this is definitely Rachel's handwriting. - I have no idea what the ""law of 4"" is, though. - It's not a psychiatric term? I'm afraid not. Who's 67? Fuck if I know! I'd have to say that's quite close to my clinical conclusion. So you think it's random scribblings? Oh no, not at all. Rachel is smart. Brilliant in fact. - This paper could be important. - Excuse me Doctor, but... - We're gonna have to hold onto this. - Of course. And you say she had to come through here. After lights out, the orderlies play cards in here. Last night there were men sitting at the base of those stairs playing stud poker. Yet somehow, Rachel managed to slip past them. Why? How? She turns invisible? Doctor, we're gonna need access to personnel files of all the medical staff. The nurses, the guards, the orderlies. - Anyone who was working then. - We'll take your request under consideration. This is not a request, Doctor. This is a federal facility and a dangerous prisoner... - Patient. - Patient... - has escaped now. You will comply... - All I can say is that I will see what I can do. Doctor, we're gonna need to speak with the staff, do you understand? I'll assemble them in the common room after dinner. If you have any further questions feel free to join the deputy warden in the search. It's miles to the nearest land and the water is freezing. The current was strong last night. The tide pushing in. She'd have drowned or been crushed on the rocks, and her body would have washed back up onshore. What about those caves down there, have you checked them? No way she could get there. The base of those cliffs are covered in poison ivy, live oak, sumac and a thousand plants with thorns as big as my dick. You said it yourself marshal, she's got no shoes. All right! Let's check the other side! - What's that tower? - It's an old lighthouse. The guards already searched inside it. - What's in there? More patients? - Sewage treatment facility. It's getting dark soon. I'm calling this off for the night. Let's go, boys! - You were on watch on the landing, huh? - Yeah. Can't nobody get in or out of their room in that corridor without me seeing. Okay, Rachel Solando, who else does she have to pass to get down here? Me. Glen Miga. - Sir, I didn't see nothing. - And you were at your post all night? Yes. But I didn't see a thing. Glen. Glen. Tell me the truth. I maybe... went to the bathroom. - What? You breached protocol? Christ... - I wasn't gone more than a minute. All right, let's back up here. Let's all just back up. Miss Solando was put in her room for lights out. Does anybody here know what she did before that? Anyone? Come on. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. She was in a group therapy session. Huh. Did anything unusual occur? Define ""unusual"". - Excuse me. - It's a mental institution, marshal. For criminally insane. ""Usual"", isn't a big part of our day. I will rephrase. Did anything happen last night during group therapy, that was more... - let's say, more memorable than... - Normal? Exactly! No. I'm sorry. Did Mrs. Solando say anything during group therapy? She was worried about the rain. And she hated the food here. Complained constantly. Last night included. So... you were there. Was there a doctor present? Yes. Dr. Sheehan led the discussion. Dr. Sheehan? Yes. He was running the session. He's Rachels's ""primary"". The psychaiatrist who directly oversees her care. We're gonna need to speak with Dr. Sheehan. I'm afraid that won't be possible. He left on the ferry this morning. His vacation was already planned. He'd putting it off too long. You're in a state of lockdown. A dangerous patient has escaped and you let her primary doctor leave on vacation? Of course, he's a doctor. Do you have the phone number for where he's gone? Hello? Hello? Hello? Is anybody there? I'm sorry sir, but its all down. All the lines. The storm's hitting the mainland like a hammer. If you get it working, come find me immediately. The marshalls need to make an important call. Yes, sir. I'm afraid I have evening rounds in the wards, But I'll be having drinks and a cigar at my house around If you'd care to drop by Good, we can talk then, right? We have been talking, marshal. Gotta say, I'm thinking I got into the wrong line of public service. It is a little overwhelming. it was constructed during the civil war The same time as the military fort housing ward C. This is the original commander's quarters and Uncle Sam got the bill. The commander was court-martialed. I can see why. Nice music. Who is that? Brahms? No. It's Mahler. Quite right, marshal. Forgive me, gentlemen... My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring. ""Quartet for Piano and Strings in A minor"" - Your poison, gentlemen? - Rye, if you've got it. Soda and ice please, thanks. You don't indulge in alcohol? I am surprised. Isn't it common for men in your profession to imbibe? Common enough. And yours? - I'm sorry? - Your profession, doctor. Psychiatry... I've always heard it was overrun with boozers and drunks. Not that I've noticed. What's that? Iced tea in your glass there? Excellent marshal. You have outstanding defense mechanisms. You must be quite adept at interrogations, hmm? Men like you... are my specialty. You know? Men of violence. That's a hell of an assumption to make... No assumption. Not at all. You misunderstand me, I said you are men of violence I'm not accusing you of being violent men. That's quite different. Please, please, edify us, doctor. You both served overseas. Not much of a stretch, Doc. For all you know, we were both paper pushers over there No, you were not. Since the schoolyard, neither of you has ever walked away from a physical conflict. Not because you enjoy it, but because retreat wasn't something you considered an option. We weren't raised to run, Doc. Ah, yes... Raised. and who raised you, marshal? Me? Wolves. Very impressive defense mechanisms. Do you believe in God, marshal? I'm quite serious. That's rubbish. Have you ever seen... a death camp, doctor? In German I have, I was there, for the liberation of Dakau. Your English is very good, almost flawless. His English is very good. You hit the consonants a tad hard, though. You're German? - Is legal immigration a crime, marshal? - Oh I don't know doctor, you to tell us. Now listen, we're gonne need those files on Sheehan and the rest of staff as well. No personnel files will be released for you. Period. - We're gonna need those files. - Out of the question. Bullshit, out of the question! Bullshit! Who the hell is in charge here anyway, huh? Dr. Naehring acts as liaison to our board of overseers. He relayed your request and it's been refused. Refused? They don't have the authority to refuse. And neither do you, sir. Marshal, continue your investigation and we will do all we can to help. This investigation is over. We're gonna file our reports and hand it over to... - Hoover's boys. - Hoover's boys, that's right. We'll be taking the ferry back in the morning. Come on, Chuck. Nice night. You'll be bunking in the orderlies quarter. Hey boss?... We really packing it in? Why? I guess, I dunno, I just... never really quit anything before. We haven't heard the truth once yet, Chuck. Listen. Rachel Solando did not slip out of a locked cell barefoot without any help. I think she had alot of help. Maybe Cawley's sitting up in his mansion right now, rethinking his whole attitude. - Maybe in the morning... - You're bluffing? I didn't say that. I found a whole stack of these, Teddy. Jesus, are you ever sober anymore? I killed alot of people in the war. Is that why you drink? Are you real? No. She's still here. Who? Rachel? She never left. Remember when we stayed in the cabin in the summer, Teddy? We were so happy. She's here. You can't leave. I'm not gonna leave. I love you so much. - I'm just bones in a box, Teddy. - No. I am. You have to wake up. I won't go. You're here. I'm not. You have to face that. But she is. And so is he. Who? Laeddis. I have to go. No! Please...just let me hold you. - Just a little bit longer. - Oh, Teddy... You have to let me go. I can't. Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit. Doctor. Doctor, doctor. We need to interview the patients who were in Rachel's group therapy session. I thought your investigation was finished? It's not like we can take the ferry. Now was Rachel receiving any other treatment for her illnesses? Do you know the state of the mental health field these days, gentlemen? No. Not a clue doctor. War. The old school believes in surgical intervention. Psychosurgery. Procedures like the trans-orbital lobotomy. Some say the patients become reasonable, docile. Others say they become zombies. - And the new school? - Psycho pharmacology. A new drug has just been approved. Authority. Which relaxes psychotic patients. You could say it tames them. - And which school are you in, Doc? - Me? I have this radical idea that if you treat a patient with respect, listen to him, try and understand. you just might reach him. - These patients? - Even these. What should be a last resort is becoming a first response. Give them a pill, put them in a corner, and it all goes away. Rachel Solando was on a combination of drugs meant to keep her from becoming violent, but it was only intermittently effective. The greatest obstacle to her recovery was her refusal to face what she had done. ""Was."" Is there a reason you keep referring to your patient in the past tense, doctor? Look outside, marshal. Why do you think? Next up is Peter Breen. Assaulted his father's nurse with a broken glass. Nurse survived, but her face permaanently disfigured. I can't wait. She'd smiles at me. She was so sweet. But... I could see it in her eyes. She liked to be naked. To suck cock. Okay, Mr. Breen. And then she asked me if she can have a glass of water? Alone in the kitchen? Like that's no big deal? - Why was that a big deal? - It was obvious. She wanted me to pull out my thing so she could laugh at it. Mr. Breen, we need to ask you some questions, okay? When I cut her she screamed But... She scared me. What did she expect? Interesting. But we are here to talk Rachel Solando, okay? Rachel Solando... Did you know she had drowned her own kids? She drowned her kids! This is a sick fucking world we live in. I'll tell you that... You know what? They should be gassed. All of them... the retards, the killers the niggers. You kill your own kid? Gas the bitch! Would you... stop that? - A nurse? - Please. Stop that. A nurse maybe. Maybe she had kids, huh? A husband... Just trying to make ends meet, to lead a normal life... And it says in your file that uh... You tore her face off, didn't you? Congratulations, no more normal for her, not ever again, no. Do you know what she was afraid of? You. Could you stop that, please?! Stop that! Please... stop! You know a patient by the name of Andrew Laeddis? - I want to go back. - Take him! I'll never get out of here. I'm not sure that I should. Excuse me for saying this, - Miss Kearns... - Misses. Mrs. Kearns. But you seem... quite normal,... I mean in comparison with the other patients here. Well, I have my dark days I suppose everybody does. The difference is that most people don't kill their husbands with an axe. Although personally I think if a man beats you and fucks half the women he sees and no one will help you, axing him isn't the least understandable thing you can do. Maybe you shouldn't get out. And what would I do if I did? I don't know the world anymore. They say there are bombs that can reduce whole cities to ash And what do they call ""televisions""... voices and faces coming from a box. I hear enough voices already What can you tell us about Rachel? Um. Not much, she... she keeps to herself. She believed her kids were alive. She thought she was still living in the Berkshire and we were all neighbours - The milkman, postmen... - Deliveryman, And Dr. Sheehan was there that night? Yes. Um. He talked about anger. Tell me about him... What's he like? I think he's uh... Okay... nice. Not hard on the eyes as my mother would say. Did he ever make a pass at you? No. No, Dr. Sheehan is a good doctor, he would never... Could I have a glass of water, please? No problem. Thank you, marshal. I have just one more question for you Mrs. Kearns. Did you ever meet a patient named Andrew Laeddis? No. Never heard of him. She was coached. She used practically the same words as Cawley and the nurse. - It's like she'd been told exactly what to say. - Who is Andrew Laeddis? You asked every one of those patients back there about him. Who is he? What the hell, boss, I'm your partner for the Christ sake! We just met, Chuck. Been on the beat a long time. You got a duty, got a career and what I'm doing, not exactly by the book. I don't give a damn about ""by the book"", boss I just to know what the hell is going on. When this case came over the wires, - I requested it specifically. Do you understand? - Why? Andrew Laeddis, was the maintenance man in the apartment building where my wife and I lived. Okay. He was also a firebug. Andrew Laeddis lit the match, that caused the fire that killed my wife. Let 'em out! What happened to Laeddis? Got away with it. Laeddis got away with it and disappeared. About a year ago, I opened up the newspaper and there he is. He's an ugly looking son of a bitch. He had a new scar from his right temple down to his left lip. Eyes different colors. Not the type of face you forget. He'd burned down a schoolhouse. Killed people. He said voices told him to do it. First he was sent to prison and then he was transferred here. - Then what? - Then, nothing. He vanished like he never existed. No record whatsoever. I'm sure he's not in ward B that leaves ward C. Or he could be dead. So could Rachel Solando for that matter. Lot of places to hide a body here. Only one place no one really knows. That patient, Bridget Kearne, when she sent me for water, she said something to you back there, didn't she? No. Come on boss! She wrote it. Boss! We gotta get indoors. It's turning into fucking Kansas out here... - All right. - Now. Let's go! Watch out! Jesus! Come on! Let's go back! Jesus Christ! Damn it! - Are you okay boss? - Yes. That's all right. So... if Laeddis is here... What are you going to do boss? I'm not here to kill Leaddis. If it was my wife I'd kill him twice. When we got through the gates of Dakau, the SS guards surrendered. The commandante tried to kill himself before we got there... but he botched it. Took him an hour to die. When I went outside, I saw all the bodies on the ground. Too many to count. Too many to imagine. So yeah The guards surrendered, we took their guns, we lined them up... It wasn't warfare, it was murder. Yeah I've had enough of killing. That's not why I'm here. So what is this all about? After Laeddis vanished, I started doing some checking on Ashecliffe. A lot of people knew about this place, but no one wants to talk... You know? It's like they're scared of something You know this place is funded by a special grant from the House of Unamerican Activities Committee. HUAC. And how exactly are we fighting the Commies from an island in Boston Harbor? By conducting experiments on the mind. At least that's my guess. And you think thats going on in here? Like I said, no one would talk, right? Until I found someone who used to be a patient here. Guy's name is George Noyce. Nice college kid. Socialist. He gets offered some money for some psych study. Guess what they were testing? - Drug tests. - So he starts seeing dragons everywhere. Almost beats his proffesor to death Ends up here in Ashecliffe. Ward C. They released him after year, right? What does he do? Two weeks on the mainland he walks into a bar and stabs three men to death. His lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce... stands up in the courtroom and he begs the judge, for the electric chair. Anywhere but not a mental hospital. Judge gives him life in the Dedham prison. - And you found him? - Yes, I found him. He's a mess But it is pretty clear from what he tells me, they're experimenting on people here. I don't know, boss. - How do you believe a crazy guy? - That's the beauty of it. Crazy people are a perfect subject. They talk, but nobody listens. I stood in Dakau. We saw what human beings are capable of doing to each other, right? For Christ sake we fought a goddamn war to stop them, and now find out it may be happening here? On our soil? No. So what are you really here to do, Teddy? I'm gonna get the proof, I'm gonna go back, and blow the lid off this place. That's it. Wait a minute. You started asking around about Ashecliffe. Waiting for a chance to get out here then suddenly they need a US marshal? I got lucky. There was a patient escape, it was the perfect excuse. No, no, no boss. Luck doesn't work that way. The world doesn't work that way. They got an electrified fence around a septic facility. Ward C is inside a Civil War fort? A chief of staff with ties to the OSS Funding from HUAC? Jesus Christ! Everything about this place stinks of ""government ops"". - What If they wanted you here? - Bullshit. - You were asking questions. - Bullshit. Bullshit? We came in for Rachel Solando? Where is one shred of evidence that she even existed? There's no way they could of known I'd be assigned to this case. No way... While you were looking into them, they were looking into you. All they need to do is fake an escape to get you here. And now they have you. They have us both, here, now. Marshal, are you out here? This is deputy warden McPherson. Marshal! How about that? They found us huh. It's an island, boss. They're always gonna find us. I know you are in there... We're getting off of this Goddamned island. You and me. Come on! - Come on! - Go! Get dried off. Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you. Now! And hurry up, this thing is turning into a goddamn hurricane! I dropped those suits off to be cleaned. It should be ready by tomorrow. That is if we don't all wash away first. Speaking of which, I'm afraid your smokes were pretty much done for. So... This is our only choice, huh? Got something really nice in prison already if that don't work for you... Now that you mention it, these are just fine. That's why I must repeat my insistence that all ward C patients be placed in manual restraints. If the facility floods, they'll drown. You know that. - That would take a lot of flooding. - We are on an island, in the middle of the ocean, during a hurricane. A lot of flooding seems like a distinct possibility. It's a gamble, Steven. say the power fails There's a backup generator. And if that goes? The cell doors will open. Where are they going to go? Hmm? They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over to the mainland and wreak havoc. You're quite right. They're far more likely to wreak havoc right here on us. If they're manacled to the floor, they'll die. That's human beings. You can't live with that, can you? Frankly, if it were up to me, I'd put all in ward A and B in manual restraints as well. Excuse me Excuse me - Marshal. - I'm sorry doctor, I just have one quick question. Yes, I will be with you in a moment. We spoke this morning about Rachel Solando's note The law of 4, I loved that. You said you had no idea what that second line could refer to. Correct? Who is 67? Yes, I'm afraid I still don't. None of us do. Uh huh. Nothing comes to mind. Nothing? Because I believe I just heard you say that there are patients in ward C. And of patients, in wards A and B Which means there is a total of what? patients here in this facility. That is correct, yes. Then it seems that Rachel Solando was suggesting you have a 67th patient, doctor - But I'm afraid we don't. - This Is ridiculous. - What are you doing here? - We are doing our goddamn job. Didn't McPherson tell you the good news? No, what's the good news, doctor? Rachel has been found. She's here. Safe and sound. There is not a mark on her. Who are these men? Why are they in my house? Police officers, Rachel. They... have a few questions. Ma'am. There's been a sighting of a known Communist subversive in this area passing out literature Here? In this neighborhood? Yes, I'm afraid so. If you can tell us what you did yesterday, where you were, it would really help us narrow our search. Yes... Well, I...umm I made breakfast for Jim and the children, and then I... I packed Jim's lunch and he left. Then I sent the children off to school. And then... I decided to take a long swim in the lake. I see... And after that? After that... I thought of you. I... I'm sorry, ma'am. I don't know what you're talking about. Don't you know how lonely I've been, Jim? You're gone... You're dead. I cry every night. How am I supposed to survive? God. Rachel... it will be all right. I'm so sorry, but... everything is gonna be all right? Okay? I buried you. I buried an empty casket. Your body rained down lumps of flesh splashing into the sea eaten by sharks. My Jim is dead, So who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?! Who are you?! Who are you?! I'm sorry about that. I didn't want to interrupt, I thought she might tell you something, but... we found her down by the lighthouse, skipping stones. We have no idea how she got out there. I'm going to ask you both to go down into basement. There's food, water, and cots. It's the safest place to be when the hurricane hits. Are you all right? You look pale. I'm fine, it's just uh... Boss, are you okay? It's just so Goddamn bright? Isn't it? Photo sensitivity, headaches sometimes? Marshal are you having a migraine? I'll be alright. - What's wrong with him. - Take these, marshal. You'll sleep a couple of hours, wake up clear as a bell. He's having a migraine. Imagine someone sawed open your head and filled it with razors then shook it as hard as they could. Take the pills, marshal. - No... I don't want the pills. - It'll stop the pain. Take the pills. He's going to need to lie down. Careful. All right. Gonna be okay. Relax. - Who is that? - Him? That's the warden. Don't you worry about him, alright? Looks like an ex-military prick. You know what? I ain't gonna argue with you on that one. You should have saved me. You should have saved all of us. Hey buddy. Hey. Laeddis. Yes. Hi, buddy. No hard feelings, right? No hard feelings. Little something for later. Because I know how much you need it. Clock's ticking, my friend. We're running out of time. Give me a hand here. I could get into trouble. I'm dead? I'm so sorry. Why didn't you save me? I tried, I wanted to, but by the time I got there, it was too late. See? Aren't they beautiful? Why are you all wet, baby? Laeddis isn't dead. He isn't gone. He's still here. I know. We need to find him, Teddy. You need to find him and you kill him dead. Shhh. It's okay. Shh. Again! The generator is faulty. Are you okay boss? This goddamn migraine! Back up generators failed. The whole place has gone crazy. What do you want to do? Christ! No, no, no! Put it down. Now! Now! You think the whole electrical system is fried? I'd say that it's a good possibility. All electronic security... fences, gates, the doors Come on. Nice day for a stroll don't you think? To ward C for example. Maybe we'll run into Andrew Leaddis. The guy I told you about, George Noyce? He told me this is where they keep the worse ones. The guys even the other inmates are scared of. Noyce give you anything on the layout? Not really. All that he remembers was people scream day and night. There were no windows. There were bars everywhere. Jesus Christ! First time on ward C, right? - Yes, yes... - Yes. - Yeah, heard stories, but... - Trust me, sons. You haven't heard shit. We got most of the bugsies locked down now, But some of them are still loose. If you see one don't try to restrain him yourselves. These fuckers will kill you. Clear? Alright. Get your asses moving then. Go on. He's here. Laeddis. I can feel him. Tag! You're it. Ted! Listen to me! Listen! I do not want to leave, all right? Why would anyone want to? We hear things here. About the outside world. About atolls. About the h-bomb tests. You know how a hydrogen bomb works? - With... Hydrogen? - That's funny. - Boss! - Other bombs explode, right? But not the hydrogen bomb It implodes. Creating an explosion to the thousandth millionth degree. - Do you get it? - Yeah. Yeah. - Do you? - I get it! Let em go! No! What are you doing? Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus! You got Billings? What's the fucks the matter with you guys? Catch them, not kill them! He jumped at us. You give me a hand with him. We've got to get him to the infirmary. No! Not you, not you. Take a walk. Come on! Paula's gonna have my Goddamn balls for this.. Laeddis.... Laeddis.... You're dead, we're all dead. This is hell, we're in hell. Please... ................... Stop me. Before I kill more. Go! Please, please! Laeddis ... You told me I'd be free of this place. You promised. You lied. Laeddis? Laeddis!? That's pretty damned funny. Your voice... Don't you recognize it? After all the talks we've had? After all the lies that you've told me? Let me see your face. They say I'm theirs now. They say I'll never leave here. Your match is about to go out. Let me see your goddamn face now! Why? So you can lie to me more? - This isn't about the truth! - Yes it is. - It's about exposing the truth. - This is about you! And Laeddis. That's all it's ever been about. I was incidental. A way in. George? George Noyce? No, it's not possible, You can't be here. Do you like it? Who did this to you, George? You did! What the hell do you mean? What are you talking all of your fucking talk And I'm back here because of you! George, I how did they get you out of Dedham. Huh? However this happened, Im gonna find a way to fix this. You understand me? I'll never get out now. I got out once, But not twice, never twice. - Tell me how they got you here? - They knew! Don't you get it? Everything you were up to. Your whole plan. This is a game. All of this... is for you. You're not investigating anything. You're a fucking rat in a maze. George... you're wrong. Really? Been alone much since you got here? I'm been with my partner. You have never worked with him before, have you? He's a... US Marshal from Seattle. You have never worked with him before, have you? George, look... I know people. I trust this man. Then, they've already won. Fuck! They're going to... take me to the lighthouse. They're going to cut into my brain. And I'm only here because of you! George, I'm going to get you out of here. You're not going to the lighthouse. You can't dig out the truth and kill Laeddis at the same time. You've got to make a choice you understand that, don't you? I'm not here to kill anyone. - Liar! - I not gonna kill him! I swear to you ... She's dead. Let her go... Let her go. Tell him Teddy... Tell him why. You've got to do it. There's no other way. - Let her go. - Tell him about the day you brought me my locket... You've gotta do it! How I told you my heart was breaking. And you asked me why? She's fucking with your head. And then i told you it was from happiness. She'll kill you. She's going to kill you. You want to uncover the truth? You've gotta let her go ... - I can't. - You have to let her go! I can't! I can't. Then you'll never leave this island. Dolores? He's not in this ward. He was transferred... Out of here. If he's not in ward A, there's only one place he can be The lighthouse. Hey! God help you. Boss, we got problems. McPherson and Cawley are in the building. They heard an orderly went batshit on a patient, They're looking all over the place for him. They're on the way to the roof. Let's get the hell out of here. This way. Just keep going. We belong here - What happened to you? - What do you mean? Where were you? After we got that guy to the infirmary, I took a little detour to patient records. Did you ever find Laeddis? No. - No. I never found him. - Well I've got the next best thing. His intake form. It was the only thing in his file. No session notes. No incident reports. No photographs... just this. It was weird. Here, take a look. I'll look at it later. What's the matter, boss? I'll take a look at it later, that's all. Ashecliffe's that way. I'm not going to Ashecliffe. I'm going to the lighthouse. I'm going to find out what the fuck is happening on this island. Here it is. Damn! We're too far South. We're gonna have to double back. There's no way we could cross those rocks. There could be a way behind those trees. Maybe a path that goes around the rocks that leads over to the lighthouse. What are we doing here? We've got the intake form. It proves there's a 67th patient... which they've said repeatedly doesn't exist. I'm getting to that lighthouse. Do you understand? What the hell can I say to you to stop you? Why would you want to Chuck? Why? Because climbing down there when it's dark is a thin step short to suicide. That's why. Okay. Maybe you better sit this one out then. You brought me into this, boss. And now I am trapped here on this rock. On this island. Without no one to rely on but eachother. And now you're acting like......... Like what? Like what? How am I acting? What the hell happened back there in those cells, Ted? - What do you think the weather is like in Portland, Chuck? - I'm from Seattle. Seattle? I'll going on...alone. I'm going with you, boss. I said alone. Fine. Damn it! Damn it! I knew it wouldn't take long. But I couldn't get to it. The tide was up. Chuck! Chuck! Come on! Chuck! Where are you, Chuck? Chuck! Chuck! Who are you? I'm Teddy Daniels. I'm a cop. You're the marshal. That's right. Would you mind... taking your hand from behind your back, please? Why? Why?! I want to make sure what you're holding won't hurt me. I'm gonna keep this... If you don't mind. Fine by me. You're Rachel Solando. The real one. Did you kill your children? I never had children. I was never married. And before I was a patient in Ashecliff, I worked here. You were a nurse? I was a doctor, marshal. You think I'm crazy? - No, I ... - And if I say I'm not crazy ... well that hardly helps, does it? That's the Kafkaesque genius of it. People tell the world you're crazy and all your protests to the contrary, just confirms what they're saying. I'm not following you. I'm sorry. Once you are declared insane, then anything you do is called a part of an insanity. Your reasonable protests or denial. Valid fears, paranoia. Survival instincts. Defense mechanisms. You're smarter than you look marshal. That's probably not a good thing. Tell me something... Yeah... What happened to you? I started asking about these large shipments of sodium-anatol. - An opium-based hallucinogen. - Psychotropic drugs. I asked about the surgeries, too. Ever heard of trans-orbital lobotomy? They zap the patient with electroshocks, then go through the eye with an ice pick and pull out some nerve fibers. Makes the patients much more obedient. Tractable. It's barbaric. Unconscionable. Do you know how pain enters the body marshal? Do you? Depends on where you hurt. No, it has nothing to do with the flesh. The brain controls pain. The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep, hunger, anger... everything. What If you could control it? The brain? Re-create a man, so he doesn't feel pain. Or love. Or sympathy. A man who can't be interrogated because he has no memories to confess. You can never take away all a man's memories. Never. Marshal, the North Koreans used American POWs during their brainwashing experiments. They turned soldiers into traitors. That's what they are doing here. They're creating ghosts to go out in the world. And do things sane men never do. To have that kind of ability, that kind of knowledge. That would take years. Years of research, hundreds of patients to experiment on. years from now, people will look back and say, ""Here. This place is where it all began."" The Nazis used the Jews. The Soviets used prisoners in their own gulags and we... We tested patients, on Shutter Island. No, they won't ... No You do understand That they can't let you leave? I am a federal marshal ... They can't stop me. I was an esteemed psychiatrist, from a respected family. It didn't matter. Let me ask you ... any past traumas in your life? Yes. Why? Why would that matter? Because they can point to some event in your past and say it is the reason you lost your sanity...... So that when they commit you here Your friends and colleagues will say, ""Of course he cracked."" ""And who wouldn't have, after what he'd been through."" That could be said of anyone - anyone at all. - The point is they're going to say it about you. How's your head? - My head? - Any funny dreams lately? Trouble sleeping? Headaches? I am prone to migraines. Yes. Jesus! You haven't taken any pills, have you? - I mean even aspirin? - They hit the aspirin? Jesus! And you ate the food in the cafeteria and drank coffee they gave you. You tell me at least that you've been smoking your own cigarettes. No... no. No. I haven't. It takes to hours for neuroleptic narcotics... To reach sufficient levels in the blood stream. Pulse becomes first First the fingertips and then eventually the whole hand. Seen any waking nightmares lately, marshal? Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse? Tell me. Brain surgery. ""Let's open the skull and see what happens if we pull on this"" kind. ""We learned it from the Nazi's"" kind. It's where they create the ghosts. Who knows about this? On the island I mean. Who? Everyone. Oh come on. The nurses? The orderlies? - They couldn't possibly know... - Everyone. You can't stay here. They think I'm dead, that I drowned. I'm afraid if they come looking for you, they might find me. I'm sorry, but you have to go. I'm gonna come back for you. I won't be here. I move during the day. new places every night. But I could come get you off of this island. Haven't you heard a word I've said? The only way off the island is the ferry and they control it. You'll never leave here. I had a friend. I was with him yesterday, but we got separated. Have you seen him? Marshal... You have no friends. There you are. We've been wondering when you'd show up. Have a seat. Come on. Taking a leisurely stroll? Were we? I was just... just looking around. Did you enjoy God's latest gift? - What? - God's gift. The violence. When I came downstairs in my home and I saw that tree in my living room, it reached down for me like a divine hand. God loves violence. - I hadn't noticed. - Sure you have. Why else would there be so much of it? It's in us. It's what we are. We wage war, we burn sacrifices, we pillage and plunder and tear at the flesh of our brothers and why? Because God gave us violence to wage in his honor. I thought God gave us moral order. There is no moral order as pure as this storm. There's no moral order at all. There's just this: can my violence conquer yours? - I'm not violent. - Yes you are. You're as violent as they come. I know this because I'm as violent as they come. With the constraints of society, we are lifted and If I was all that stood between you and a meal, you would crack my skull with a rock and eat my meaty parts. Wouldn't you? Cawley thinks you're harmless, that you can be controlled, but I know different. - You don't know me. - Oh but I do. Oh I know you. We've known each other for centuries. If I was to sink my teeth into your eye right now, would you be able to stop me before I blinded you? Give it a try. That's the spirit. Where have you been? Wandering, just looking at your island. Oh I forgot. You're leaving. Now that Rachel has been found. Sure. Yeah. Big meeting? Oh, yes ... Apparently there was an unidentified man in ward C yesterday He subdued a highly dangerous patient. Quite handily. Is that so? It seems he had a long conversation with a paranoid schizophrenic, George Noyce. This Noyce, you said his name was, - he's delusional? - Oh extremely. He can be quite upsetting. In fact, two weeks ago, a patient got so wound up by one of Noyce's stories that he beat him up. Cigarette? Oh. No, thanks. I quit. So, you're taking the ferry? Oh yes. Absolutely. I uh... I think we've gotten all we came here for so. ""We"" marshal? Speaking of which. Have you - seen him, Doctor? - Who? My partner, Chuck. You don't have a partner, Marshal. You came here alone. You know, I've built something valuable here. And valuable things have a way of being misunderstood in their own time. Everyone wants a quick fix, they always have. I'm trying to do something that people, yourself included, don't understand. And I'm not going to give up without a fight. I can see that... So tell me again about your partner. What partner? Marshal... Going somewhere? No. Just heading out to the ferry. So... I'm afraid it's the other way. If you wait a moment, I'll find someone who can take you to the dock. What is this, doctor? It's just a sedative. - It's for precaution. - Precaution? What are you going to do? Kill me? Marshal. You think you deserve it? For what? For provoking you? and, forgive me, what doesn't provoke you? Remarks... - Words... - Nazis! Well that, too. And of course, memories, dreams... Did you know that the word ""trauma"" comes from the Greek for ""wound""? And what is the German word for ""dream"" ""Traumen"". Traumen. Wounds can create monsters. And you ... you are wounded, marshal. Wouldn't you agree, when you see a monster you must stop it? - I agree. - Yes... What are you doing, baby? You've got to get to the ferry. No. No. No. If the world thinks that Chuck is dead, then he is perfect for their experiments. There's only one place they'd take him. You go there and you'll die. He's my partner. If they are hurting him, if they are holding him against his will, I've got to bring him out. I can't lose anyone else. Don't go, Teddy. Please don't do this. Don't go. I'm sorry, honey. I love this thing because you gave it to me But the truth is ... it's one fucking ugly tie. No! Don't move! Stay where you are! Are you going to kill me? No. I'm not gonna kill you. Why are you all wet, baby? - What did you say? - You know exactly what I said. The rifle's empty by the way. Have a seat. For god's sake dry off you're going to catch a cold. Alright. How badly did you hurt the guard? I don't know what you're talking about. Yes. He's here. Have Dr.Sheehan take a good look at your man before you send him up. So, Dr. Shehan... He came on the ferry this morining. Not exactly. You blew up my car. I really loved that car. Sorry to hear about that. Tremors are getting pretty bad. How are the hallucinations? Get out of here, Teddy. This place is gonna be the end of you. - Not bad. - They'll get worse. I know. Dr. Solando... she told me about neuroleptics. Did she now? And when was this? I found the doctor, in a cave out by the cliffs. But you'll never get to her. I don't doubt it. Considering she's not real. But your hallucinations are more severe than I thought. You are not on neuroleptics. You are not on anything as a matter of fact. Then what the fuck is this? Huh, what the fuck is this? Withdrawal. Withdrawal? From what? I haven't even had a Goddamned drink since I've been on this island. Chlorpromazine. I'm not a fan of pharmacology but I have to say in your case ... - Clorpro... what? - Chlorpromazine. The same thing we've been giving you for the past months. So for the past two years you've had somebody slipping me drugs in Boston. Is that it? Not Boston. Here. You've been here for two years. A patient of this institution. After everything I seen here, doctor, you really think you're gonna convince me I'm crazy, huh? Do you know the kind of people I deal with everyday? I'm a U.S. marshal. For Gods sake. You were a U.S. marshal. Here's a copy of the intake form. You broke into ward C for proof of the 67th patient If you'd gotten it to the mainland, you could have blown the lid off this place. - Wait... wait. - But somehow you couldn't find time to look at it. Well read it now. Go ahead. The patient is highly intelligent, highly delusional. Decorated army veteran. Present for the liberation of Dakau. Former U.S. marshal. Known proclivity for violence. Shows no remorse for his crime because he denies that the crime ever took place. Highly developed and fantastical narratives which preclude facing the truth of his actions... I've had enough of this bullshit. Where's my partner, huh? Where's Chuck? Where is he? Let's try this another way. Your wife's maiden name was ""Chanal"". Am I correct? - Don't you even talk about her! - I'm afraid I have to. Notice anything these four names have in common? Your rule of 4. - Andrew, what do you see? - If you have done anything - to my partner, doctor. That is a violation ... - Focus, Andrew. What do you see? The names ... have the same letters. Edward Daniels has exactly the same letters as Andrew Laeddis. The same as Rachel Solando and Dolores Chanal. The names - Are anagrams for each other. - Your tactics, they're not going to work on me. You came here for the truth. Here it is. Your name is Andrew Laeddis. The 67th patient at Ashecliffe is you, Andrew. Bullshit. You were committed here by court order months ago. Your crime is terrible. One you can't forgive yourself for. So you invented another self. Let's get down to the facts. You've created a story in which you're not a murderer, you are hero. Still a U.S marshal. Only here at Ashecliffe because of a case and you've uncovered a conspiracy So that anything we tell you about who you are, what you've done you can dismiss as lies, Andrew. My name is Edward Daniels. I've been hearing this fantasy for two years now. I know every detail. Patient 67. The storm. Rachel Solando. Your missing partner. The dreams you have every night. You were at Dakau, But you may not have killed any guards. I wish I could let you just live in your fantasy world. I really do. But you're violent, trained, dangerous. You're the most dangerous patient we have. You've injured orderlies. Guards. Other patients. Two weeks ago you attacked George Noyce. No, no! I am fucking on to you doctor! - You had Noyce beaten. - Of course I didn't. Give me one reason why I would even touch him. Because he called you Laeddis and you do anything not to be him. I have a transcript of that conversation you had with Noyce yesterday. This is about you and Laeddis. That's all it's ever been about No. No. He is saying that it's about ""me and Laeddis"". When you've asked him what happened to his face, said, and I quote again, ""You did this"". - No. He meant it was my fault he... - You almost killed him. The warden and the board of overseers are determined something be done. It's been decided. That unless, we can bring you back into sanity now, right now, permanent measures will be taken to ensure you can't hurt anyone ever again. They'll lobotomize you, Andrew. Do you understand? Yes, I understand. I understand just fine. If... if I don't play along with your little game here. Dr. Naehring is gonna turn me into one of his ghosts. What about my partner? You're gonna tell the U.S. marshal's office that he's a defense mechanism? Hello, boss. What the fuck is going on here? You working for him? I'm sorry about that someone had to stick with you. Keep you safe. You've been watching me, huh? Watching me every minute. Who... who are you? Who are you? Tell me. Don't you recognize me, Andrew? I've been you primary psychiatrist for the last two years. I am Lester Sheehan. And I told you about my wife ... - I know. - I climbed down a cliff to get you. I trusted you. I risked everything to come in here after you. Everything! I know, boss. We're running out of time here, Andrew, I swore before the entire board of overseers that I could construct The most radical, cutting edge role-play ever attempted in psychiatry and it would bring you back. I thought if we let you play this out we could get you to see how untrue, how impossible it is. We've had to run of the place for two days. Tell me, where are the Nazi experiments? The satanic O.R.'s? Andrew, listen to me. If we fail with you then everything we've tried to do here will be discredited. Everything. We are on the front line of a war here, old boy. And right now, it'll come down to you. Don't move! Don't move! - Andrew, no! - My name is Edward Daniels. This one is loaded. I can tell by the weight. I see. And that's your firearm marshal? You're sure? My initials are on the side and there's a dent in the barrel from when Philip Stacks shot at me. You're not going to fuck with my mind on this one Doc Then blast away, because that's the only way you're ever getting off this island. Andrew, please don't. My gun... What have you done to my Goddamn gun. It's a toy, Andrew. We're telling you the truth. Dolores was insane. Manic-depressive. Suicidal. You drank. Stayed away. Ignored what everyone had told you. You moved to that lake house after she, purposely, set your city apartment on fire Andrew! Andrew! Stop it! You're lying... Andrew, your children. Simon... - Henry... - I didn't have any children. Your wife drowned them. At the cabin by the lake. And here, the little girl, the one you dream of every night. I never had a little. The one who tells you over and over that you should have saved her Saved them all. Your daughter... Her name was Rachel. Are you going to deny that she ever lived? Andrew, are you? I'm so sorry, baby... I told you not to come in here. I told you... this would be the end of you. I'm back. We got him just outside of Oklahoma. Must of stopped ten places in between here and Tulsa. I could sleep for a week. Dolores? Dolores? Dolores? Dolores? Baby... why are you all wet? I missed you. I want to go home. You are home! Where are the kids? They're in school. It's Saturday, honey. School's not in on Saturday. My school is. Oh my God! My God! God! Oh my God, no! Come on! Come on! Please, God, no. No! No! No! No! Let's put them in the room. We'll dry them off... We'll change their clothes... They'll be our living dolls. Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic. If you ever loved me, Dolores... Please stop talking. I love you. Set me free! Honey... We'll give them baths... - I love you so much, Dolores. - And I love you. I love you. Andrew... Andrew, can you hear me? Rachel! Rachel, Rachel... Rachel. Rachel who? Rachel Laeddis... My daughter. Why are you here? Because I killed my wife. and why did you do that? Dhe murdered our children. And she told me to let her go. - Who is Teddy Daniels? - He doesn't exist. Neither does Rachel Solando. I made them up. Why? We need to hear you say it. After she tried to kill herself the first time, Dolores told me she... she had an insect... living inside her brain. She could feel it... clicking across her skull... pulling the wires, just for fun. She told me that. She told me but I didn't listen. I loved her so much. Why did you make them up? Because I can't take knowing that Dolores killed our children. I killed them, because I didn't get her help. I killed them... Here's my theory, Andrew. we broke through once before, nine months ago, and then you regressed. - I don't remember that. - I know. You reset, Andrew. Like a tape playing over and over on an endless loop. I hope that what we've done will be enough to stop it from ever happening again But I need to know ... you have accepted the reality. You came after me, huh, doctor? You tried to help me when no one else would. My name is Andrew Laeddis... And I murdered my wife in the spring of '52. How we doing this morning? Good. And You? Can't complain. So what's our next move? You tell me. I've gotta get off this rock, Chuck. Get back to the mainland. Whatever the hell is going on here. It's bad. Don't worry, partner. They're not gonna catch us. That's right. We're too smart for them. Yeah, we are. Aren't we? You know this place makes me wonder. Yeah? What's that boss? Which would be worse? To live as a monster ... or to die as a good man. Teddy?"
29,2017,War for the Planet of the Apes,American,"Two years have passed[9] since the human-hating bonobo Koba attacked the human survivors in San Francisco. Since then, Caesar and his tribe of intelligent apes have been forced against a rogue U.S. military faction known as Alpha-Omega. Led by a ruthless Colonel, Alpha-Omega employs many apes formerly loyal to Koba, derogatorily called ""donkeys"".
An Alpha-Omega platoon launches an attack on an ape outpost, but it fails and four soldiers, including one named Preacher and a ""donkey"" gorilla named Red, are captured. Caesar releases the soldiers, hoping the display of mercy will show the Colonel that the apes are not savages; Red escapes by injuring the albino gorilla Winter. Later, Caesar's eldest son Blue Eyes and lieutenant Rocket return from a long journey. Blue Eyes reports that they found a place across the desert that is ideal for the apes. Despite an uneasy Winter asserting that the apes should leave immediately, Caesar decides they need to prepare first. That night, the Colonel leads a team of soldiers in infiltrating the apes' home, where he kills Blue Eyes and Caesar's wife Cornelia. Upon discovering this, Caesar attempts to prevent the Colonel's escape but fails. Afterward, the apes are unable to find Winter, who they believe betrayed them out of fear.
In the morning, the tribe gathers to journey to safety. Leaving his youngest son, Cornelius, in the care of Blue Eyes' wife Lake, Caesar departs to exact revenge while serving as the decoy for the other apes. Accompanied by Rocket, his orangutan adviser Maurice, and his gorilla lieutenant Luca, the apes enter an abandoned village, where they kill a deserted soldier in self-defense. They then discover a mute girl, who Maurice befriends and adopts, giving her a small rag doll. They then find Winter at a beachside military camp, having become a ""donkey"". They confront Winter, who tells Caesar that the Colonel departed for the border, to meet more soldiers. Winter then attempts to call out for help, but the other apes restrain him, and Caesar accidentally suffocates him. While following the military, the apes discover soldiers who have been shot and left for dead. Their examination of a surviving soldier reveals that he is mute like the girl. Caesar then kills him in an act of mercy.
Later, the apes give chase after a hooded figure who stole one of their horses and are surprised to discover he is an intelligent ape from another zoo, named Bad Ape. While camping with Bad Ape, they discover that he knows where the border is and he hesitantly agrees to lead them there. The group reaches the border, where they see a quarantine facility. While attempting to get a closer look, Luca is killed protecting Caesar from some soldiers. An angered Caesar decides to proceed alone rather than continue to endanger his allies. While there, however, Caesar learns that Alpha-Omega captured his tribe and are forcing them to build a wall without food or water. Caesar is then captured by Red, who brings him to the Colonel. He is forced to work with the other apes, and when he inspires them to stop working, the Colonel threatens to kill Caesar to get the apes to continue.
Caesar deduces that the Colonel is barricading the facility to fend off other military forces who are against him for killing his own soldiers. The Colonel informs Caesar that the Simian Flu virus had mutated, and the human carriers subsequently became mute and devolved into a primitive state. He then has Caesar tortured with starvation to force the other apes to work. The mute girl, named Nova by Maurice, sneaks into the facility to give Caesar food, water, and her rag doll. To prevent her from being discovered, Rocket allows himself to be captured as a diversion. The next day, the Colonel comes to see if Caesar is still alive, and confiscates the doll upon discovering it. Together, Caesar and Rocket are able to work out a means of escape via an underground tunnel leading out of the facility. Though the plan is successful, Caesar remains behind to confront the Colonel as the facility comes under attack by the army of dissenting soldiers. However, he finds the Colonel infected by the virus via contact with Nova's doll. Caesar chooses not to kill the Colonel, instead watching him commit suicide.
The escaping apes are caught in the crossfire between the two armies while Red watches uncertainly. Caesar attempts to blow up a large fuel tank to take out the Alpha-Omega forces from behind, but he is shot with a crossbow by Preacher. Red then uses a grenade launcher to kill Preacher and save Caesar's life before he is shot dead by a soldier. Caesar succeeds in blowing up the tank and escapes the facility as it is consumed in a cascade of explosions, which then triggers an avalanche that wipes out the dissenting soldiers. The apes, carrying Nova, all survive by climbing nearby trees. They then cross the desert to find an oasis. While the other apes celebrate their new home, Maurice discovers Caesar's fatal wound. He promises to tell Cornelius who his father was and what he did for the apes. Caesar then dies peacefully while Maurice mourns his death and the other apes look on.",7.4,tt3450958,"SOFTLY Captain!

Okay, let's go. The soldiers who are coming here... they are not coming to join you, are they? I saw men outside on the wall, preparing for battle. They told me you were smart... but that's impressive. No. They won't be joining me. They are against you? They fear me. CAESAR: Why? Because you kill your own men? We found bodies. Something wrong... with these men. Jesus Christ, you are impressive. Well, you paint quite a picture. What you must think of me. I think you have no mercy. You came here to kill me. Were you gonna show me mercy? I showed you mercy... when I spared your men. I offered you peace... and you killed my family. EXHALES HEAVILY SWITCH CLICKS MUSIC STOPS THE COLONEL: Mercy. You have any idea what your mercy would do to us? You're much stronger than we are. You're smart as hell. No matter what you say, you'd eventually replace us. That's the law of nature. The irony is, we created you. We tried to defy nature, bend it to our will. Nature has been punishing us for our arrogance... ever since. months ago, I sent out recon units to look for your base. My own son was a soldier with one of the units. One day he suddenly stopped speaking. He became primitive, like an animal. They contacted me and said that they thought he'd lost his mind. That the war was too much for him. Then the man who cared for him stopped speaking too. Their medic had a theory, before he stopped speaking... that the virus that almost wiped us out... the virus that every human survivor still carries... had suddenly changed. Mutated. And that if it spread... it would destroy humanity for good this time. Not by killing us... but by robbing us of those things that make us human. Our speech, our higher thinking... It would turn us into beasts. You talk about mercy? What would you have done? It was a moment of clarity for me. I realized... that I would have to sacrifice my only son... so that humanity could be saved. I held that gun in my hand... for a long time. I pointed it at my only child... he looked at me... trust in his eyes. Even in his primitive gaze... I felt his... love. GULPS I pulled the trigger. It purified me. It made my purpose clear. I gave the orders to kill the other infected. All of them. Burn their belongings... and anything that might spread contamination. Some of the men questioned my judgment. I was asking them to do what I had done. Sacrifice their friends... their family. Of course, they refused. So I had them killed too. Others with children... deserted into the woods. One of those cowards fled to my superiors up North. They tried to convince me this plague could be dealt with medically. That's when I realized that they had learned nothing... from our past. You killed them too? What did I do, Preacher? You severed their heads, sir. Except for the one I spared... so that he could return, and deliver a message. If they wanted to relieve me of my command... they would have to meet me here... and do it themselves. This used to be a weapons depot. They turned it into a relocation camp when the crisis was just beginning. But the weapons are still here... inside the mountain. CAESAR: How many men... will be coming? Probably all of them. But don't get any ideas. The only thing they fear more than me is you apes. This is... a holy war. All of human history has led to this moment. If we lose... we'll be the last of our kind. It will be a planet of apes. And we will become your cattle. Look at you. You think I'm sick, don't you? I didn't mean to kill your son. But if his destiny was to inherit your unholy kingdom... I'm glad I did it. GROWLS PREACHER: Hey! Hey! Get back! Donkey, hold him! Hey! GROWLING CHOKING So emotional! I can see how conflicted you are. You're confused in your purpose. You are angry at me for something I did that was an act of war. But you're taking this all much too personally. What do you think... my men would have done to your apes if you had killed me? Or is killing me more important? PANTING Soldiers everywhere! How will we get in? SNIFFLES AND CHITTERS Must get in somehow... Must get in! In? In? No! No go in! No...

30,2003,Finding Nemo,American,"Two clownfish, Marlin and Coral, admire their new home in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, and their clutch of 400 eggs. After a brief play fight, they spot a hungry barracuda staring at them. Coral tries to save the eggs, and the barracuda attacks, knocking Marlin unconscious. He wakes up to find Coral and all but one of the eggs have been eaten by the barracuda; Marlin names this last egg Nemo.
On the first day of school, Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a field trip. While Marlin talks to the teacher, Mr. Ray, Nemo sneaks away from the reef towards a boat, and is captured by a scuba diver. As the boat departs, one of the divers accidentally knocks his diving mask overboard. Marlin chases after the boat and meets Dory, a blue tang who suffers from short term memory loss. Marlin and Dory meet a clan of sharks, Bruce, Anchor, and Chum, who claim to be vegetarians. Marlin discovers the diver's mask, and notices an address written on it. When he argues with Dory, and accidentally gives her a nosebleed, the blood causes Bruce to lose control of himself, and enter a violent feeding frenzy. The pair escape from Bruce.
Meanwhile, Nemo is placed in a fish tank in a dentist’s office, where he meets the Tank Gang, led by Gill. They learn Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece Darla, who has killed previous fish given to her. Gill devises a plan to escape: jam the tank's filter with a pebble so the dentist will put the fish in plastic bags to clean the tank, then roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam the filter, but fails, almost dying in the process.
After the mask falls into a trench in the deep sea, Dory and Marlin struggle to escape an anglerfish in the trench. Dory finds the diving mask, and reads the address as 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. As Dory finishes reading the address on the mask, Marlin is able to trap the Anglerfish, using the eyepiece of the mask. To her own disbelief, Dory remembers the address on her own despite her short-term memory loss. After receiving directions to Sydney from a school of moonfish, Marlin and Dory encounter a bloom of jellyfish that traps them, and nearly stings them to death. Marlin loses consciousness, and wakes on the back of a sea turtle named Crush, who takes Marlin and Dory on the East Australian Current. Marlin tells the details of his long journey with Dory and a group of young sea turtles, led by Squirt, Crush's son. News of his quest spreads across the ocean.
Near the harbor, a pelican named Nigel flies to the dentist's office, and brings news of Marlin's efforts. Inspired, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. He succeeds, but the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.
After leaving the Current, Marlin and Dory are engulfed by a blue whale. Inside the whale's mouth, Marlin desperately tries to escape, while Dory communicates with the whale, which carries them to Sydney Harbour and expels them through his blowhole. They meet Nigel, and after helping the pair escape from a massive flock of seagulls, he takes them to the dentist's office. Darla has just arrived, and the dentist is handing Nemo to her. Nemo plays dead to save himself as Nigel arrives, causing Darla to scream. Upon seeing Nemo, Marlin mistakenly believes he is dead. After Nigel is violently thrown out by the dentist, Gill helps Nemo escape into a drain that leads to the ocean.
Depressed, Marlin leaves Dory, and begins to swim home. Dory meets Nemo when he reaches the ocean, but she has lost her memory. Eventually, Dory's memory returns after she reads the word ""Sydney"" on a drainpipe. She reunites Nemo with Marlin, but is caught in a fishing net with a school of grouper. Nemo enters the net, and orders the group to swim downward to break the net, enabling them to escape. After returning home, Marlin and Dory proudly watch Mr. Ray carry Nemo and his friends to school. Before the credits, the filter breaks down, and the tank fish escape the tank and into the harbor, but find that they are still in their plastic bags.
",8.2,tt0266543,"- Wow. - Mmm. - Wow. - Mm-hmm. - Wow. - Yes, Marlin. No, I see it. It's beautiful. So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view... you didn't think you'd get the whole ocean, did you? Oh, yeah. A fish can breathe out here. Did your man deliver, or did he deliver? - My man delivered. - And it wasn't so easy. Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place. You better believe they did- every single one of them. Mm-hmm. You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome. So, you do like it, don't you? No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But, Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable... with the great schools and the amazing view... but do we really need so much space? Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look, look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out... and they see a whale! Right by their bedroom window. Shh. You'll wake the kids. Oh, right, right. Aw, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them. You want to name all of them right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Junior... and this half Coral Junior. - OK, we're done. - I like Nemo. Nemo. We'll name one Nemo... but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Junior. Just think, in a couple of days... - we're going to be parents. - Yeah. What if they don't like me? - Marlin. - No, really. There's over eggs. Odds are, one will like you. What? - You remember how we met? - I try not to. Well, I remember. Excuse me, miss... can you check and see if I have a hook in my lip? You got a little closer because it was wiggling. - Get away, get away! - Here he is. Cutie's here. Where did everybody go? Coral, get inside the house. No, Coral, don't. They'll be fine. Just get inside- You, right now. No! Ow! Oh! Ooh! Ooh! Coral! Coral? Coral? Coral? Coral? Coral? Oh! Ohh. There, there, there. It's OK. Daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise, I will never let anything happen to you... Nemo. First day of school! Wake up, wake up! First day of school. I don't want to go to school- five more minutes. Not you, Dad, me. - OK. Huh? - Get up, get up. It's time for school, time for school. All right, I'm up. Whoa! - Nemo! - First day of school! - Nemo, don't move. - Unh! Unh! You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it. Unh! - You feel a break? - No. Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid rushes to the area. - Are you woozy? - No. - How many stripes do I have? - I'm fine. - Answer the stripe question. - Three. No! See? Something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three- That's all I have? You're OK. How's the lucky fin? - Lucky. - Let's see. Are you sure you want to go to school this year? There's no problem if you don't. You can wait or years. Come on, Dad, it's time for school. - Forgot to brush. - Ohh. Do you want this anemone to sting you? - Yes. - Brush. - OK, I'm done. - You missed a spot. - Where? - There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here. All right, we're excited. The first day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn to get some knowledge. What's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean? - It's not safe. - That's my boy. First, we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out... and back in. And then we go out... and back in. And then one more time- out and back in. And sometimes, if you want to do it four times- - Dad... - All right, come on, boy. Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark. - I highly doubt that. - Have you ever met a shark? No, and I don't plan to. - How old are sea turtles? - I don't know. Sandy Plankton from next door... he says that sea turtles live to be about years old. If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking to the shark, OK? Whoa! Hold on. Wait to cross. Hold my fin. Dad, you're not going to freak out... like you did at the petting zoo, are you? That snail was about to charge. Hmm. I wonder where we're supposed to go. Bye, Mom! I'll pick you up after school. Ha ha! Come on, you guys, stop it! Give it back! Come on, we'll try over there. Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher? Well, look who's out of the anemone. Yes. Shocking, I know. - Marty, right? - Marlin. - Bob. - Ted. Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Tell us a joke. - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish. - Come on, clownie. - Do something funny. All right, I know one joke. There's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea- He doesn't walk up, he swims up. Actually, the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place, and then the sea cucumber... Well, they-I'm mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber. None of them were walking, so forget that I- Sheldon! Get out of Mr. Johannsen's yard now! - Whoa! - All right, you kids! Ooh, where'd you go? Dad, can I go play, too? Can I? I would feel better if you'd play on the sponge beds. That's where I would play. - What's wrong with his fin? - He looks funny. Ow! Hey, what'd I do? Be nice. It's his first time at school. He was born with it. We call it his lucky fin. - Dad... - See this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles... but you can't really tell. Especially when I twirl them like this. I'm H-2-O intolerant. - Ah-choo! - I'm obnoxious. Oh Let's name the zones, the zones, the zones Let's name the zones of the open sea Mr. Ray! - Come on, Nemo. - You better stay with me. Mesopelagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic All the rest are too deep for you and me to see Huh. I wonder where my class has gone? We're under here! Oh, there you are. Climb aboard, explorers. Oh, knowledge exploring Is, oh, so lyrical When you think thoughts that are empirical Dad, you can go now. - Hello. Who is this? - I'm Nemo. Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question. - OK. - You live in what kind of home? An anemon-none. A nemenem-menome. OK, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers. Just so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming... I let him take a break, 10, minutes. Dad, it's time for you to go now. Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. OK, class, optical orbits up front. And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion... to ourselves. That means you, Jimmy. Aw, man! Bye, Nemo! Bye, Dad! Bye, son! Be safe. You're doing pretty well for a first-timer. You can't hold on to them forever, can you? I had a tough time with my oldest out at the drop off. They got to grow up- The drop off? They're going to the drop off? What are you, insane? Why don't we fry them up now and serve them with chips? Hey, Marty, calm down. Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy. Pony boy? For a clownfish, he really isn't that funny. Pity. Oh Let's name the species, the species, the species Let's name the species that live in the sea Whoa. There's Porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa Anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas, three Gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma And some fish like you and me Come on, sing with me. Oh Just the girls this time. Oh, seaweed is cool Seaweed is fun It makes its food OK, the drop off. All right, kids, feel free to explore... but stay close. Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather.

There's porifera, coelenterata Hydrozoa, scyphozoa Anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas, three Hey, guys, wait up! Whoa. Cool. Saved your life! Aw, you guys made me ink. What's that? I know what that is. Sandy Plankton saw one. He said it was called a butt. - Whoa. - Wow. That's a pretty big butt. Oh, look at me. I'm going to touch the butt. - Ah-choo! Whoa! - Ha ha ha! Oh, yeah? Let's see you get closer. OK. Beat that. Come on, Nemo. How far can you go? My dad says it's not safe. - Nemo! No! - Dad? You were about to swim into open water. No, I wasn't- Good thing I was here. If I hadn't shown up- - He wasn't going to go. - He was too afraid. No, I wasn't. This does not concern you, kids... and you're lucky I don't tell your parents. You know you can't swim well. I can swim fine, Dad, OK? No, it's not OK. You shouldn't be near here. OK, I was right. You'll start school in a year or two. No, Dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean- Clearly, you're not ready... and you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do these things... but you just can't, Nemo! I hate you. There's Nothing to see. Gather. Over there. Excuse me. Is there anything I can do? I am a scientist, sir. Is there any problem? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer, and it's a little too soon... for him to be out here unsupervised. I can assure you, he's quite safe with me. I'm sure he is, but you have a large class... and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking. I'm not saying you're not looking. Oh, my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea! Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You'll get stuck out there... and I'll have to get you before another fish does. Get back here! I said get back here now! Stop! You take one more move, mister... Don't you dare! If you put one fin on that boat... Are you listening to me? Don't touch the bo-Nemo! You paddle your little tail right back here, Nemo. That's right.

Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! No! Aah! Uhh. Nemo! Nemo! Whoa! Hold on. Oh, no. No. No, it's gone. It's gone. No, no, it can't be gone. No, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! Nemo! Nemo! No! No, please, no! No, no! Has anybody seen a boat? Please! A white boat! They took my son! My son! Help me, please. - Look out! - What? Ooh. Ohh. Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry. I didn't see you. - Sir? Are you OK? - He's gone, he's gone. There, there. It's all right. - He's gone. - It'll be OK. No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat. A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. - You have? - It passed by not too long ago. - A white one? - Hi. I'm Dory. Where? Which way? Oh, oh, oh. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so much. No problem. Hey... Wait! - Will you quit it? - What? I'm trying to swim here. Ocean isn't big enough for you? You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Do you? Do you? You want a piece of me? Ooh, I'm scared now. What? - Wait a minute. - Stop following me, OK? What? You're showing me where the boat went. A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going. I did? Oh, no. If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny. And I know funny. I'm a clownfish. No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss. Short-term memory loss. I don't believe this. No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family. At least, I think it does. Um, hmm. Where are they? Can I help you? Something's wrong with you-really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. Hello. - Ohh. - Well, hi! Name's Bruce. It's all right. I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what's a couple of bites like you... doing out so late, eh? We're not doing anything. We're not even out. Great! Then how'd you morsels... like to come to a little get-together I'm having? You mean, like a party? Yeah, right. A party. What do you say? I love parties. That sounds like fun. Parties are fun, and it's tempting, but- Oh, come on, I insist. OK. That's all that matters. Hey, look, balloons. It is a party. Ha ha ha ha! Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy. You wouldn't want one of them to pop. Oh. Ohh. Anchor! Chum! There you are, Bruce. Finally. - We got company. - It's about time, mate. We've already gone through the snacks... and I'm still starving. We almost had a feeding frenzy. Come on, let's get this over with. Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge. I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image... I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food. Except stinkin' dolphins. Dolphins. Yeah. They think they're so cute. Look at me. I'm a flippin' little dolphin. Let me flip for you. Ain't I something? Right, then. Today's meeting is Step 5- Bring a Fish Friend. Do you all have your friends? Got mine. - Hey, there. - How about you, Chum? Oh, I... seem to have misplaced my friend. That's all right, Chum. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step. You can help yourself to one of my friends. Thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum, eh? I'll start the testimonies. Hello. My name is Bruce. Hello, Bruce. It has been three weeks since my last fish. On my honor, or may I be chopped up and made into soup. - You're an inspiration! - Amen. Right, then. Who's next? Pick me, pick me. Yes. The little Sheila down the front. - Whoo! - Come on up here. Hi. I'm Dory. - Hello, Dory. - And, uh, well... I don't think I've ever eaten a fish. - That's incredible. - Good on you, mate. I'm glad I got that off my chest. All right, anyone else? How about you, mate? What's your problem? Me? I don't have a problem. Oh, OK. - Denial. - Aah! Just start with your name. OK. Uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish. - A clownfish? Really? - Tell us a joke. I love jokes. I actually do know one that's pretty good. There was this mollusk... and he walks up to a sea cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers... but in a joke, everyone talks... so the sea mollusk says to the cucumber... Daddy! Nemo! Nemo! Ha ha! Nemo! I don't get it. For a clownfish, he's not that funny. No, no, no, no. He's my son. He was taken by these divers. Humans-think they own everything. Probably American. Now, there is a father- Looking for his little boy. What do these markings mean? - Group hug. - We're all mates here, mate. I can't read human. We got to find a fish that can read this. - Hey, look, sharks. - No, no, no, Dory! - Guys, guys. - No, Dory. That's mine. Give it to me. Gimme! Ow! Oh, I'm sorry. Are you OK? - Ow, ow, ow. - I'm so sorry. You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding? - Ohh. - Ow, ow, ow. Dory, are you OK-Ohh. Ohh, that's good. Intervention! - Just a bite. - Hold it together, mate! Remember, Bruce, fish are friends, not food! - Food! - Dory, look out! - Aah! - I'm having fish tonight! Remember the steps, mate! Aah! - Aah! Whoa! - Aah! - Just one bite! - Aah! G'day. Grr! There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape! Who is it? Dory, help me find a way out! Sorry. Come back later. We're trying to escape. - There's got to be a way out! - Here's something. Es-cap-e. I wonder what that means. Funny. It's spelled just like escape. - Let's go. - Aah! Here's Brucey! Wait a minute. You can read? I can read? That's right. I can read! Well, then, here. Read this now. - Aah! - Ohh! He really doesn't mean it. He never even knew his father. Don't fall off the wagon! - Aah! - Aah! Oh, no, it's blocked! No, Bruce, focus. Sorry about Bruce, mate. He's really a nice guy. I need to get that mask. You want that mask? OK. No, no, no, no, no, no! Quick, grab the mask! Oh, no. Bruce? What? Aw, is the party over? Nice. Dad? Daddy? Huh? Aah! Uhh! Uhh! - Barbara. - Uh-huh? Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please? And I'm going to need a few more cotton rolls. OK. Hello, little fella. Aah! Heh heh heh! Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life... out on the reef, and I saved him. So, has that Novocaine kicked in yet? I think so. We're ready to roll. Bubbles! My bubbles. He likes bubbles. Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh! - Bonjour. - Aah! Slow down, little fella. There's nothing to worry about. - He's scared to death. - I want to go home. Do you know where my dad is? Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store. Pet store? Yeah, you know, like, I'm from Bob's Fish Mart. - Pet Palace. - Fish-O-Rama. - Mail order. - Ebay. - So, which one is it? - I'm from the ocean. Ah, the ocean. The ocean? Aah! Aah! Aah! He hasn't been decontaminated. Jacques! - Oui. - Clean him! Oui. - Ocean. - Ooh, la mer. Bon. Voila. He is clean. Wow. The big blue. What's it like? - Big and blue? - I knew it. If there's anything you need, just ask your Auntie Deb. Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister Flo. Hi. How are you? Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's nuts. Ha ha ha ha! We got a live one. - Can't hear you, Peach. - I said we got a live one. - Boy, oh, boy. - What do we got? Root canal-and by the looks of those x-rays... it's not going to be pretty. Ow! - Dam and clamp installed? - Yep. - What did he use to open? - Gator-Glidden drill. He seems to favor that one lately. I can't see, Flo. You're getting a little too-Aah! Now he's doing the Schilder technique. He's using a Hedstrom file. That's not a Hedstrom file. That's a K-Flex. It has a teardrop cross-section. Clearly a Hedstrom. - No, no, K-Flex. - Hedstrom. - K-Flex! - Hedstrom! There I go. A little help, over here. I'll go deflate him. All right. Go ahead and rinse. Oh, the human mouth is a disgusting place. - Hey, Nigel. - What did I miss? Root canal-a doozy. Root canal? What did he use to open? - Gator-Glidden drill. - He's favoring that one. Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer at the portal terminus. - Hello. Who's this? - New guy. Ha ha ha! The dentist took him off the reef. An outie. From my neck of the woods, eh? Sorry if I ever took a snap at you. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat. Hey! No, no, no, no! They're not your fish. They're my fish. Come on, go. Go on, shoo! Aw, the picture broke. This here's Darla. She's my niece. She's going to be eight this week. Hey, little fella. Say hello to your new mummy. She'll be here Friday to pick you up. You're her present. Shh, shh, shh. It's our little secret. Well, Mr. Tucker, while that sets up... I'm going to see a man about a wallaby. Oh, Darla. What? What's wrong with her? She wouldn't stop shaking the bag. - Poor Chuckles. - He was her present last year. Hitched a ride on the porcelain express. She's a fish killer. I can't go with that girl. I have to get back to my dad. Aah! Daddy! Help me! Oh, he's stuck. Nobody touch him. Nobody touch him. Can you help me? No. You got yourself in there. You can get yourself out. - Gill- - I want to see him do it. Calm down. Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail. I can't. I have a bad fin. Never stopped me. Just think about what you need to do. Come on. Perfect. - Yay! - You did it! Good squirming. Ha ha ha! Wow. From the ocean- just like you, Gill. Yeah. What are you thinking about? I'm thinking... tonight, we give the kid a proper reception. So, kid, you got a name or what? Nemo. I'm Nemo. Nemo. Nemo. Are you gonna eat that? - Careful with that hammer. - Huh? No, no. What does it say? Dory! A sea monkey has my money. Wake up. Get up. Come on. Come on! - Yes, I'm a natural blue. - Get up! Look out! Sharks eat fish! Aah! - Aah! - Aah! Aah! Wow. Dusty. The mask. Where's the mask? No! No, not the mask! Get it! Get the mask! Get the mask! Get it! Hoo doot doo doot doot doo doot Whoo-hoo! La la la la la la It just keeps going on, doesn't it? Echo! Echo! Hey, what you doing? It's gone. I've lost the mask. - Did you drop it? - You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my son. Now it's gone. Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills... when life gets you down, know what you got to do? - I don't want to know. - Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming What do we do? We swim, swim Dory, no singing. Ho ho ho ho ho ho I love to swim When you want to swim See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song. - Now it's in my head. - Sorry. Dory, do you see anything? - Aah! Something's got me. - That was me. I'm sorry. - Who's that? - Who could it be? It's me. Are you my conscience? Yeah, yeah. I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you? - Can't complain. - Yeah? Good. Now, Dory, I want you to tell me- Do you see anything? I see a... I see a light. - A light? - Yeah. Over there. - Hey, conscience, am I dead? - No. I see it, too. What is it? It's so pretty. I'm feeling... happy... which is a big deal for me. I want to touch it. - Oh. - Ooh. Hey, come back. Come on back here. I'm gonna get you I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna swim with you I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna be your best friend Good feeling's gone. - Whoa! - Waah! I can't see! I don't know where I'm going! Haah! - The mask! - What mask? OK, I can't see a thing. - Oh, gee. - Hey, look, a mask. Read it! I'm sorry, but if you could just... bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light. That's great. Keep it right there. - Just read it! - OK, OK. Mr. Bossy. Uh, P. OK. P. Sher... Sher-P. Sher- P. Shirley? P.- Oh. The first line's P. Sherman. P. Sherman doesn't make any sense! OK. Second line. 42. Don't eat me. Don't eat me. Aah! Light, please! Walla-walla- Waah! Waah! Waah! The second line's Wallaby Way. That's great. Speed read. Take a guess. No pressure. No problem. There's a lot of pressure. Pressure! Take a guess now with pressure! - Sydney! It's Sydney! - Duck! Aah! I'm dead. I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead. I died. I'm dead. Whoo-hoo! We did it, we did it Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah No eating here tonight, whoo! Eating here tonight No, no, no, eating here tonight - Dory. - You on a diet Dory! What did the mask say? P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney. I usually forget things, but I remembered it! Whoa, whoa, wait. Where is that? I don't know. But who cares? I remembered. - Raar! - Aah! P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered it again! Psst. Nemo. Mmm... Nemo - Huh? - Suivez-moi. Follow me. Ha hwa ha Ha hwa ha ho ho ho Ha hwa ho ha Hahoo wahoo yahoo ho Hahoo ho ho wahoo ha hee Ha ho wahee ha ho ho ho Hoo! State your name. Nemo. Brother Bloat, proceed. Nemo, newcomer of orange and white... you have been called forth... to the summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie... to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood. - Huh? - We want you in our club, kid. - Really? - If... you are able to swim through... Turn on the Ring of Fire! You said you could do it. The Ring of Fire! Bubbles, let me-Oh! Ha hwa ha ho ho ho Isn't there another way? He's just a boy! From this moment on, you will be known as Sharkbait. Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha! Welcome, Brother Sharkbait. Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha! - Enough with the Sharkbait. - Sharkbait! Ooh... ba-ba-do. Sharkbait's one of us now, agreed? - Agreed. - We can't send him to his death. Darla's coming in five days. So, what are we going to do? I'll tell you what we're gonna do- we're gonna get him out of here. - We'll help him escape. - Escape? Really? We're all gonna escape. Gill, please. Not another escape plan. Sorry, but they just never work. Why should this be any different? - Because we've got him. - Me? - You see that filter? - Yeah. You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing. We need you to take a pebble inside there... and jam the gears. You do that, and this tank's gonna get... filthier and filthier by the minute. Pretty soon, the dentist'll have to clean the tank... and when he does, he'll take us out of the tank... put us in individual baggies... then we'll roll ourselves down the counter... out the window, off the awning... into the bushes, across the street... and into the harbor! It's foolproof. Who's with me? - Aye! - Aye! I think you're nuts. No offense, kid, but you're not the best swimmer. He's fine. He can do this. So, Sharkbait, what do you think? Let's do it. I'm going to P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where are you going? I'm going to P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney. If you ask where I'm going... I'll tell you that's where I'm going. It's P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where? I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney. Excuse me. Hi. Do you know how to get- Hello? Whoa. Wait. Can you tell me- Hey! Hold it! I'm trying to talk to you! Fellas, come back here. One quick question. I need to- And they're gone again. P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney. Why do I have to tell you over and over again? I'll tell you again. I don't get tired of it- - OK, all right. - Huh? - Here's the thing. - Uh-huh. I think it's best if I carry on from here by... by myself. OK. - You know, alone. - Uh-huh. Without-without- I mean, not without you. But I don't want you... with me. - Huh? - Am I... I don't want to hurt your feelings. - You want me to leave? - I mean, not-Yes. I just can't afford any more delays... and you're one of those fish that cause delays. Sometimes it's a good thing. There's a whole group of fish. They're delay fish. You mean... You mean you don't like me? No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated emotion. - Ohh! - Don't cry. I like you. Hey, you! Lady, is this guy bothering you? Um... I don't remember. Were you? No, no, no, no, no. We're just- Do you guys know how I can get to- Look, pal, we're talking to the lady, not you. Hey, hey. You like impressions? Mm-hmm. Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen. So what are we? Take a guess. Oh, oh. I've seen one of those. I'm a fish with a nose like a sword. - Wait, wait, um- - It's a swordfish! Hey, clown boy, let the lady guess. Where's the butter? Ooh! It's on the tip of my tongue! - Lobster. - Saw that! Lots of legs! Live in the ocean. - Clam! - Close enough! Oh, it's a whale of a tale I'll tell you, lad... They're good. Will somebody please give me directions?! - Ha ha ha ha ha! - I'm serious! Blah blah blah, me, me, blah! Blah blah blah, me, me, me! Thank you. Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back! - Hey, what's the matter? - What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions... I am miles from home with a fish that can't remember her name! I bet that's frustrating. Meanwhile, my son is out there. - Your son Chico? - Nemo? But it doesn't matter because no fish... in this entire ocean is going to help me. Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. - Guys! - Is he bothering you again? No, no. He's a good guy. Go easy on him. He's lost his son Fabio. Any of you heard of P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney? Sydney? Oh, sure! Ted here's got relatives in Sydney. - Don't you, Ted? - Sure do! Oh! Hey! They know Sydney! You wouldn't know how to get there, would you? You want to follow the E.A.C. That's the East Australian Current. Big current. Can't miss it. It's in... that direction. And then you follow that for about... I don't know. What do you guys think? About three leagues? That little baby will put you right past Sydney. - Ta-da! - That's great! Dory, you did it! Oh, please, I'm just your little helper. - Helping along. That's me. - Fellas, thank you. Don't mention it! Just loosen up, OK, buddy? Oh, you guys. You really nailed him. Bye. Oh, hey, ma'am. One more thing. When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it. Trench... through it, not over it. I'll remember. Hey, hey! Hey, wait up, partner! Hold on! Wait, wait, wait! I gotta tell you something. Whoa. Nice trench. Hello! - OK, let's go. - No, no. Bad trench. Come on, we'll swim over this thing. Whoa, partner. Little red flag going up. Something's telling me to swim through it, not over it. Are you looking at this thing? It's got death written all over it. I really, really, really think we should swim through. And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go. - Trust me on this. - Trust you? Yes, trust. It's what friends do. Look! Something shiny! - Where? - It just swam over the trench. - Come on, we'll follow it! - OK! Boy, it sure is clear up here. Exactly. And look at that- there's the current. We should be there in no time. Hey, little guy. You wanted to go through the trench. I shall call him Squishy, and he shall be mine. And he shall be my Squishy. Come here, Squishy. Come here, little Squishy. Ow! - That's a jellyfish! - Bad Squishy! Shoo, shoo! Get away! - Let me see that. - Don't touch it. I won't touch it. I just want to look. Hey! How come it didn't sting you? It did. It's just that- - Ow! Ow! Ow! - Hold still. I live in this anemone... and I'm used to these kind of stings. Ow! Ow! Ow! It doesn't look bad. You'll be fine. But now we know, don't we... that we don't want to touch these again. Let's be thankful this time it was just a little one. - Aah! - Aah! Don't move. - This is bad, Dory. - Hey, watch this! Boing! Boing! Dory! You can't catch me Don't bounce on the tops! They will... not sting you! - The tops don't sting you! - Two in a row! Beat that! Dory, listen to me. I have an idea-a game. - A game? - Yes. - I love games! Pick me! - Here's the game. Whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish wins! - OK. - Rules, rules, rules! You can't touch the tentacles. Only the tops. Something about tentacles. Got it. Go! Wait! Not something about 'em, it's all about 'em! - Whee! - Wait, Dory! Gotta go faster if you want to win! Whoa! Dory! Boing, boing, boing! Wait a minute! Whoa! Dory! Whee! We're cheating death now. That's what we're doing. But we're having fun at the same time. I can do this. Just be careful. Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win! I don't think so! Ha ha ha ha! Whoa! Give it up, old man. You can't fight evolution. I was built for speed. The question is, Dory, are you hungry? - Hungry? - Yeah. 'Cause you're about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left! Right there! The clownfish is the winner! Whoo-hoo! We did it! Look at us! Dory? Oh, no. Dory! Dory! Dory! Dory! Am I disqualified? No, you're doing fine! You're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake. Where does P. Sherman live? P. Sherman... Wallaby Way, Sydney... That's it! Uhh! - Wallaby Way... - Uhh! Stay awake! Stay awake! Ooh! Stay awake! Stay... awake! - Awake. - P. Sherman. - Awake. -42 Wallaby Way. Wake up. Nemo... You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait? Yeah. You're lucky to have someone out there looking for you. He's not looking for me. He's scared of the ocean. Peach, any movement? He's had four cups of coffee. It's gotta be soon. Keep on him. My first escape- landed on dental tools. I was aiming for the toilet. Toilet? All drains lead to the ocean, kid. Wow. How many times have you tried to get out? Ah, I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to you. Potty break! He grabbed the Reader's Digest. - We have 4.2 minutes! - That's your cue, Sharkbait. - You can do it, kid. - We gotta be quick. Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the chamber... and I'll talk you through the rest. - OK. - It'll be a piece of kelp. Nicely done! - Can you hear me? - Yeah! Here comes the pebble. Ptoo. Now, do you see a small opening? Uh-huh! Inside it, you'll see a rotating fan. Wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning. Aah! - Careful, Sharkbait! - I can't do it! Gill, this isn't a good idea. He'll be fine. Try again! OK. That's it, Sharkbait. Nice and steady. I got it! I got it! - He did it! - That's great, kid! Now swim up the tube and out. Oh, no! Gill! - Sharkbait! - Oh, my gosh! Get him outta there! - What do we do? - Oh, no! Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic! Help me! Sharkbait, grab hold of this! - No! No! No! - Feed me more! - That's it! - Sharkbait! Grab it! I got it! Pull! Gill, don't make him go back in there. No. We're done. Dude. - Uhh. - Dude. Focus, dude. Dude. Ohh. Oh, he lives. Hey, dude! Ohh. What happened? Saw the whole thing, dude. First, you were all, like, Whoa!... and then we were all, like, Whoa!... and then you were, like, Whoa. What are you talking about? You, mini-man. Takin' on the jellies. You got serious thrill issues, dude. - Ohh. - Awesome. Uhh. Oh, my stomach. Ohh! Oh, man. No hurlin' on the shell, dude, OK? Just waxed it. So, Mr. Turtle- Whoa, dude. Mr. Turtle is my father. The name's Crush. Crush? Really? OK, Crush. I need to the East Australian Current. E.A.C.? Oh, dude. You're ridin' it, dude! Check it out! OK, grab shell, dude! Grab wh-a-a-at?! Ha ha! Righteous! Righteous! - Yeah! - Stop! So... What brings you on this fine day to the E.A.C.? Dory and I need to get to Sydney. Dory! Is she all right? Huh? Oh, little blue. She is sub-level, dude. Dory! Dory! Dory! Dory. I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. It's my fault. Twenty-nine, thirty! Ready or not, here I come! There you are! Catch me if you can! Dory? Nice wave! Oh, wow! Heh heh. Up you go! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-oh-oh-oh! - Oh, my goodness! - Kill the motor, dude. Let us see what Squirt does flying solo. Whoa! Whoa! That was so cool! Hey, Dad, did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see what I did? You so totally rock, Squirt! So give me some fin. Noggin. - Dude. - Dude. Oh... intro. Jellyman, offspring. Offspring, Jellyman. - Jellies?! Sweet. - Totally. Apparently, I must've done something you liked... dudes. - You rock, dude! - Ow. Curl away, my son. It's awesome, Jellyman. The little dudes are just eggs. We leave 'em on a beach to hatch... and then, coo-coo-cachoo... they find their way back to the big ol' blue. - All by themselves? - Yeah. But, dude, how do you know when they're ready? Well, you never really know. But when they know, you'll know, you know? Ha. Hey, look, everybody. I know that dude! It's the Jellyman! Go on. Jump on him! - Turtle pile! - Wait, wait, wait! - Are you funny? - Where's your shell? - I need to breathe! - Are you running away? Did you really cross the jellyfish forest? - Did they sting you? - One at a time! Mr. Fish, did you die? Sorry, I was a little vague on the details. So, where are you going? You see, my son was taken. My son was taken away from me. - No way. - What happened? No, no, kids. I don't want to talk about it. Aww! Please? Please? Well, OK. I live on this reef a long, long way from here. This is gonna be good. I can tell. And my son Nemo... See, he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it... if I hadn't been so tough on him. I don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat... and when he was out there, these divers appeared... and I tried to stop them, but the boat was too fast. So, we swam out in the ocean to follow them... They couldn't stop 'em. And then Nemo's dad... he swims out to the ocean, and they bump into... ...three ferocious sharks. He scares away the sharks by blowing 'em up! Golly, that's amazing. And then dives thousands of feet... ...straight down into the dark. It's wicked dark down there. You can't see a thing. How's it going, Bob? And the only thing they can see down there... ...is the light from this big, horrible creature... with razor-sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man. And then he has to blast his way... So, these two little fish have been... searching the ocean for days on the East Australian Current. Which means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put him in Sydney Harbor... ...in a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like... this guy is gonna stop at nothing... ...till he finds his son. I sure hope he makes it. That's one dedicated father, if you ask me. Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Would you just shut up?! You're rats with wings! Bloke's been looking for his boy Nemo. - Nemo?! - He was taken off the reef... - Take it! You happy? - Mine! Mine! Mine! Hey, say that again! Something about Nemo. Mine! Mine! Mine! Whoooa... Hyah! Mine? Last I heard, he's heading towards the harbor. Ho ho! Brilliant! Is he doing OK? Whatever you do, Don't mention D-a-r- It's OK. I know who you're talking about. Gill? Gill? Hey, Sharkbait. I'm sorry I couldn't stop the- No, I'm the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out... so ready to taste that ocean... I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there. Nothing should be worth that. I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid. All right. Hey, hey, hey- - What the- - Aaah! That's one way to pull a tooth. Huh. Darn kids. Good thing I pulled the right one, eh, Prime Minister? Hey, psst! Oh, Nigel! You just missed an extraction. Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet? What am I talking about? Where's Nemo? - I've got to speak with him. - What is it? Your dad's been fighting the entire ocean... - looking for you. - My father? Really? He's traveled hundreds of miles, battling sharks and jellyfish- Sharks? That can't be him. What was his name? Some sort of sport fish. - Tuna? Trout? - Marlin? Marlin! The little clownfish from the reef. It's my dad! He took on a shark! I heard he took on three. - Three sharks? - That's 4,800 teeth! After you were taken by Diver Dan over there... your dad followed the boat like a maniac. Really? He's swimming, giving it all he's got... and then three gigantic sharks capture him... and he blows them up and dives thousands of feet... and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth! He ties this demon to a rock, and what's his reward? He gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest! Now he's with a bunch of sea turtles on the E.A.C... and the word is he's headed this way right now... to Sydney! - Wow! - What a good daddy! He was looking for you after all, Sharkbait. He's swimming to the filter! - Sharkbait! - Not again! Sharkbait! No! You got your whole life ahead of you! - We'll help you, kid! - Get him out! Get him out of there! Come on, kid! Grab the end! Sharkbait! - No! - Can you hear me? Nemo! Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Sharkbait, you did it! Sharkbait, you're... covered with germs! Aah! Ha ha! That took guts, kid. All right, gang, we have less than hours... before Darla gets here. This tank'll get plenty dirty in that time... but we have to help it along any way we can. - Jacques? No cleaning. - I shall resist. Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're gonna make this tank so filthy... the dentist will have to clean it. - Good work! - Ha ha ha! All right, we're here, dudes! Get ready! Your exit's coming up, man! Where? I don't see it! Right there! I see it! I see it! The swirling vortex of terror? - That's it, dude. - Of course it is. OK, first, find your exit buddy. Do you have your exit buddy? Yes! Squirt give you a rundown of proper exiting technique. Good afternoon! We'll have a great jump today! OK, crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall. There's a screaming bottom turn, so watch out! Remember- rip it, roll it, and punch it! He's trying to speak to me, I know it! You're really cute, but I don't know what you're saying! Say the first thing again. OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go! - Whoa! - Wahoo! - Whoa! - Whoa! Whoo! That was... fun! I actually enjoyed that. Hey, look, turtles! Ha ha! Most excellent! Now turn your fishy tails around... and swim straight on through to Sydney! No worries, man! No worries! Thank you, dude Crush! - Bye! - Bye, Jellyman! You tell your little dude I said hi, OK? See ya later, dudes! Bye, everyone! Nemo would have loved this. Ooh! Hey! Crush, I forgot! How old are you? 150, dude! And still young! Rock on! 150! 150! I gotta remember that. Whoa. - We going in there? - Yep. P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney? Yep. We're gonna just swim straight. Just keep swimming, just keep swimming Dory... Boy, this is taking awhile. How about we play a game? OK. OK, I'm thinking of something orange... and it's small- - It's me. - Right! It's orange and small- It's me. All righty, Mr. Smartypants. And it's orange and small and white stripes- Me. And the next one, just a guess, me. - That's just scary. - Wait, wait, wait. I have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we've passed it before... and that means we're going in circles... and that means we're not going straight! - Hey, hey! - Get to the surface. We'll figure it out up there. Let's go! - Hey! Relax. - What? Take a deep breath. Now, let's ask somebody for directions. Fine. Who do you want to ask, the speck? - There's nobody here! - There has to be someone. It's the ocean, silly. We're not the only two in here. Let's see. OK, no one there. Nope. Nada. There's somebody. Hey! Excuse- Dory, Dory, Dory! Now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious. It's a fish we don't know. If we ask it directions... it could ingest us and spit out our bones! What is it with men and asking for directions? I don't want to play the gender card right now. Let's play the Let's Not Die card. - You want to get out of here? - Of course I do. How are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot? Dory, you don't fully understand- Come on. Trust me on this. All right. Excuse me! Whoo-hoo! Little fella? Hello! Don't be rude. Say hi. Ha. Hello. - His son Bingo- - Nemo. - Nemo was taken to- - Sydney. Sydney! And it's really, really important... that we get there as fast as we can... so can you help us out? Come on, little fella. Come on. Dory, I'm a little fella. I don't think that's a little fella. Oh! Big fella. Whale. OK. Maybe he only speaks whale. Mooo! Weee neeed... - Dory? - Tooo fiind his son. What are you doing? Are you sure you speak whale? Can youuuu give us diiirectionsss? Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying! - See, he's swimming away. - Cooome baaack. He's not coming back. You offended him. Maybe a different dialect. - Moooohhhmmooo... - Dory! This is not whale. You're speaking upset stomach. - Maybe I should try humpback. - Don't. Wooooooo... - You actually sound sick. - Maybe louder? - Rah! Rah! - Don't do that! Too much orca. Didn't it sound orca-ish? It doesn't sound orca. It sounds like nothing I've ever heard. - Oooooo! - Ohh! It's just as well. He might be hungry. Whales don't eat clownfish. They eat krill. Swim away! - Oh, look, krill! - Aah! - Aah! Look at that. Would you look at that? Filthy. Absolutely filthy. All thanks to you, kid. You made it possible. Jacques, I said no cleaning. I am ashamed. Look! Scum angel! Ooh! Aaah! Bubbles! I love the bubbles! Flo? Has anybody seen Flo? 9:00 and cue dentist. Hello, Barbara. Sorry I'm late. OK, here we go. Here we go, OK. Little Davey Reynolds... Walks to the counter, drops the keys... Bloat, that's disgusting! Tastes pretty good to me. - Urrrp! - Eww! Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own- Shh! Here he comes! Aah! Crikey. What a state. Ohh. Barbara, what's my earliest appointment tomorrow? -10:00, luv. - Leave it open, would you? I've gotta clean the fish tank before Darla gets here. Did you hear that, Sharkbait? Yay! He's gonna clean the tank! We're gonna be clean! You ready to see your dad, kid? - Uh-huh. - Of course you are. I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there... in the harbor waiting for you right now. Yeah. Aaah! Oof! Whoo! Yaahhh! Here comes the big one. Ooh! Come on! You gotta try this! - Will you just stop it? - Why? What's wrong? We're in a whale, don't you get it? - Whale? - A whale! You had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here! Wow, a whale. I speak whale. No, you're insane! You can't speak whale! I have to get out! I have to find my son! I have to tell him how old sea turtles are! Ohhh! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Hey... you OK? There, there. It's all right. It'll be OK. No. No, it won't. Sure it will. You'll see. No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him. Huh. That's a funny thing to promise. What? You can't never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him. Not much fun for little Harpo. - Hmm. - What's going on? Don't know. I'll ask him. - Dory... - Whaaat's goooing onnn? I think he says we've stopped. Of course we've stopped. Stop trying to speak whale. You'll make things worse. What is that noise? Oh, no. Look what you did. The water's going down. It's going down! Really? You sure about that? Look! Already it's half empty! I'd say it's half full. Stop that! It's half empty! OK, that one was a little tougher. He either said we should go to the back of the throat... or he wants a root beer float. Of course he wants us to go there! That's eating us! How do I taste, Moby? Do I taste good? Tell him I'm not interested in being lunch! - OK. Heee- - Stop talking to him! - Aah! - Aah! What is going on? I'll check. Whaaat- No more whale! You can't speak whale! - Yes, I can! - No, you can't! You think you can do these things, but you can't, Nemo! - OK. - Dory! Oof! He says it's time to let go. Everything's gonna be all right. How do you know? How do you know something bad isn't gonna happen? I don't! - Aah! - Aah! Ha ha ha! We're alive! Look! Sy-d-ney-Sydney! Sydney! Sydney again! You were right, Dory! We made it! We're gonna find my son! Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr! Wow. I wish I could speak whale. All we gotta do is find the boat that took him. - Right! - We can do this! Morning. It's morning, everyone! Today's the day! The sun is shining, the tank is clean... and we are getting out- The tank is clean. The tank is clean! But how? Boss must've installed it while we were sleeping. - What are we gonna do? - What's it say, Peach? I can't hear you, Peach. The Aquascum is an all-purpose, self-cleaning... maintenance-free, salt water purifier... that is guaranteed to extend the life of your aquarium fish. Stop it! The Aquascum is programmed to scan... your tank environment every five minutes?! Scan? What does that mean? Aah! Temperature-82 degrees... PH balance-normal. - Ooh. - Nice. Ooh-Oh! Curse you, Aquascum! That's it for the escape plan. It's ruined. Then what are we gonna do about- Darla! Stay down, kid! - False alarm. - Whew. My nerves can't take much more of this. What'll we do when that brat gets here? - I'm thinking. - Oh! Gill! - Nemo! I'm coming! - Help me! Help me! Swim down! Come on, kid! - Everybody jump in! - Swim down! - That's it! - What the-? - Yay! - Ha ha! Good work! Gill! - Nemo! - Sharkbait! - Roll, kid! - Lean! Lean! Whoops. That would've been a nasty fall. Gill! Don't let me go belly-up! Just calm down, Nemo. You won't go belly-up. I promise. You're gonna be OK. Darla! Do any of these boats look familiar to you? No, but the boat has to be here somewhere. Come on, Dory. We're gonna find it. I'm totally excited. Are you excited? Dory, wake up. Wake up, come on. Duck! That's not a duck. It's a... pelican! - Whoa! - Aah! - Whoa! - Aah! No! I didn't come this far to be breakfast! Hey, Nigel. Would you look at that? What? What? Sun's barely up and Gerald's had more than he can handle. Yeah. Reckon somebody ought to help the poor guy. Yeah, right. Yeah. Don't everybody fly off at once. All right, Gerald. Fish got your tongue? - Aah! - Love a duck! I gotta find my son Nemo! Nemo?

Truly, I am. - Hey. - Dory... if it wasn't for you... I never would've even made it here. So, thank you. Hey, wait a minute. Wait. Where are you going? It's over, Dory. We were too late. Nemo's gone, and I'm going home now. No. No, you can't. Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. And if you leave, I just... I remember things better with you. I do. Look- P. Sherman, 42... 42... I remember it. I do. It's there. I know it is because when I look at you... I can feel it. I look at you and I... I'm home.

31,2005,"Good Night, and Good Luck",American,"Set in 1953, during the early days of television broadcast journalism. Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) along with his news team, producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney) and reporter Joseph Wershba (Robert Downey, Jr.) learn of U.S. Air Force officer Milo Radulovich, who is being forcibly discharged because of family members being known communists, and he refused to denounce them. Interest is piqued when it is found that the compilation of charges at Radulovich's hearing was in a sealed envelope and nobody saw them. Murrow presents the story to CBS News' director, Sig Mickelson (Jeff Daniels), who warns Murrow that the story will bring serious accusations and repercussions to CBS and their sponsors, some of whom have government contracts. He reluctantly allows the story to air, which gains positive responses from the public. Murrow also tries to ease the worries of his colleague, Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise), who is struggling with both the strain of his recent divorce and attacks from newspaper writer Jack O'Brian, who is accusing him of being biased in his news reporting and being a ""pinko"".
Soon after, Wershba's given an envelope suggesting that Murrow has previously interacted with the Soviets and used to be on their payroll. CBS's Chief Executive, William Paley (Frank Langella) brings this forward to Murrow, warning him that if any members of his staff are associated with communism in any way, however remotely, they would have to recuse themselves from Murrow's next story, which is a direct attack on Senator Joseph McCarthy and his crusade against Communist infiltration in the U.S. government, which some denounce as a witch hunt. Friendly and Murrow gather their staff together, and when one of the team members voluntarily excuses himself because his ex-wife had attended Communist meetings before they even met, Murrow concludes that this kind of fear is what McCarthy wants. The team stays together and presents the story, which becomes highly praised by the public and the press, with the exception of Jack O'Brian, who continues to attack both Murrow and especially Hollenbeck on their supposed support of Communism. Hollenbeck pleads with Murrow to go after O'Brian, but Murrow reluctantly tells him that he cannot attack O'Brian while he is busy going after McCarthy.
As the team turns their focus to a filmed hearing of Annie Lee Moss, a Pentagon communication worker accused of being a communist based on her name appearing on a list seen by an FBI infiltrator of the American Communist Party, they receive the news that Milo Radulovich being reinstated by the Air Force, citing no evidence supporting any connections with Communism. Soon after, McCarthy asks for the opportunity to speak for himself on Murrow's show, which Murrow allows. McCarthy openly accuses Murrow of being a Communist, citing several pieces of evidence that seem to support it. Murrow broadcasts a rebuttal the following week, easily disproving McCarthy's accusations and pointing out that McCarthy didn't do anything to defend himself other than accuse anyone who opposes him as being either a Communist or a Communist sympathizer.
A few days later, the news arrives that the U.S. Senate is investigating McCarthy, which means the imminent end of his crusade. As the team celebrates, Friendly and Murrow learn that Hollenbeck has committed suicide. Soon after, Paley tells Murrow and Friendly that their news program's air time is going to be severely cut, citing the high costs of the show's production, along with Murrow's attacks on controversial topics. Also, Joe Wershba and his wife Shirley, who both have been secretly hiding their marriage, due to CBS forbidding co-workers being married, are approached by Mickelson, who tells them that everyone knows of their marriage and that he will allow one of them to resign to save face, which Joe agrees to do.
The film is framed by performance of the speech given by Murrow to the Radio and Television News Directors Association at ""A Salute to Edward R. Murrow"" on October 25, 1958, in which he harshly admonishes his audience not to squander the potential of television to inform and educate the public, so that it does not become only ""wires and lights in a box"".[2]",7.4,tt0433383,"In 1935, Ed Murrow began his career with CBS. When World War Two broke out... ...his voice brought the battle of Britain home to us... ...through his ""This Is London"" radio series. He started with us all... ...many of us here tonight, when television was in its infancy... ...with the news documentary show, ""See It Now'. He threw stones at giants. Segregation, exploitation of migrant workers... ...apartheid, J. Edgar Hoover... ...not the least of which, his historical fight with Senator McCarthy. He is the host of our enormously popular show ""Person to Person""... ...and tonight he is here with his son, Casey... ...wife, Janet, and all of you who he's worked with... ...inspired, lectured, and taught. Ladies and gentlemen... ...the Radio-Television News Directors' Association and Foundation welcomes... ...Mr. Edward R. Murrow. This might just do nobody any good. At the end of this discourse a few people may accuse this reporter... ...of fouling his own comfortable nest... ...and your organization may be accused of having given hospitality... ...to heretical and even dangerous ideas. But the elaborate structure of networks... ...advertising agencies, and sponsors will not be shaken or altered. It is my desire, if not my duty, to try to talk to you journeymen... ...with some candor about what is happening to radio andtelevision. And if what I say is responsible... ...I alone am responsible for the saying ofit. Our history will be what we make of it. And if there are any historians about or years from now... ...and there should be preserved... ...the kinescopes of one week of all three networks... ...they will there find recorded in black and white, and in color... ...evidence of decadence, escapism... ...and insulation from the realities of the world in which we live. We are currently wealthy, fat, comfortable, and complacent. We have a built-in allergy to unpleasant or disturbing information. Our mass media reflect this. But unless we get up off our fat surpluses... ...and recognize that television in the main... ...is being used to distract, delude, amuse, and insulate us... ...then television and those who finance it... ...those who look at it and those who work at it... ...may see atotally different picture too late. Millie! Just the person I wanted to see! Come here! This goes at the top of the Roy Campanella piece. Yes! Give me a half an hour. I may need it a little quicker than that! - Can I get some coffee first? - Come on! Get me some coffee! Morning, Johnny! I have some new notes that go with the Tito footage for Fred. Fred's gonna be in in an hour. I already put them on his desk. Can you just make sure that... ...he doesn't look at the film until he reads the notes? - Yes. - Thank you. Hey, Joe! Shirley! - What's going on in here? - What do you mean? Two attractive people alone in the copy room! Don't tell Paley, he'll fire me. He'll fire both of us, Shirley. - Rules are made to be broken! - You can afford to say that. Let me see this. - It's simply a loyalty oath. - To CBS? - And to America. You promise to be a loyal American? I know. All of the reporters have signed this. Who are you promising this to? CBS? Fred signed it. Murrow signed it. - Murrow signed it? - Yeah. Are you now or have you ever been... I thought it was a joke, but there's a lot of pressure. ...on the Attorney General's list of subversive groups? - I don't know. - Let's think about it. What is it really saying? Is it a civil liberties issue or censorship? Am I simply stating to CBS that I'm not a Communist? - Murrow signed this? - And Fred and Stanton. - Maybe you should talk toMurrow. - Maybe I should sign it. If you don't sign this, are you and I a target? If I don'tsign it, they'll fire me. Sign it. Finally we can tell everyone the truth. If I could express it in what's in my heart now... ...I'd do it in the terms of the poet who once said... ...""Ah, 'tis but a dainty flower I bring to you."" 'Yes, 'tis but a violet..."" ""...glistening with dew."" ""But still in its heart there lie beauties concealed."" ""So in our heart..."" ""...our love for you..."" ""...lies unrevealed."" I used to... ...pride myself on the idea that I was a bit... tough... ...especially over the past 19-19 months, when we've been... ...kicked around, and bullwhipped, and damned. I didnt think that... ...I could be... touched very deeply. Okay, that's enough. That's enough, Leo. - It's short. - Howlong is the piece? It's minutes, but we can cut it down. It cant stand alone, but it might be a nice companion piece. Let's go through this one more time. Palmer! Yep, got a call from the office of Senator Morse this morning... ...interested in setting up a debate possibly with Senator Kerr... ...over the comments Bentsen made on last night's show. Secretary of Agriculture? Good idea! Can they do it by this week? No, it would have to be weeks at the earliest... ...depending on Morse's schedule. But still it's a great idea. Let's follow up on that. ""Hoover speaks on Benjamin Franklin."" We're having better luck with Mr. Benjamin Frankin... ...than with Mr. Hoover. It may progress better as a ""Person to Person"". ""At home with Ben Frankin. His electricity awards."" We've got the footage, we need to contact him. See if you can contact him and get the shot. He wants to do the story. Joe! Member Delbert Clark? No longer with us. - New York Times? - Yeah. - Our friend at the Times. This was yesterday morning, they're saying it's... - How old was he? - 53. Sudden illness. - Home of a friend. - No, it's not a nobit piece. Natalie send some flowers over there from us. Couple things. Case before the Supreme Court... ...involving the constitutionality of a section of the Internal Security Act... ...provides for the deportation of any alien... ...if he becomes a Communist after entering this country. Can you take this? All right. McCarthy interrupting his wedding trip... ...to take charge of the investigation of Communist infiltration... - Natalie, send some flowers. - Poor Mrs. McCarthy! May I finish? It's national security! - A real ladies' man! - Well, they're in love. We have no show for Tuesday, fellows. So get out there and make some news. Rob a bank. Mug an old lady. Do something. - You look at the Secretary Stevens footage? - We will. Watch it all the way to the end, it's worth it. Thank you, John. There's notmuch there. I can't tie it to the Eisenhower in the back of the train piece. - You ever spend any time in Detroit, Fred? - Not recently. There's a story here in the Detroit News, Dexter, Michigan. A kid named Milo Radulovich. - Italian? - Irish. Air Force kicked him out because his dad... ...reads ome Serbian newspaper. - Was he a Communist? - I don't know. - Who brought the charges? - Air Force. Charges were in a sealed envelope, nobody saw them. - Not even at the hearing? - He was declared guilty without a trial... ...and told if he wanted to keep his job... ...he had to denounce his father and his sister. Thank you, Natalie. - His sister? - He told them to take a hike. Let's send Joe and Charlie down there, see if he's any good on camera. Is he being brought before the Committee? No. Then it's not McCarthy. Isn't it? Milo Radulovich. What happens to your children... ...your 5-year-old and your 5-month-old in terms of you? If I am being judged on my relatives... ...are my children going to be asked to denounce me? Are they going to be judged on what their father was labeled? Are they going to have to explain to their friends, etc... ...why their father is a security risk? If the thing is let stand as it, the first recommendation... ...was sent out by the board, I see a chain reaction that... ...has no end to anybody, for anybody. Well, that's new. You can't call this a neutral piece. The other side's been represented rather well for the last years. The Air Force hasn't gone on the record. So you want to forego the standards you've stuck to for years... ...both sides, no commentary. - We all editorialize. - I'm just making sure we identify what... We're giving them the information up front... ...and we're asking them to comment on it. Frank, hold on. I've searched my conscience. I can't for the life of me find any justification for this. I simply cannot accept that there are, on every story... ...two equal and logical sides to an argument. - Call it editorializing, if you'd like. - It is editorializing. They'll have equal time to defend themselves. Do you understand the position you're putting us in? We are all in this together, if the Senate wants to investigate... Do me a favor... ...avoid any big speeches about how we're all in a big boat together! Please, don't insult me. I have to go back to Mr. Paley and Alcoa, who sponsors your show... ...and also have some military contracts... ...and I have to tell them that they're going to be in a tough bind... ...because of a beef you had with Joe McCarthy. - We're not going at McCarthy. - You're starting the goddamn fire. Excuse me. Mr. Friendly, there's a Colonel Anderson to see you? - Colonel? - He's in your office. There are two of them. Maybe they liked the transcript, and want to compliment us on it. Excuse me. Go after Joe Kennedy. We'll pay for it. I've got a great story about Hoover. You know how many shows you're going to have to do... ...to make up for this? - And Judy and her daughter Liza next week. No, no. You're interviewing Rin Tin Tin! I'll talk to Mr. Paley. Alcoa wont pay for the ads. And we probably wont either. But nobody'll stop you. How much are the ads? - 3,000. - I'll split it with Fred. He just won't have Christmas presents for his kids this year. - He's a Jew. - Don't tell him that, he loves Christmas. - To be clear, you did speak with the lawyers? - Yes, we did. And we read the transcript. We've not been allowed to see the footage. Mack is on a plane from Dexter right now with the last interviews. We'll be going right down to the wire. Your show airs tomorrow. How can we possibly approve and check... ...your story in the limited amount of time you have given us? With all due respect, you have been invited to participate in this piece... ...not to approve it. We are going with the story that says that the U.S. Air Force... ...tried Milo Radulovich without any evidence... ...and found him guilty of being a security risk... ...without his Constitutional rights... - You have not seen the evidence... ...and are claiming he's not a security risk. Wouldn't you guess that those who have seen the contents of that envelope... ...might have a better idea of what makes someone a danger to his country? - Who? Who? - Or do you think it should just be you that decides? Who are the people? Are they elected? Are they appointed? Do they have an axe to grind? Is it you, sir? Or you, Colonel Jenkns? Do you know the contents of that sealed envelope? We have been a friend and ally of both Mr. Murrow and CBS News for many years. The story you are going to run tomorrow is without merit. So before you take any steps that cannot be undone... ...I strongly urge you to reconsider your stand. These are very dangerous waters you are attempting to navigate. We have had no hearing at all. We have had noday in court. In all the years that I have been a practicing attorney in Detroit... ...I have never witnessed such a farce and travesty upon justice... ...as this thing has developed. - Now this whole theory... - Eddie, just take the first reel. Tell John I left seconds extra leader. seconds! I got it! Palmer, where's Joe? Have you seen Joe? He's on his way to the control room. We're gonna have to do the voice-over live. Natalie, I need a booth with a live mic. Booth is there, it's already set. We didn't have time to sync the voice-over out. That's not what I asked for. It's missing the voice-over on the last piece. There's a commercial in the booth. What shall I do? - minutes to air! - There's not supposed to be a commercial! Get himout of the booth! 2-and-a-half minutes on the end piece. Keep it down, please. It's a little loud. minutes to air, fellas. - He's gonna add a joke. - Charlie, loan me your lighter. Make sure you know that I swap with those two pieces of parents. - As long as he talks fast because... - He will talk fast. We got the film. Will it be ready? You bet. Funny thing, Freddy! Every time you light a cigarette for me, I know you're lying. It occurs t ome we might not get away with this one. Alcoa, the aluminum company of America... - seconds. - You fellas, ready? Okay. Ready on camera 1. 5, 4,3, 2. Pan, camera 1. Good evening. A few weeks ago there occurred a few obscure notices in the newspapers... ...about Milo Radulovich... ...a lieutenant in the Air Force Reserves. And, also, something about Air Force regulation 35-62... ...which states that a man may be regarded as a security risk... ...if he has close and continuing association with Communists... ...or people believed to have Communist sympathies. Lieutenant Radulovich was asked to resign in August. He declined. A board was called and heard his case. At the end it was recommended that he be severed from the Air Force... ...although it was also stated that there was no question whatever... ...as to the Lieutenant's loyalty. We propose to examine, in so far as we can... ...the case of Lieutenant Radulovich. Our reporter, Joe Wershba, cameraman, Charlie Mack. This is the town of Dexter, Michigan. Population 1500. This statue is at the end of Ann Arbor Street erected by... What did the General tell you yesterday? - A Colonel. There were two of them. - That makes a General. They weren't too pleased. You're gonna get audited this year. Not me, you. I told them I didn't want to do the story. - You always were yellow. - Better than red. In seconds. This is the sister, Margaret Radulovich Fishman. She neither defends nor explains her political activities. I feel that my activities, be what they may... ...or my political beliefs are my own private affair. Are my children going to be asked to denounce me? Are they going to be judged on what their father was labeled? Are they going to have to explain to their friends, etc... ...why their father is a security risk? I see, absolutely, that this is a chain reaction. If the thing is let stand as it, the first recommendation... ...was sent out by the board I see a chain reaction... ...that has no end to anybody, for anybody. Perhaps you will permit me to read a few sentences... ...because I would like to say rather precisely what I mean. We have told the Air Force that we will provide facilities... ...for any comments, criticisms, or corrections it may wish to make... ...as to the case of Milo Radulovich. We are unable to judge the charges against his father or sister... ...because neither we, nor you, nor they, nor the lawyers... ...nor the Lieutenant, know what was contained in that manila envelope. Was it hearsay, rumor, gossip, slander... ...or hard ascertainable facts that could be backed by credible witnesses? We do not know. We believe the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father. Even though that iniquity be proved and in this case it was not. But we believe too that this case illustrates the urgent need... ...for the Armed Forces to communicate more fully than they have so far done... ...the procedures and regulations to be followed... ...in attempting to protect the national security... ...and the rights of the individual at the same time. Whatever happens in this area of the relationship... ...between the individual and the state... ...we will do it ourselves... ...it cannot be blamed on Malenkov or Mao Tse-Tung or even our allies. And, it seems to us, Fred Friendly and myself... ...that this is a subject that should be argued about endlessly. Good night, and good luck. And we'reout. May I tell you something about yourself... May I tellyou something about yourself... ...as a member of the ""Person to Person"" audience? Based on audience research studies... ...you are well above average in education and intelligence. Your interests are wide, from world affairs and science... ...to sports and show business. And you have one characteristic that's rather encouraging to me... ...and that's the fact that you are not easily persuaded by advertising. The makers of Kent considered all these characteristics... ...when they chose Mr. Murrow'sprogram... ...to tell you about Kent. Of all leading filter cigarettes, Kent filter's best. If you try Kent with that in mind, I think you'll agree... ...with many other thinking people who havec hanged to Kent. They find that it makes good sense to smoke Kent and good smoking, too. - Did you get the changes? - Edward Murrow, ""Person to Person""... ...on the CBS Television Network. - No, no. You there? Okay. We got it. Now back to Ed Murrow. Not since the silent movies and the idols they produced... ...has Hollywood witnessed the sort of pilgrimage that is now going on. Each day, oblivious to time, weather, and the state of the world... ...sightseers head in the direction of California's San Fernando Valley. For there, at the end of the tourist line, is Sherman Oaks... ...and the home Liberace has built for himself and his mother. This is the front and nobody knows how many people have seen that view. This is the back of the house and that's Liberace's bedroom. - Good evening, Lee. - Good evening, Ed. - What are you doing? - I'm dictating my weekly syndicated newspaper column... ...and on my trusty tape recorder here, I'm also dictating a book. - It's an inspirational book. - Lee, what about you? Have you given much thought to getting married and settling down? Actually, I've given a lot of thought to it... ...but I don't believe in getting married just for the sake of getting married. I want to someday find the perfect mate... ...and settle down to what I hope will be a marriage that will be blessed... ...by faith and will be a lasting union. I was reading about lovely young Princess Margaret... ...and she's lookng for her dream man, too... ...and I hope she finds him someday. Uh-huh. Lee, thanks very much for letting us come and visit you. It's been very pleasant. And will you say goodnight to your family for us? - I certainly will. - Thanks a lot. - Good night, Ed. - Good night, Lee. Next week, we'll take you to Beverly Hills, California... ...to the house of Mickey Rooney and his newbride. Until then, good night, and good luck. Good show, Mr. Murrow! Excuse me, Mr. Murrow. Could you take a look at this and sign it for me, please? Thank you. Dr. Stanton would like to have a drink with you. - When? - Now. He's at the Pentagon Bar. I can't. What the hell is he doing there? - I believe he's waiting for you. - Just call him! - Fine. - Oppenheimer next week. - It's a good show, Ed. - Hey, Don! - Ed! You're getting good at this! They're gonna think you like it! Pays the bills. How are you, Don? Ah, it's... ...day today. If she saw how good you look right now, she'd be back. You tell her that if you see her, will you? - I read the O'Brian piece. - Yeah, it's tough. I'm a pinko. I slant the news. I'm just waiting for him to say my wife left me too. - Nobody worth their salt reads him. - You read him. Well, see, I rest my case. - Does Paley read him? - Bill Paley's not gonna do anything. Thanks, Ed. I just came by to tell you how great the Lieutenant piece was. - Thanks. - How's the fallout? - Mostly good, surprisingly. Is this the start? Are you taking sides? It's just a little poke with a stick, see what happens. You let me know if I can help. But you're a pinko. I'll see you. Hey, Joe! What's all this Radulovich junk you're putting out? I can't talk to you now. I have to get this film back to New York. What would you say if I told you... ...that Murrow was on the Soviet payroll in 1935? - Uh! Charlie, you wanna... - Sure. I'll set up outside. McCarthy going tot he Eisenhower dinner? - I have no idea. Id on't keep the Senator's calendar for him! - Really? Have you ever seen any spy films? You don't hand me a classified folder! You're supposed to slip it into my briefcase! I didnt know who to give this information to, Paley or Murrow. As you can imagine, Fred and I aren't very friendly. No pun intended. No pun elocuted. - What do you got, Donald? - In short? Murrows been a Communist sympathizer since the 1930's. Member of the International Workers, sponsored educational trips to Moscow... ...and on the Sovietpayroll in 1935. It's all there. You wanna know why that's not possible? Why you'll lose this one? Because everyone in this country... ...knows that Ed Murrow is a loyal American, he's apatriot. Did you know the word ""gullible"" isn't in the dictionary? - Can I give this to him? - I'd love it! I have copies! I think you guys go too far. Well, if it walks like a duck, talks like a duck. Yes, Mr. Paley. Right away. Yes, sir. No, he hasn't called. Yes, sir, the second he calls. If you're in a meeting, shall I? Yes, sir. Of course, sir. Mr. Murrow! Mr. Paley will see you now. - Mr. Paley, Mr. Murrow is here. - Thanks, Miss Mary. - Hello, Ed. - Bill... - Sit over here, will you? How's Janet? - Your son? - All well, thanks. How's Babe? She's fine. Her fundraiser got rained on, so... - Oh! That's why I never plan on anything. - Really? You'd never know. Reading fiction? I hope so. You tell me. Now we know how they're gonna come at us. That's just the first shot. Somebody's going to go down. Have you checked your facts? Are you on safe ground? - Bill, it's time. Show our cards. - My cards. You lose, what happens? guys find themselves out of work. I'm responsible for a lot more than goddamn reporters. Let it go. McCarthy will self-destruct, Cohn, all of them. You said Corporate would not interfere with Editorial... ...and that the News was to be left... We don't make the news, we report the news. He's marked as Communists. If he goes too far, the Senate will investigate him... ...and we will report on that. He oversteps people's civil liberties. And you're trying him in the press? Does he get the right to face his accuser? You've decided on this and you're presenting it as fact. - What I am doing... - I write your check. I put you in your country house, and I put your son through school! You should have told me about this before it went so far down the road! Everyone of your boys needs to be clean. Do you understand? No ties. If Aaron's mother went to a group fundraiser in 1932, he's out. Hewitt, too. Anyone in that room. You make no mistake... ...I will cut them loose. Corporate won't interfere with Editorial. But Editorial will not jeopardize the hundreds of employees... ...of the CBS. Do I make myself clear? Yes? Fellas, our next show is gonna be about Senator McCarthy. And we'regonna go right at him. I don't need to tell you how careful we have to be. If we are to do this, Ed and I need you to be straight with us. We need to know, for the good of the piece... ...if any of you have any connection, if you subscribed to a newsletter... ...if you attended a party, anything... ...anything that could compromise this, anything at all... ...because now would be the time to tell us. Ed, I think I should excuse myself. Palmer, you kidding? My ex was a... I wouldn't say she was a Communist... ...but she attended meetings. It was before we were married. I didn't even really know about it until after the divorce. But it was different then. We were all on the same side. I'm not telling you anything you don't know. The thing is... ...somebody'll find out. They'll hurt us with it. I should have told you sooner, Ed, I'm sorry. Fred. If none of us had ever read a ""dangerous"" book... ...or had a friend who was ""different""... ...or never joined an organization that advocated ""change""... ...we'd all be the kindof people Joe McCarthy wants. We're gonna go with the story, because the terror is in this room. John! Jesse! Go through the HUAC hearings. Eddie! Palmer! Look at who did the interviews and any speeches. Okay, fellas, here we go. His own words, that's what we need. ...said that he wouldn't remove a General from the Army... ...who supported a Communist Major. I said, ""Then, General..."" ""...you should be removed from any command."" ""Any man who says, ""I will protect and honor a General'..."" ""...'who protects Communists', is not fit to wear that uniform, General."" Ethically, we're fine. But legally, if we air this, are we leaking closed hearing testimony? - But he chose to read it. - We're not misquoting him. - There are other reporters. - If it's a legal issue, it's his. I'll check with Campbell in Legal. And wait till you hear the bleeding hearts... ...scream and cry about our methods... ...of trying to drag the truth... ...from those who know or should know... ...who covered up a Fifth Amendment Communist Major. But they say, ""Oh..."" ""...it's all right to uncover them, but don't get rough doing it, McCarthy."" Did a Civil Liberties Union provide you with an attorney at that time? I had many offers of attorneys... ...and from the American Civil Liberties Union, too. - The question is: ...did the Civil Liberties Union supply you with an attorney? - They did supply an attorney. - The answer is yes? The answer is yes. You know the Civil Liberties Union has been listed... ...as a front for and doing the work of the Communist Party? Mr. Chairman, this was 1932! I know this was in 1932. Do you know that they since have been listed... ...as a front for and doing the work of the Communist Party? I do not know that they have been listedso, sir. - You don't know? - I have heard that mentioned... All right, Leo. Turn it off. - I need those three cans of Stevens! - Has anybody read this book yet? It would be nice if this guy isn't a Commie. - Did Millie give it to you? - I wanna read the book. - Nobody else, Joe. - I hear you, boss. I'll put it on a kinescope, push through the end. Palmer, cut it at 2:30. I prefer it one on each end, let it run through. It'd be more powerful. Cut Kennedy? Joe, file it for me. I'll see the Mundt piece later. Are we gonna make it, Fred? We lost the telecine, but we'll make it. Did you finish your closing piece? It's Shakespeare. Write your closing. My argument was if you just show the images of McCarthy... ...it doesn't make any difference. If you agree with him, you're gonna hate the piece. If you don't, you'll love it. Maybe they should wait till they get more footage. I don't think wec an take that chance. We've got to hit McCarthy before he comes after Ed. The blue one. They haven't gone after the AIsops or Herb Block. Honey, the AIsops and Herb Block... ...didn't work for the Institute of International Education in 1934. Then I guess it's time. You worried? I didn't think I was. I don't know why. I was in the office on Friday. And I answered the phone, it was Howard calling from London. And he asked what was going on with McCarthy. And before I answered him, I turned and looked over my shoulder... ...tosee who was listening. - And who was listening? Chairman Mao... I'll see you at the office. - Hey, your ring! - Uh! Name me another wife... ...who reminds her husband to take off his wedding ring... ...before he goes to the office. - Ava Gardner. Excuse me, Mr. Friendly. Mr. Murrow, Mr. Paley's on the line for you. - Maybe he wants to reimburse us for those ads. - You'd like that! - I would like that! - This is Ed. There's a Knickerbocker game tonight. I've got front row seats. Are you interested? I'm busy bringing down the network tonight, Bill. Is that tonight? We're covered, Bill. All right. - I'm with you today, Ed, and I'm with you tomorrow. - Thanks, Bill. Do you know the timing on the first piece? Can we hold all the calls, please? Hold the calls till after the show. Thank you. - You fellas, awake down there? - Okay. - Just... what are we? 20? - seconds, Ed. seconds. 5, 4,3, 2. And pan, camera one. Because a report on Senator McCarthy is by definition controversial... ...we want to say exactly what we mean to say... ...and request your permission to read from a script... ...what ever remarks Murrow and Friendly may make. If the Senator feels that we have done violence to his words or pictures... ...and desires to answer himself... ...an opportunity will be afforded him on this program. Our working thesis tonight is this quotation: ...""If this fight against Communism..."" ""...has made a fight between America's two great political parties..."" ""...the American people know that one of these parties will be destroyed..."" ""...and the Republic cannot endure very long as a one-party system."" We applaud that statement... ...and we think Senator McCarthy ought to. He said it months ago in Milwaukee. The American people realize that this cannot be made a fight... ...between America's two great political parties. If this fight against Communism... ...is made a fight against America's two great political parties... ...the American people know that one of those parties will be destroyed... ...and the Republic can't endure very long as a one-party system. On one thing the Senator has been consistent. Often operating as a one-man committee, he has traveled far... ...interviewed many, terrorized some... ...accused civilian and military leaders... ...of the past administration of a great conspiracy... ...to turn over the country to Communism. I was extremely shocked when I heard that Secretary Stevens... ...told Army officers that they had to take part in the cover up... ...of those who promoted and coddled Communists. As I read his statement, I... ...thought of that quotation, ""On what meat..."" ""...does this our Caesar feed?"". The questions is: ...did the Civil Liberties Union supply you with an attorney? - They did supply an attorney. - The answer is yes? The answer is yes. Do you think this book did considerable harm? Its publication... ...by an expression of the views contained in it? The sale of that book was so abysmally small... ...it was so unsuccessful, that the question of its influence... You can go back to the publisher... ...you'll see it was one of the most unsuccessful books he ever put out. He's still sorry about it, just as I am. Well, I think that's a compliment to American intelligence. I'll say that. The Reed Harris hearing demonstrates one of the Senator's techniques. Twice he said... ...'The American Civil Liberties Union was listed as a subversive front."" The Attorney General's list does not and never has listed... ...the ACLU as subversive, nor does the FBI... ...or any other federal government agency. And the American Civil Liberties Union holds in its files... ...letters of commendation from President Truman... ...President Eisenhower, and General MacArthur. Earlier, the Senator asked, ""Upon what meat does this our Caesar feed?"". Had he looked three lines earlier in Shakespeare's ""Caesar""... ...he would have found this line, which is not altogether inappropriate. ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves."" No one familiar with the history of this country... ...can deny that Congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating... ...but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one... ...and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof... ...and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason... ...if we dig deep in our history and doctrine... ...and remember that we are not descended from fearful men... ...not from men who feared to write, to associate, to speak... ...and to defend the causes that were for the moment unpopular. This is no time for men who oppose Senator McCarthy's methods... ...to keep silent, or for those who approve. Wec an deny our heritage and our history... ...but we cannot escape responsibility for the results. We proclaim ourselves, indeed as we are... ...the defenders of freedom wherever it continues to exist in the world... ...but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home. The actions of the junior Senator from Wisconsin... ...have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad... ...and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn't create this situation of fear... ...he merely exploited it, and rather successfully. Cassius was right. ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves."" Good night, and good luck. And we're out. Nothing? Maybe nobody watched. - We got nothing. - I don't know. - Nothing. Should I turn the phones back on, Mr. Williams? Yes. Now would be a good time for that. Turn the phones on! Turn the pho... Mr. Friendly wants the phones on. It's the Junior Senator calling collect. Don't kid yourself. It's Reed Harris thanking us for mentioning him. I don't know whether all of you have seen what I just saw... ...but I want to associate myself and this program... ...with what Ed Murrow has just said... ...and say I have never been prouder of CBS. Senator McCarthy said today that he would demand equal free television... Stevenson had charged that the Senator made demagoguery and deceit... ...the national policy... - Is that Hollenbeck? - Congratulations! Great show! Feel like a Scotch? I think everybody could use a Scotch. - It's 3:30, early editions are out. - I'm not worried about that. Of course not. Shirley, honey... ...would you go across the street and get the early editions? - All of them? - Just get O'Brian! - Hey, watch my drink! - Yeah. Okay. Here we go. - At last! - The Times. - The Times... - First? - Good. - Who wrote it? - Jack Gould. Gould... Edward R. Murrows television program on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy... ...was an exciting and provocative examination of the man and his methods. It was crusading journalism of high responsibility and courage. For TV so often plagued by timidity and hesitation... ...the program was a milestone that reflected enlightened citizenship. The program... Hold on! The program was no less an indictment of those who wish... ...the problems posed by the Senator's tactics and theatrics... ...would just go away and leave them alone. That was Mr. Murrows and television's triumph... ...and a very great one. Here! Here! - He hated it. - Yeah. What's his beef? Send the New YorkTimes abottle of Scotch. I already did. How do you think we got that review? - How's the Post? - Pretty good! - What about O'Brian? - Uh, the same. - Goon, read O'Brian! - I don't have it. - Got it. - Oh. Here. - There we go. - Shirley, that... We can't say we were surprised at Murrows ""Hate McCarthy"" telecast... ...last evening, when his explosively one-sided propaganda... ...edited with deviously clever selectivity from McCarthy's march... ...against Communism, was finished last evening... ...by equally Machiavellian coincidence the following telecast... ...featured Murrow's PM protege, Hollenbeck. In an obviously gloating mood, Hollenbeck... ...hoped viewers had witnessed his patron's triumph... ...from and for the Left. Soon. Soon... Shirley, it's okay. Go ahead, finish it. - No, that's it. That's it. - Shirley, please, finish it. The CBS has been in a lengthy ""clean house of Lefties"" mood. The worst offenders on lesser levels... ...have been quietly pushed out of the company. Don Hollenbeck, a graduate of the demised pinko publication PM... ...attacked conservative papers with sly and slanted propaganda. He then proceeded through an equally... ...tilted review of the day's events... ...with McCarthy dominating his words, actions, attitudes. Soon. - It's O'Brian. - He didn't get the Scotch, that's all. - Is it grammatically correct? - I'll have that cigarette, Ed. - Thanks, Shirley. - Oh. - Mmh. - Thank you. Joe... Shirley... It doesn't matter. To Jack Gould! - To Jack! To Jack! To Jack Gould! - To Jack Gould! I love Jack Gould! May he rest in peace. - Hello, Jimmy. - Fred, congratulations! - Thank you. I got such a hangover to go along with the ulcer. All the adguys on the 3rd floor watched the show. Got a good review in the New York Times. Jack Gould. We're putting out a press release... ...saying that calls came in to in favor of the show. - Really? - Yeah. - to 1? - We got calls from everywhere. - East Coast or West Coast? - Yeah. Kansas City, Cincinnati... Mr. Paley... - Morning, Fred. - Morning, Mr. Paley. How's your wife? She's fine. We're getting ready to move. - Really? Where to? - Riverdale. We found a nice house there. It's nice there. Yes, sir. Excuse me. Fred! McCarthy wants William Buckey to do his rebuttal. I said no. Yes, sir. Hey, Johnny! - Radulovich has been reinstated. - What?! Radulovich... Guys! Radulovich has been reinstated. - Jesse! Jesse! - Where is Ed? - He's in the bullpen. Why? What's going on? - Jess! Got some very good news. Special announcement from the Secretary of the Air Force! Fellas! Listen up! Everyone! I have decided that it is consistent... ...with the interests of the National Security to retain... ...Lieutenant Radulovich in the United States Air Force. Stop. He is not, in my opinion, a security risk. Fullstop. There you go. Harold E. Talbott, Secretary from the Air Force. Great job! - Make a copy of that for me! - I will do, Fred! Back to work, guys! We got a lot of work to do. This means something. - Good news, huh? - Congratulations! - This absolutely means something. - Absolutely. This is the start of... Palmer! The CBS lawyers wanna talk to you. When? Tomorrow. I don't want you to get paranoid, they're talking to everybody. Any ideas? Just tell them what you know. - Now is that testimony true? - No, sir, it is not. Not at any time have I been a member of the Communist Party... ...and I have never seen a Communist card. - You've never seen a Communist card? - That's right. Have you ever attended any Communist meetings? No, sir, never. Have you ever subscribed to The Daily Worker? No, sir. I didn't subscribe to it and I wouldn't pay for it. Uh... Now, Mrs. Markward, who was working for the FBI... ...who joined the Communist Party under orders from the FBI... ...has testified that while she never met you personally... ...at a Communist meeting that your name was on the list... ...of Communists who were paying dues. Uh... Can you shed any light upon that? No, sir. I don't even know what the dues are... ...or where they were paid. - So you have never paid any money... ...to the Communist Party. - Is that correct? - That's right. You've never paid any dues, payment... Thank you very much, Leo! Good work, Joe, Charlie. Now what is the show? Is it defending Annie Lee Moss as not being a Communist? - Or is ither Constitutional rights? - Both. - The latter. We're much better sticking out the Constitutional issues. - Agreed? - The woman is not a Communist spy. Joe McCarthy said that they have a spy in the Pentagon... ...that spy has gotten into the code room... ...and that that spy is Annie Lee Moss. I've got New York Times reports. McCarthy asserts he has... ...a new red link to Army. Quote, ""Senator McCarthy charged today..."" ""...that the Army now employs a woman in its code room..."" ""...who was, and still may be, an active Communist."" It's the front page of the New York Times. No sooner is he done chastising the other committee members for wanting... ...to push into the afternoon, than what? Seven questions in... ...he ducks out, leaves... - Right. - Heleaves. - It's all over the headlines, all over the country. Get me copies from any newspaper... ...that printed anything about that assertion. That's a good idea. You should get the Cincinnati Inquirer. - Chicago. - Couple other pieces I think we should include. The fact that there's Annie Lee Moss's in the phone book. There are Robert Halls, one's colored, one's white. We have some footage of the empty chair. I think that says it all. Just that picture of McCarthy not... McCarthy leaving the hearing after questions... ...and then we'll cut to the shot of thechair. - We gotta do something about it. - All right, so... Excuse me. Mr. Murrow! McCarthy wants April 6th. Thank you, Natalie. Fine. If Charlie shoots it, we get to see it first. We should offer. - It's a long shot. - What the hell could McCarthy do? Is he gonna debate himself? We just used his words! Johnny! Johnny! We know what it's going to be. He's going to come after me. There's nothing more he can do. He's gonna bet that a Senator trumps a newsman. He'll lose. Not if we're playing bridge. - I'm sorry, guys. I didn't mean to interrupt. - Hey, Don. - It's getting fun now! - Ed, you have aminute? - Yes, I'll be right there. - All right, boys. Playtime's over. We have days... ...to do a minute show. - Yeah. - All right. All right, go ahead. Hi, Mary. Hello, Mr. Hollenbeck. Mr. Murrow... - Could you give us a moment? - Sure. Thank you, dear. I have to ask you something, Ed. It's about O'Brian. - O'Brian doesn'tmatter. - He's killing me, Ed. He doesn't amount to that much in the newsroom. We've got to let that guy have it. We're not going after O'Brian. I will not take on McCarthy and Hearst. I can't defeat them both. Just don't read the papers. Or don't read O'Brian, anyway. Okay. I guess not. Sorry, Don. Although Mrs. Moss offered to testify... ...Senator McCarthy suggested that she was too sick. - She agreed... - Mr. Cohn wanted to know about Mrs. Moss's connection... ...to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth... ...so help you God? May we get your full name for the record, please? Annie Lee Moss. - M-O-S-S? - That's right. Mrs. Moss, let me say for the record, for your information... ...for the information of your counsel... ...that you are not here because... ...you are considered important in the Communist apparatus. We have the testimony that you are, and have been, a Communist. We are rather curious, however, to kno whow you suddenly... ...were shifted from... ...a worker in a cafeteria to the code room. I am today much more interested... ...in the handling of your case... ...by your superiors than in your own personal activities. However, counsel will question you about your own activities also. - Mr. Chairman! - We will not hear from counsel. You have been told what the rule is. If you have anything to say, say it through your client. Chairman. Did you begin work at the General Accounting Office in... ...1945? - Yes, sir. And, prior to that time, had you been a cafeteria worker? Yes, I had. I see. While in the Pentagon, since 1950... ...have you had any connections with coded messages? Have you ever handled coded messages? - No more than to transmit 'em. - Pardon me? No more than to transmit the message. Than to transmit them? Did you transmit codes? To receive or transmit messages was all I had to do. And I've never been into a courtroom in my life. Do you know the... ...type of classification... - Do you know if they were secret, top secret, confidential? - No, sir. - You wouldn't know the degree of classification? - No, sir. I see. I'm afraid I'm going to have to excuse myself, I've got... ...a rather important appointment to work on right now... ...and I wonder if, Senator Mundt, you would takeover as Chairman? - Chairman. Uh... - Cohn. I have no further questions of this witness at this time. We have the testimony of Mrs. Markward, the undercover agent for the FBI... ...stating that Annie Lee Moss was a member, a dues-paying member... ...of the Communist Party... ...the Northeast Club of the Communist Party. We have corroboration of that testimony by another... ...witness who was called before the Committee... ...and gave a sworn statement to the effect... ...that she also knew Mrs. Moss as a member... ...of the Northeast Club of the Communist Party. She's already lost her job. She's been suspended because of this action. I'm not defending her. If she's a Communist, I want her exposed. But to make these statements as we've got corroborating evidence... ...that she is a Communist, under these circumstances... ...I think she's entitled to have it produced here in her presence... ...and let the public know about it and let her know about it. I don't like to try people by hearsay evidence. I'd like to get the witnesses here and try them... ...by testimony, under oath. The Chair will rule that the comment of Mr. Cohn... ...be stricken from the record. I didnt ask that, Mr. Chairman! ...whether we should try to produce a witness in public... ...because the FBI may have her undercover and we don't want to... You can't strike these statements made by counsel here as to evidence... ...that we're having and withholding. You cannot strike that from the press... ...nor from the public mind once it's planted there. That's the... ...evil of it! - Well, I'd look at it... - I don't think it's fair to a witness... ...to a citizen of this country... ...to bring them up here and cross-examine them... ...then when they get through, say... ...""The FBI has got something on you that condemns you."" - The Chair agrees... - It is not sworn testimony... ...it's convicting people by rumor and hearsay and innuendo. You will notice that neither Senator McClellan or Senator Symington... ...nor this reporter know or claim that Mrs. Moss was or is a Communist. They simply claimed that she had the right to meet her accusers face to face. One month ago tonight we presented a report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. We labeled it as controversial. Most of that report consisted of words and pictures of the Senator. At that time, we said... ...""If theSenator believes we havedone violence to his words or pictures..."" ""...if he desires to speak, to answer himself..."" ""...an opportunity would be afforded him on this program."" The Senator sought the opportunity after weeks... ...because he was very busy and wished adequate time to prepare his reply. We agreed. We placed no restrictions on the manner of the presentation of his reply... ...and we suggested that we would not take time to comment... ...on this particular program. Here now is Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, junior Senator from Wisconsin. Good evening. Mr. Edward R. Murrow, Educational Director of the CBS... ...devoted his program to an attack... ...on the work ofthe US Senate Investigating Committee... ...and on me personally as its Chairman. Now, over the past years, he has made repeated attacks upon me... ...and those fighting Communists. Of course, neither Joe McCarthy nor Edward R. Murrow... ...is of any great importance as individuals. We are only important... ...in our relation to the great struggle to preserve our American liberties. Now ordinarily, I wouldnt take time out from the important work at hand... ...to answer Murrow. However, in this case... ...I feel justified in doing so because Murrow is the symbol... ...the leader... ...and the cleverest of the jackal pack which is always found at the throat... ...of anyone who dares to expose individual Communists and traitors. And I am compelled by the fact... ...to say to you that Mr. Edward R. Murrow... ...as far back as years ago... ...was engaged in propaganda for Communist causes. For example, the Institute of International Education... ...of which he was the Acting Director... ...was chosen to act as a representative... ...by a Soviet agency... ...to do a job which would normally be done by the Russian secret police. Mr. Murrow, by his own admission, was a member of the IWW... ...that's the Industrial Workers of the World... ...a terrorist organization cited as subversive... ...by an Attorney General of the United States. Mr. Murrow said on this program and I quote... ...""The actions of the junior Senator from Wisconsin..."" ""...have given considerable comfort to the enemy."" That is the language of our statute of treason, rather strong language. If I am giving comfort to our enemies, I ought not to be in the Senate. If, on the other hand, Mr. Murrow... ...is giving comfort to our enemies... ...he ought not to be brought into the homes... ...of millions of Americans by the CBS. And I want to assure you... ...that I will not be deterred... ...by the attacks of the Murrows, the Lattimores, the Fosters... ...The Daily Worker or the Communist Party itself. And I make no claim to leadership. Incomplete humility... ...I do ask you and every American who loves this country... ...to join with me. Everyone talks about the weather. Wherever you look on America's modern farms... ... aluminum is on the job, helping the farmer do something about the weather. Aluminum for the farm is one more example of how Alcoa... ... since 1999... ... has continued to pioneer new uses for this vital metal. New uses of aluminum that mean better farms and better farming. The aluminum from the nation's first and leading producer... ... Alcoa, Aluminum Company of America. Last week, Senator McCarthy appeared on this program... ...to correct any errors he might have thought we made... ...in our report of March 9th. Since he made no reference to any statements of fact that we made... ...we must conclude that he found no errors of fact. He proved again that anyone who exposes him... ...anyone who doesn't share his disregard for decency and human dignity... ...and the rights guaranteed by the Constitution... ...must be either a Communist or a fellow traveler. I fully expected this treatment. The Senator added this reporter's name to a long list of individuals... ...and institutions he has accused of serving the Communist cause. His proposition is very simple: ...anyone who criticizes or opposes Senator McCarthy's methods... ...must be a Communist. And if that be true, there are an awful lot of Communists in the USA. For the record, let's consider briefly some of the Senator's charges. He claimed, but offered no proof... ...that I had been a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. That is false. I was never a member ofthe IWW, never applied for membership. The Senator charged that Professor Harold Laski... ...a British scholar and politician, dedicated a book to me. That's true. He is dead. He was a socialist, I am not. He was a civilized individual... ...who did not insist upon agreement with his political principles... ...as a pre-condition for conversation or friendship. I do not agree with his political ideas. I ask, as he makes clear in the introduction... ...dedicated the book to me, not because of political agreement... ...but because he held my wartime broadcast from London in high regard. And the dedication so reads. I believed years ago and I believe today... ...that mature Americans can engage in conversation and controversy... ...the clash of ideas, with Communists anywhere in the world... ...without becoming contaminated or converted. I believe that our faith, our conviction... ...our determination are stronger than theirs... ...and that we can successfully compete, not only in the area of bombs... ...but in the area of ideas. I have worked with CBS for more than years. The company has subscribed fully to my integrity and responsibility... ...as a broadcaster and as a loyal American. I require no lectures from the junior Senator from Wisconsin... ...as to the dangers or terrors of Communism. Having searched my conscience and my files... ...I cannot contend that I have always been right or wise... ...but I have attempted to pursue thet ruth with diligence... ...and to report it... ...even though, as in this case, I had been warned in advance... ...that I would be subjected to the attentions of Senator McCarthy. We shall hope to deal with matters of more vital interest next week. Good night, and good luck. In the last analysis, the Senator was perched on the television high dive... ...and all prepared to make a resounding splash. He jumped beautifully, but he neglected to check first... ...where he was going to land. It must have been a shock... ...to discover that Mr. Murrow had drained the water out of the pool. - Is that the Times? Gould? - Yeah, it's Jack Gould. - He's a hell of a writer. - Yes, he is. - If we can afford him! - Stanton's got a public opinion... Senate's investigating McCarthy. What? The Army's charging that McCarthy and Cohn exercised undue pressure... ...to get preferential treatment for Schine. - Who's the source? - Got a second source? - There isn't, but this is coming out in hours. - Who's heading up the investigation? - It's not gonna be McCarthy! - Really? - What happened? - Also get me the Washington Post! - What's going on? It's Williams for Jack Thompson. The Senate's investigating McCarthy. There is an added bit of comedy to this whole story. The Committee cannot convene for several days... ...because Senator McCarthy has a slight case of laryngitis. And he must recover over the desert air of Arizona. - But Stevens is going after him and it looks like Joe Welch. - Yeah. They're gonna allow each side to call witnesses... ...and be privy to other testimony. - Fred, we still have a meeting! - We're gonna go to talk toThompson. No, thanks, Jack. Bye. Freddy, we're a hit. Right up there with ""Howdy Dowdy""! Can I have an outlet satellite, please? - 74, 76,47. Thank you. - Murrayville3, 1-2-7-6. The fact of newscaster Don Hollenbeck's suicide yesterday... ...does not remove from the record that peculiar history... ...of the leftist slanting of news indulged consistently by the CBS. Hollenbeck was what most astute students of CBS's strange... ...and questionable new methods considered... ...""typical of its newscasters"". By Jack O'Brian. Oh, yeah. I like it like that. One of the best programs I ever heard was called ""CBS Views The Press"". A great many people liked it, some didn't... ...but noone ever called it anything but honest. It was the work of an honest reporter. Don Hollenbeck. He also worked occasionally on ""See It Now'. He did the p.m. News over some of these stations. He had been sick lately and he died this morning. The police said it was suicide... gas. Not much of an obit. But, at least we got our facts straight, and it was brief. And that's all Don Hollenbeck would have asked. Good night, and good luck. Got to be in Philadelphia this morning. What time is your train? 9:00. - Charlie going with you? - Uh-huh. Here's a thought. What if we're wrong? We're not wrong. We're not going to look back... ...and say we protected the wrong side? Protected them from what? In the name of what? What would we be preserving? Argument could bemade, 'for the greater good"". Not once you give it all away. It's no good then. It's just a thought. Senator, may we not drop this? We know he belonged to the Lawyer's Guild. And Mr. Cohn nods his head at me. - I did you, I think, no personal injury, Mr. Cohn. - No, sir. - I meant to do you no personal injury. - No. And if I did, I beg your pardon. Let us not assassinate this lad further, Senator. You've done enough. - Let's... let's... - Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency? - I know this hurts you, Mr. Welch. - Senator, I think it hurts you, too. - I'd like to finish this. - Have you some private reservation... ...when you take the oath that you will tell the whole truth... ...that lets you be the judge of what you will testify to? The answer is there's no reservation about telling the whole truth. Thank you, sir. Then tell us who delivered the documents to you! I don't want to mean that this new fashion is not chic. - I think it's just no good for me. - Uh, not for you. Milko, anything you care to say on that subject? I think no comment. It's got to be there. If you can't find it, I cant write about it. - Check again. - Charlie said he dropped it off. - Charlie said he dropped... - Shirley, can I see you a minute? - I got to call you back. - Joe! You, too. Close the door. Have a seat. - How are you? - Fine, thank you. - Swell. Yeah. Uh, you both are aware that there's a policy at CBS... ...that no two employees can be married. I want to ask you a question, but I don't want you to answer it. I want you to consider it. I know you two are married. Everyone knows. That's not my question. In the next few weeks I have to lay off a couple of people. We're making some significant cuts across the board. I wanted you to know that... ...because you could save someone else being fired. I'm asking you to consider makng this decision a little easier. I don't need an answer now. Just think about it. Good. - Well, Joe... - Well? - Sure we'regonna miss you around here. - I'll pack my things. - I think it's for the best. - We'll find out! Mrs. Wershba... Everybody knew. Natalie, did he say what it was about? No. Just that he wanted to talk to you in his office. Uh-oh! The problem isn't simply that you've lost your sponsor. With Alcoa, ""See It Now"" still loses money. The fee is 50,000 dollars. Last week's episode we did for less than 50,000 dollars. Fred, you're speakng beyond your competence. We'll certainly find another sponsor. ""64,000 Dollar Question"" brings in over 90,000 in sponsors... ...and it costs one-third of what youdo. Ed, I've got Tuesday night programming that's number one. People want to enjoy themselves. They don't want a civics lesson. - What do you want, Bill? - I don't want to get a stomachache... ...every time you take on a controversial subject. I'm afraid that's the price you have to be willing to pay. Let's walk very carefully through these next few moments. The content of what we're doing is more important... ...than what some guy in Cincinnati... - It's what you'redoing, Ed. Not me. Not Frank Stanton. You. ""CBS News"", ""See It Now"" all belong to you, Bill. You wouldn't know it. - What is it you want? Credit? - I never censored a single program. I hold on to affiliates who wanted entertainment from us. I fight to keep the license... ...with the very same politicians that you are bringing down... ...and I never, never said no to you. Never. I would argue that we have done very well by one another. I would argue that this network... ...is defined by what the news department has accomplished. And I would also argue that never saying no is not the same as not censoring. Really? You should teach journalism. You and Mr. Friendly. Let me ask you this: ...why didn't you correct McCarthy... ...when he said that Alger Hiss was convicted of treason? He was only convicted of perjury. You corrected everything else. Did you not want the appearance of defending a known Communist? I would argue that everyone censors, including you. What do you want to do, Bill? I'm takng your program from a half an hour to an hour. And it wont be a weekly program and it won't be Tuesday nights. - When would it be? - Sunday afternoons. - How many episodes? - 5. Why don't you just fire me, Bill? I don't think it's what either of us wants. You owe me shows. - You won't like the subject matter. - Probably not. Fred, I'll need you for a moment. - Thank you, Mary. - Goodbye, Mr. Friendly. - He wants me to lay a few people off. - I'm sure he does. Let's do our first show about the downfall of television. - Senate's gonna vote to censure McCarthy tomorrow. - Probably. - And then what happens? - He sits in the back row. - Right. - They keep him in the Senate. They don't kick him out. - No, he stays. Well, we might as well go down swinging. Did you know the most trusted man in America is Milton Berle? See, you should have worn a dress! - Howd does a Scotch sound? - Scotch sounds good. - Did you know Joe and Shirley were married? - Sure. - Did everyone know? - Pretty much. We are proud because from the beginning of this nation... ...man can walk upright. No matter who he is or who she is. He can walk upright and meet his friend or his enemy. And he does not fear that because that enemy... ...may be in a position of great power... ...that he can be suddenly thrown in jail... ...to rott here without charges and with no recourse to justice. We have the Habeas Corpus Act and we respect it. I began by saying that our history will be what we makeit. If we go on as we are... ...then history will take its revenge, and retribution will not limp... ...in catching up with us. Just once in a while, let us exalt the importance of ideas and information. Let us dream to the extent of saying that on a given Sunday night... ...the time normally occupied by Ed Sullivan... ...is given over to a clinical survey on the state of American education. And a week or two later, the time normally used by Steve Allen... ...is devoted to a thorough-going study of American policy in the Middle East. Would the corporate image of their respective sponsors be damaged? Would the shareholders rise up in their wrath and complain? Would anything happen... ...other than a few million people would have received a little illumination... ...on subjects that may well determine the future of this country... ...and therefore the future of the corporations? To those who say, ""People wouldn't look, they wouldn't be interested..."" ""...they're tooc omplacent, indifferent and insulated""... ...I can only reply: There is, in one reporter's opinion... ...considerable evidence against that contention. But even if they are right, what have they got to lose? Because if they are right... ...and this instrument is good for nothing... ...but to entertain, amuse and insulate... ...then the tube is flickering now... ...and we will soon see that the whole struggle is lost. This instrument can teach. It can illuminate and it can even inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it... ...towards those ends. Otherwise, it is merely wiresand lights... ...in a box. Good night, and good luck."
32,2016,Race,American,"Jesse Owens, a promising black American runner, attends Ohio State University, despite facing racial discrimination and slurs from the white athletes. He attracts the attention of coach Larry Snyder, who believes Owens has enormous potential but needs work on his form and technique. When Snyder suggests he is good enough to compete at the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, Owens is interested, but hesitant because of racial propaganda in Nazi Germany. The U.S. Olympic Committee is already considering boycotting the Olympics over Germany's discriminatory policies, only agreeing to participate when Nazi official Joseph Goebbels gives personal assurances they will allow foreign athletes of any race to compete, as well as promising to rein in their propaganda.
As Owens struggles to support his girlfriend Ruth and young daughter, he takes a job at a service station, upsetting Snyder when his job conflicts with his commitment to train. When Snyder learns Owens has a family to support, he gets him a no-show job, allowing him to focus on running. Owens goes on to break several records, including some of Snyder's, and begins a relationship with a woman whose attentions he attracts with his newfound fame. When Ruth threatens him with a lawsuit, Owens becomes distracted and loses a race to runner Eulace Peacock. Owens decides to return to Ruth to reconcile, convincing her to marry him. As the Olympics draw closer, the NAACP asks him not to go to Berlin for political reasons. Owens is conflicted, but Peacock urges him to compete to defy Nazi racial ideology.
In Berlin, Owens wins his first gold medal in the 100 m dash, but when he is brought by International Olympic Committee member Avery Brundage to receive congratulations from Adolf Hitler, he is told the Chancellor has left the stadium early to avoid traffic. Brundage warns Goebbels that Hitler must congratulate all winners or no winners, with Goebbels replying Hitler will not appear with ""that"". Owens next qualifies for the broad jump after German rival Luz Long unexpectedly gives him tips on his technique. Owens wins another medal, and Luz publicly shakes his hand and joins him for a victory lap, privately expressing concern about national politics. Owens wins his fourth and final medal in the 4 x 100 m relay, filling in for two Jewish American athletes cut by Brundage, who is convinced by Goebbels to do so to avoid a scandal over a business arrangement Brundage entered with the Nazis before the games. Director Leni Riefenstahl films the event against Goebbels' orders, then asks Owens to repeat his medal-winning broad jump to get a few more shots for her next film, Olympia.",7.1,tt3499096,"Mornin'. Mmm. Mornin'. Anybody see my shirt? Mama, you seen my shirt? It's where you put it last. - Anyone? - No. I got your shirt right here. Hand it over. Here you go. Mmm. Cut it out, Quincy. It's my only shirt. Oh, come on now. What's the matter? You too fancy for us now, college boy? Uh, what's that supposed to mean? I've always paid my way. You know I send what I can. Bye, Mama. Mama, what are you doing? First boy of mine to go to college is gonna look respectable. You like it? Ma, we can't afford this. Try it on. Mama, it's Ohio State. It's not Sunday school. Shh! Thought I was gonna lose you at five years old. Now look at you. I knew when I cut that lump out of you, you were born for great things. Yeah. God spared you for a reason. There. You look handsome. A man has to present an image to the world. You remember that, James Cleveland Owens. Yes, Mama. Thank you. Thank you, Mama. Bye, Laverne. Is Dad coming downstairs today? I hope so. He knows you're leaving. So long, Pa. Things are gonna turn around, Pa. You'll see. That's Ohio State's Ken Seitz in the dust. It's Charlie Parsons and Foy Draper from the University of Southern California. And another poor showing for Ohio State. Good race. Hey, there's the coach. Hey. Larry. What's up, Dean? How many is that now? Asshole. Sorry, Coach. This time I really thought I had 'em beat. Yeah, well, that's probably why you didn't, then. That makes it three straight losses for Larry Snyder and Ohio State. After two years without a national win, you've gotta wonder if the Buckeyes made a mistake bringing Snyder back to coach at his old alma mater. He was a hell of an athlete in his time, but that doesn't make you a great coach. If I was Larry Snyder right now, I'd be worried about keeping my job. Here's a man who's no stranger to winning, USC coach, Dean Cromwell. With four Olympic gold medalists to his credit, it's no wonder they call him ""the maker of champions."" Thanks for making the time, Mr. Cromwell. It's a pleasure. Call me Dean... Oh, no. Please, switch it back on. Why? So we can watch you sit around all afternoon feeling sorry for yourself? How do you know what I have scheduled? Oh, I know the schedule. Fresh blood. Hi. How are y'all doing? I'm Dave. Mmm-hmm. Fine weather we're having, isn't it? Dave! Y'all so sophisticated. Dave, would you quit bothering every girl you see? I'm not bothering them none. They never met a college man before. They're impressed. Yeah, well, you ain't a college man yet. All right, so, come on. Let's go. All right, give me minutes. Take a cold shower or something. Can you grab that comb for me in the back? Gloria. Gloria. Come here, sweetie. Give me a moment. Come to Daddy. I'm working, Jesse. You can't come here when I'm working. You just try and keep me away. See, that's the kind of talk got us in trouble to begin with. Really? Get out of here, you big dope. Go on, get. Money's gonna be a little tight from now on. Till then, take this. I'll send more as soon as I find work. You should put some aside for the wedding. Are you finally gonna marry me, Jesse Owens? Gotta do it right. Hi. How you doing? See that, that way that colored pushed me? Hi. How you doing? Put a Negro in a suit... Hurry up, shorty! I wanna get there before we graduate. Whoo-hoo! Good games... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Now, where do you boys think you're going? Just using the showers. Not until we're through, you're not. You niggers can wait your turn. Yeah. Can you believe they let these jiggaboos share our locker room now? Let's get outta here. They won't ever play football. Dave. No, sir. OSU, what? OSU, what? Kick that cracker's ass is what I should do. Sounds like a great idea. Get us thrown outta here before our bags are unpacked. Dave, this is our shot. All right? Don't blow it. Hey, Owens. Coach wants to see you. Now. Let's go! Let's go! What am I supposed to do, kiss his ass after I wipe it for him? No, sir. Look, you just smile and play nice. Run every last one of these peckerwoods off their feet. Hey. Sorry. That's some outfit. What's this, a pickaninny parade? Slow down, boy! Well, look at this. Peggy, who do we have here? Coach Snyder, I'm Jesse Owens. Nice jacket. Think I had the same one back in Sunday school. Coming in, or what? Shut the door. Oh, you can sit down. Charlie Riley says you can run. Yes, sir. Well, says you're a natural, best he's ever seen. Well, I guess. Me personally, I don't trust naturals, 'cause they think they don't have to work. I will say, you can run. And, boy, oh, boy, you can jump. What I wanna know is, can you win? And what I mean by that is, can you work? You know, your mama might've taught you how to dress right, but she sure as hell didn't teach you anything about manners. You should look a man in the eye when he's speaking to you. Can you work? I was picking pounds of cotton a day at six years old. You ever pick cotton? The way it cuts you when you, when you get it off the boll? Yes, sir, I can work. Coach Riley's a smart man. But I was watching you out there today, I'll tell you this. Your start's no good, your rhythm's off and your posture's lousy. But we can fix all that. That's easy. But if you wanna win, it takes more than a pair of legs, all right? You win up here. And that's the part I don't know about you yet. I don't know if you got that. I ran yards last year in Chicago in 9.4. Mmm-hmm. I mean, it's the same as Wykoff. It's a world record. Records don't mean shit! You know what matters? Medals. Some kid come out of nowhere, snatch your record from you like that. But a gold medal? That's yours for life. Is that you? Mmm-hmm. It's the US Olympic team, Paris games, '24. Go ahead, take a look. That's me on the right, next to Charley Paddock. You, you went to Paris in '24 with Charley Paddock? No. Well, why not? You wanna win a gold medal? Well, sure. You wanna do it in Berlin? Well, I mean, unless you were planning on waiting. You know, I... I heard they don't care much for colored folk over there. Well, they don't care for 'em much here in Columbus either. Is that gonna be a problem? No, sir. I just came here to run. Well, then, for the next months, you're either in a classroom or you're on that track, every hour, every day. And I don't care about your grades. I really don't. And I don't care if your buddies have a keg they need help with. And I certainly don't care if you got a girl at home rolling down her silk stockings with that look in her eye. You belong to me. Do we have an understanding? Yes, sir. Good. All right, well, go home and get some rest. 9:00 a.m. tomorrow, we'll see how good you really are. Jesse. Why'd you come here? I mean, after the noise you made in Chicago, hell, you could've gone anywhere you wanted. You know, maybe someplace a little more progressive. Yeah, well... Mr. Riley said you were the best. Mmm. Another one? Uh-huh. Well, the joke on the board is, they're thinking of renaming us the ""Model T State."" Mmm. Any color you want, so long as it's black. Yeah, well, maybe if you and Coach Schmidt let 'em play football, they wouldn't all choose track and field, huh? Jesse! Ready when you are. Okay, Coach. Let's see what we got here. Ready, go! Whoo! Well, I don't know why you look so impressed. This was a second slower than Wykoff's record. Frank Wykoff runs yards in 9.4. Kid just ran meters. Well, Lynn, you know that meters are longer than yards, yeah? No. There a problem, Coach? Uh, no. No, Jesse. No problem at all. Uh-uh. You want me to do it again? Yeah. That'd be great. Watch your start. He works on his start, you're looking at a gold medalist right there. That is, if they have a '36 Olympics. We won't go to Berlin, Brundage! Nazi-lover! Get your hands off me! Americans can't take part in these games! Okay, we're here. Take a seat, Avery. What's this I'm hearing about a boycott? Hmm? Nothing's been decided yet, but we're hearing some pretty ugly reports out of Germany. Apparently, they're rounding up Romany Gypsies... Gypsies! ...vandalizing Jewish property. They're using the sports clubs to exclude Jewish athletes from trials. They're putting up two women, Mayer and Bergmann, both Jewish. Oh, two! As a token gesture. Well, maybe the rest weren't good enough. Excuse me? Is this really the point here? It is not the purpose of the Amateur Athletics Union or the American Olympic Committee or the International Olympic Committee to tell Germans how to govern their affairs. So you think we should just sit back and take their word that they're going to play fair? I'm saying politics has no place in sport. The AAU already accepted the invitation to compete. You wanna go back on your word? If they go back on theirs. There's a lot of hateful literature coming out of there, and it is not only against the Jews. Now they're saying they don't want Negroes to compete. Krauts got kicked in the balls years ago, and they're still catching their breath. They need these games. Show they're back on their feet. Why would they risk us pulling out? Maybe they don't think we have the nerve. We have had every assurance they will not discriminate. And you trust the word of a Nazi? I've never met a Nazi. Have you? Come to think of it, when was the last time you played holes with a Jew or a Negro? Come on. The situation here is hardly comparable. It's not? You want to pull out of the greatest sporting event in the world because of a few rumors. It's been a tough few years here, too. The American people need champions to remind them what they're capable of. I'm surprised you can still see the American people from all the way up there in your skyscraper. Screw you, Mahoney. These games have to be inclusive. If I'm not satisfied that the Nazis are going to make good on their promises, I have no alternative but to recommend a vote to boycott. You can't do that. You can't do that. You can't do that. No, but I can urge each athlete to search their conscience, and I know a lot of people on the American and the International Committees who feel the way I do. But that's politics, that's not sport. Okay. We'll send someone over there to find out. Keep them in line. Uh, who do you have in mind? I propose Avery. I'm a builder. Don't you have some tame diplomat for that? I think you're just the diplomat we need. Gather around. Okay, we got some new exercises. You're gonna think I'm nuts, but we're gonna do 'em anyway. First, we're gonna start off with high knees, like that. You got to lift those legs. And we're gonna work on your syncopation. A lot people think a shorter stride makes you slower. Well, a lot of people are wrong. A shorter stride means more strides and a faster time. When your feet are in the air, you're not moving forward. So let's get those legs working double-time. Let's go! Move it, move it, move it! Dear Ruth, this is all I can send you this month. Our books cost much more than you'd think. But I got a job at a service station that's good for a few bucks a week. Our coach has his own ideas about how to get things done. He's working us pretty hard. Now, you probably won't believe this, but guess what I did today? I applied for a marriage license. I'm coming back for you in style, Minnie Ruth. Kiss Gloria for me. I miss you both so much. Jesse. Come on. Let's go. I'm coming. Missed you at practice this morning. Yeah. I, I had to cut up a frog for lab class. Okay. What about this afternoon? I was at the service station. What, were you pumping gas? Look, Coach, I need this job. I got a lot of people counting on me, all right? Well, I guess I misunderstood. 'Cause I was under the impression when you stood in my office and you looked me in the eye, that you made me a goddamn commitment! You think you know everything? Got nothing left to learn, is that it? Huh? No, sir! Look, I know I ain't as fast as I want to be, but you need to figure out a way to feed and put clothes on my baby girl. Or else, fit your practices in around me, 'cause I'm all out of options. Hey! Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter? You never asked. Welcome to Germany, Herr Brundage! Thank you. I trust you had a pleasant flight? Yeah. Very impressive. This will be the largest and most technically advanced stadium in Olympic history. acres, with a capacity of 110, 000. A little more, I think, than your Los Angeles Coliseum. Every moment is being recorded by Miss Leni Riefenstahl, one of our most talented young filmmakers, handpicked by the Fuhrer himself. This is history, Herr Brundage. For the first time, an audience of millions will experience the Olympics as if they were there themselves. I've never had much time for the pictures. Herr Brundage... Let's allow Miss Riefenstahl to explain. Sorry, I'm late. May I present Dr. Joseph Goebbels? How do you do? His ministry is financing my little film. Well, I've been hearing all about it. It's my hope that Olympia will stand as the greatest advertisement for the Olympic ideals the world has ever seen. At last, we will be able to honor the full glory of the games. And I thought this was all about the glory of the Nazis. We hope to present a favorable image of ourselves, that's all. Well, then, let me ask you something. Do you want to be remembered as the guys who held the Olympics without America? The minister hopes you are impressed by the facilities here at our sports club. Yeah, the facilities are great. No problem with the facilities. But the one thing that puzzles me is you don't allow Jews to be members, and that's the only way they can qualify for the games. We have several, very promising Jewish athletes we expect to compete. Look, I'm not here to tell you how to run your country. I walk in a man's house, I'm not gonna piss on his rug. But I don't expect him to feed me manure and call it foie gras. You wanna use these games to sell your nasty little ideas to the world, and I'm here to tell you no one is gonna stand for it. You gotta clean up your act. Would you like me to translate or interpret? Avery, what did you have in mind? Gotta take down those posters. Put a leash on your press. I don't wanna hear about anymore rounding up of undesirables. And I want your word, here, today, that you will not exclude Jews and Negroes from the games. So long as they're American citizens, we'll bring Martians if we want to. If the minister agrees, he can count on your support? Sure. Coach? There you go. What, what's this? An identity and registration card for the Ohio state legislature. All the pages there gotta have them. What's a page do? Takes home bucks a month, plus expenses. All right. But what does he gotta do? Nothing. He's got the Big Ten Championships coming up. He trains. Thanks, Coach. See you at 9:00 a.m. sharp. Ten seconds. Okay? I want you to count that to yourself. Ten seconds, fellas. That's all you get to run the 100. Sixty strides, and every single one of them counts. There's no margin for error, all right? You could fall down in the 400, pick yourself up and still place. Not here. Now, if you're over-striding, if your cadence is too slow, it can cost you a quarter of a second the whole race. Every fraction of every second counts, but it's your start that counts the most of all. Go. I'm looking at you, Jesse. You come off the gun like you're slamming into a brick wall, and it pains me to watch it, okay? You gotta start low. You gotta glide into it like an airplane. Any of you fellows ever seen an airplane take off? The lower you are, the longer you stay there, the less resistance you get, the faster you are. It's that simple. Ready? And we're gonna keep working on that over and over, okay? You gotta stay low all the way through the hurdle, okay? Wow. The great Jesse Owens. Jesse, let's get back to basics. Why don't you swing from those bamboo poles over there, boy? That's right, jiggaboos! Let's see you hang off those bars! Hey, Jesse, get set. Hustle to it fellas. It's just like being back in the jungle, huh? Come on, porch monkey, swing! Yeah, do it! One more thing. Jesse, you wanna tell me what was so interesting about the goddamn football team? I don't know, Coach. I just got distracted. Oh, you got distracted? See, that's what I'm talking about. You can't get distracted. You understand? What the hell is this? All right, Larry. Finish this up now. I got boys who need to shower. Yeah, one sec, Coach. I'm not quite through yet. Sit down. Everybody, sit down. Sit down! Larry, hustle these niggers out of here. You hear me? Get 'em out! If you get your head turned by a few gorillas in warm-up pads here at home, how are you gonna hold up in Michigan? Who the hell is he calling ""gorillas,"" Coach? Coach Snyder! Hey, look at me! Coach Snyder. A lot of people show up for the Big Ten meet. Coach Snyder! Not all of them are gonna be on our side, you understand? Do you? Do you? You gotta learn to block it all out! It's just noise! That's all, all this is! All it is, is noise. You hear me? They will love you or they will hate you. Does not matter. 'Cause either way, when you're out there, you're on your own. Jesse! Do you hear me? Yeah. Yeah, Coach, I hear you. Good. About time. All right, come on. Let's go. You heard Coach. They need the locker room. Right. Come on! Move it! Let's go! Jesus Christ, Snyder. Why you always have to complicate everything? Thanks for your patience, Coach. Locker room's all yours. What in the hell was that, Coach? Okay, Dave. All right. Let's see it. That was for you. No, that was for you, shorty. No, I'm good, Mel. Come on. You believe it? Yeah, I saw. You jump like my sister. Like your sister? Matter of fact, my daughter can make that jump. She's three years old. Yeah, she's three inches taller than you. Come on now. Hey, shorty, show us what you got. Come on, Jesse. Hey, what would Ruth say? Come on, Jesse. Ah, make her proud now. Yeah, shorty! One jump. One jump! You better lower that. I don't think... No, pick it up. Pick it up now. Come on now. Higher. Don't be shy. I don't know what he was thinking, though. Right. Mmm-hmm. Who's that? I think that's his coach. Coach. Yeah? I'm fine. Two days, and I'll be right as rain. You've got three days. Three days from now, we go to Ann Arbor with or without you. Got it? Goddamn it. What were you doing? Training. Fell down some steps. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Ferry Field here in Ann Arbor, Michigan, for the finals of the Big Ten track and field conference of 1935! Hey, go get dressed. I'm scratching you. You can't run. Coach, I'm fine. I'm good. For God sakes, you can barely walk, Jesse. Come on. Coach, just let me do the 100. You wanna pull me after that, then fine. What? No. No, no, no. No, you run with an injured back, you could be out for months. All right? Forget it. Coach, let me do this. The three days did the trick. I'm good. It'll only be seconds. Better be faster than that. Go. Ladies and gentlemen... The first sprint final of the day, the 100-yard dash! Negro! They will love you or they will hate you. Does not matter. 'Cause either way, when you're out there, you're on your own. Set. Hey, kid, you did it. You did it. I was slow off the start. No, no, no, no. 9.3 seconds. That's a record, kid. 9.3 seconds! 9.4. What are you talking about? 9.4, Larry. No, I clocked it myself at 9... You know the rules. What rules? We have to go with the higher time. What are you talking about? What do you mean, ""the higher time""? We got two out of three agree. Okay, then, what's the problem? Will you calm down? Do you understand? I'm not gonna calm down till you come to your senses and give us the record! We're going with the higher time! That's ridiculous! You gotta be kidding me, Phil! Look! I see it, Coach. Up next, on the broad jump, we have from Ohio State University, Mr. Jesse Owens. What's he doing? What do you mean? He's getting a feel for it. Excuse me, sir. Uh, how far did you say that Chinaman could jump? What, whoa. Mr. Nambu is, uh, Japanese. His world record stands at feet and two inches. Do you have a handkerchief I could borrow? Thanks. Now he's just showing off. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world record. Twenty-six feet, eight and one quarter inches! Twenty-six feet, eight and one quarter inches! Here you go. Whoo! Mr. Jesse Owens sets a new world record with a time of 20.3 seconds! 20.3 seconds! This is unbelievable! Jesse Owens has smashed another world record... With a time of 22. seconds! Three world records set and another tied in just minutes! Is there anyone who can beat Owens now? Jesse! Jesse! Jesse! It's okay. You can say it. - Say what? - Whenever you're ready. Long ride back to Columbus. Take your time. Yeah, you're gonna have to help me out here, Jesse. I don't know what you're talking about. Really? Yeah. How many other natural speed men you trained just set three world records in a single meet, hmm? Injured. Four, if you count the 100. I'll tell you what. It gets worse than that. Oh, yeah? Yeah. You also shattered the Ohio State record for most points in a single year, so congrats. Really? Mmm, yes, really. Which cracker did I take that off of? This cracker. Yeah. I had that record for years. Eleven years, and you left me in the dust. Yeah, well, you know what they say about records, don't you? No. What do they say? Some kid, come out of nowhere, snatch the record off of you, just like that. Oh, that saying. Yeah. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. No, you did good. Real good, Jesse. That was something to watch. Yeah, well, I'll tell you what. You stick with me, I'll make a great coach out of you. Frank Wykoff took gold in Amsterdam in '28, and again in '32 right here in LA. Him and Draper, they're the best Cromwell's got, which make them pretty much the best in the country, so... Are you listening to me? Yeah. Yeah. Coach, I already took Wykoff. Yeah, well, this... That's Eulace Peacock. Peacock took the meters and the broad jump in Philadelphia. He's a driver, not a floater like you. It's ugly to watch, but he goes down that track like a freight train on fire, and he's got a hell of a finish. Him, you need to watch out for. He clocked at 9.5 against Villanova. There you go. He's slower. A tenth of a second slower, Jesse. Two-tenths, Coach. Mmm-hmm. Relax. I won't let you down in front of Cromwell. Mr. Owens. One picture, please! Mr. Owens, we have a couple of questions for you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy. Come on, let us through. How does it feel to be the world's fastest human? Excuse me. Excuse me. Owens. Good afternoon, and welcome to Los Angeles, where the great Jesse Owens, no doubt, hopes to make good on his unprecedented streak of four world records. I'm telling you, the skirt in LA... They must be putting something in the water. Who drinks water? Forget it, shorty. You might get a girl like that to dance, but you'll never get her into bed. You're Jesse Owens. Yes, yes, ma'am. Like to dance? Come on, Jesse. Go! Oh, no, I, I got a girl. Where is she? I'll dance with her too. She's in Ohio. I like her already. Whoo! Go, Jesse. Go on, shorty! So, how come it's Jesse? Excuse me? You're The Buckeye Bullet. Born James Cleveland Owens, September 1913, in Oakville, Alabama. You've won eight out of eight events since you got here, and there's nobody that can touch you in the west coast, east coast, or straight down the middle. What I don't know is, why Jesse? Uh, well, it's actually ""JC."" My elementary school teacher, she misheard on account of my accent. I never had the heart to put her right. That's too bad. How so? A big heart can get in the way. Of what? All kinds of fun. Allow me to say how pleased we all are we have met your expectations. Everything looks swell. Let's keep it that way through next summer, hmm? The AAU is set to decide on US participation in the games at its December convention. That's right. I wonder, Avery, do you really think America will withdraw? Well, we have to vote. That's what a democracy is. Yes, of course. The minister Goebbels merely asks for reassurance we can count on your support. Oh, I've made my position clear. In the meantime, might we ask that you grant us the benefit of your considerable experience in construction, and review these plans of our new embassy in Washington? You know, last time I looked, I was worth close on 15 million. You tell him I can't be bought. You can't afford me. A bribe? No. No. A business proposal. The minister would be greatly obliged to you. There aren't many companies like yours that could handle a project of this size. Well... The architect is Albert Speer. Hmm. Impressive. But these towers won't pass DC zoning laws. You can't build higher than feet. You see, this is exactly the kind of expertise we need, if you're interested. Whoo-wee! I am beat. You look beautiful. Just be glad we weren't on the bus. My daddy didn't buy me this car to watch me take no damn buses. Uh, Mr. Owens, sir. Telegram. She can't sue you, Jesse. How is she gonna sue you? And for what? Breach of promise? What does it even mean? It's a threat. That's all. She's just angry. Hello. Mr. Solomon? It's Jesse. Jesse, what you want, boy? Well, can I speak with Ruth, sir? She don't wanna talk to you... I understand that, but if you just give me one second to exp... Don't call here no more! If she would just... Jesse. Go, Jesse! You can do it! Take your mark. I'm gonna beat you, boy, like I was your daddy. Set! Eulace Peacock has beaten the world's fastest human, Jesse Owens, with an incredible time of 10.2 seconds. Hi. You alone? Mmm-hmm. Hmm. So, you, uh, you wanna tell me why you lost today? I thought that was your job. I know how you lost. You looked for him at meters, and it cost you the race. He's got no goddamn business beating you. Who, Peacock? Yeah, or Metcalfe. Yeah, well, it happened. All right? I had a bad day. Look, I'm tired, Coach. We've got a 15-hour ride back to Ohio. I just wanna drink my beer and get some rest. Hmm. Actually, if you keep losing like you did today, that boat's going to leave for Berlin without you. You know what, Coach? If this is going to be another one of your sob stories, then, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather just hear it tomorrow. Look, Miss Nickerson seems like a... Nice enough gal. I don't judge what you do, just as long as you feel all right about it. The choices you're making right now won't even feel like choices, until it's too late. You ever been married, Coach? Yeah. Our little girl's all grown up now. Turns next year. My wife and I are taking some time off. She told me, ""You can't have two families. ""There's no room on the team for us."" Think track and field's hard, you should try marriage. I'd like to give it a shot. Good for you, kid. You never told me you had a daughter. You never asked. Hurry up. I wanna get to Des Moines by morning. Look, Quincella. You are, you're an amazing girl, truly. And it's, it's been a real... Screw you, Jesse Owens! I hope she's worth it! I've got to see Ruth. I've got some explaining to do. Mmm-hmm. Good luck with that. Ruth? I'm so sorry, Ruth. I... Look, I swear I'm gonna... Do you remember the day we first met? I carried your books home from school? And the whole way, we was... We was talking about this and about that, and what we wanted out of life, and what we didn't. Do you remember what I asked you at your door? You asked me to marry you. And do you remember what you said? I said we should wait. Well, I'm done waiting. I wanna marry you, Minnie Ruth Solomon. I did then and I want it twice as bad now. I'm a fool. When that boy asked me to marry him, I should've said yes. But you ain't him no more. Now, go on and get out of here. Ruth... Get out of here! You keepin' all these people waiting. Just get out, Jesse. Get out! Whoo! Look at all this rain. What do you think you're doing? Waiting to walk you home. You been out here all day? Yeah and I'll be out here all day tomorrow, too, all week if I got to. Then you'll just miss your damn races. I don't care about that. I just wanna run, I can do that right here in Cleveland. Jesse, you wanna work in a service station the rest of your life? Well, if it means I get to be with you. Oh, you're smooth. Yes, you are. Marry me. You crazy? Right now, let's do it. My parents hate your damn guts. You left me with our daughter, Jesse. It's a little late to make an honest woman out of me. Look, I'll square with your parents. Just say yes. Say you'll marry me. Where are we gonna get married, Jesse? You think there's a decent Christian minister in this town who'll do it? I haven't thought about that yet, but I'll find a place, I swear. It's just us, Ruth. It's always been just us. All right. I'll marry you. Where you going? I gotta go find a guy to do it. I'll see you later! Gentlemen, today we make a profound decision. It is a complicated decision. For all of you, I know. A vote today against our American athletes participating in these Olympics is a vote against tyranny. Anybody who competes, in any event, any level, knows that on any given day, you're going to win or you're going to lose. What matters is you were there. When it's all over, everybody goes home. History remembers the winners. Every man or woman on that field is grateful for the chance to be there, to meet in the spirit of friendly competition, man against man, nation against nation, to test themselves without fear or rancor against the best the other side has to offer. Surely we all agree the Olympic code is a direct antithesis to Nazi ideology. They're who we ought to be thinking about. Our athletes, those putting their sweat, their blood, their heart into getting that chance. I don't feel I have the right to take it away from them. I know when I was competing, I wouldn't have wanted it taken from me. And whether they bring home medals or not, they'll all have won that chance. I urge you to vote today not with your hearts as sporting men. ...to tell their children... ...but with your conscience... ...and their children's children... ...as members of the human race. ""I was there."" What happened to you? Is that the, uh, Citizen? Come here. Let me see it. Fifty-eight to fifty-six. Congratulations. I respect their decision... ...but in all conscience, I can't be the one to carry it out. Go get us that gold medal, you hear? Yes. Hey! Hey! How about that, huh? Hope you win, Jesse! Go, Jesse! Good evening, y'all. Evening. Jesse, this is Representative Davis of the Ohio State legislature. He's here on behalf of the NAACP. The what? The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Oh, well, hello. This is my wife, Ruth. Hello. Have a seat. Our secretary, Mr. Walter White, has asked me to deliver this to you personally with his best wishes. All right. What's this about? I want to congratulate you on your many recent successes. I've been following them with great and particular interest. As all of us in our community have. Well, thank you. And, uh, the Olympic trials, well, they're coming up soon. Yes, sir. A little under five weeks. Well, no doubt you hope to qualify and take part? Well, yeah. I mean, yes, sir. Even under the Hitler regime? On behalf of Mr. White and his organization and the Negro community across America, I hope you don't go. But this is the Olympic games. I mean, Jesse's been training for this his whole life. Look, Jesse, you're the best. You have a chance to strike a powerful blow. I know that it must sound hypocritical for any American to talk about racial bigotry in other countries, but that is the whole reason we must not go to these games. We've got a chance here to show our solidarity with the oppressed people of Germany. It's all a part of the same great hatred. We can make those in power aware of their moral obligation to fight against the wrongs that we Negroes suffer right here at home. You think it's gonna make a damn bit of difference? He stays, they ain't gonna notice. He goes, he can come back with a drawer full of medals, and they will hate him even worse than before. J.C. Do what you want, now. You understand me? It ain't gonna make no difference no how. Do you run, Mr. Davis? Do I? Well, um, not competitively, no. Figures. 'Cause you know, out there on that track, you're free of all this. The moment that gun go off, can't nothing stop me. Not color, not money, not fear, not even hate. There ain't no black and white. There's only fast and slow. For those seconds, you are completely free. Now, here you come telling me I can't do it, that I'm letting down my race if I go. What's that supposed to do for me? God gave you a great gift, Mr. Owens. Maybe he can tell you what to do with it. You don't have to tell them what's on your mind. He's my coach. I gotta say something. Joe is ahead as we go into round four of this 15-round bout between Joe Louis, the Brown Bomber, ad ex-heavyweight champion Max Schmeling... Hey. Hey! Guys, come on. You're missing the fight. Get over here. Come on, let's go. ...just a warm-up for Louis. Louis hardly seems to know what he's doing. He's dazed, hurt, fighting mechanically. Come on, come on. Louis is down. Get up. The official timekeeper is counting the seconds across the ring. That's it. It's a knockout. - What happened? - The Nazi beat him. He beat Joe Louis. I don't believe it. Well, there's only one thing to do now, right? We go over there in three weeks to Berlin, we get some payback in their house. Am I right? That's right. Alvin Kraenzlein. Alvin Kraenzlein. The greatest athlete that this country's ever produced. Kraenzlein's the only track and field athlete to ever bring home four medals from a single games. Now, me personally, I may not get to beat Alvin Kraenzlein, so I guess I'll just settle for coaching the guy who does. Shorty won't get four. You seen the way he go over them hurdles? I'm not going. Like a bullfrog with his ass on fire. What did you say, kid? Huh? I said I don't know if I can go. To Berlin? What the hell are you talking about? I mean, well, think about it. I go down to Berlin, it's like telling them Nazis it's okay, like I don't care nothing about what's going on over there. Hey, I get it. You're nervous, kid. No, Coach. Look, I've thought this through. Now, come on. You're going, okay? Trust me. Believe me. You're going. That's it. All right? You've worked too hard. And if you don't go over there, you're gonna feel awful. All right? If you were to pull out now, you... Yeah, I know. I'll regret it for the rest of my life, right? Exactly. Yes, sir. And my wife, she'll walk out on me, 'cause she realizes what a loser I really am. And I'll probably end up drinking myself stupid until my coach, he gets so sick of the sight of me that he gives me a goddamn job! Larry! You get a chance to be a part of history, and you're gonna walk away from it, huh? Throw it away? Look, I got people looking at me for an example. What do you mean, people? What people? Black people? Come on. I don't give a shit about any of that! Yeah, well, you're white! You don't have to! Come on. It's okay. Mmm. Ah! What happened to you? Look, you're right to be angry. I've, uh, never been good at listening. They're asking too much of you. A man competes to prove something to himself. That he's the best he knows how to be. Nothing else matters. It just... Jesse, I don't know anything about the kind of pressure that's being put on you right now. But I do know what it's like to be an athlete. And I know that if you don't go, it's gonna feel like the biggest mistake you ever made in your life. Maybe. But you gotta let me make it on my own. All right. You don't have to decide anything just yet, but at least do the trials. Qualify. Give yourself the option. It has been quite a day for you here in New York, Mr. Owens. You have qualified in three events, the and meter sprints and the broad jump. I'd like to ask the coaches, who are the guys you've gotta beat? Well, Carl Long, the broad jumper. We're keeping a real close eye on him. And, you know, I mean, the guy's got every damn record in Europe. Mr. Glickman, Mr. Stoller, as Jewish Americans, did you ever feel pressure not to take part in these games in Germany? For the record, the only pressure they're under is winning their races. We don't discriminate on the US Olympic team. I think we've heard enough about politics today. We're here to talk about medals. They need to answer the question. Mr. Owens, so, does this mean you're going? How can you justify taking part in Germany when there's so much discrimination here at home? You know, that's a very good point. When we get our own house in order... Whatever you need from me, wherever you need me to be, whatever you need me to do. I just wanna help. Well, that's, uh, very nice of you to offer there, Larry, but, uh, you're not an official American coach. Yeah, but you don't know Jesse like I do. Now, Mr. Owens is not the only runner coming with us, and this isn't our first games. Jesse Owens can beat any sprinter over any distance, and you know it. You can't afford to have him off his form. Oh, so you're saying he needs the best coach. Is that what you're saying, Larry? Thanks all the same. You should know he may not get on that boat tomorrow, and there's nothing anybody can do about it. I couldn't believe when I heard you got injured, Eulace. How's the leg holding up? It's good! It's loose. Yup, tore the hamstring right up. But I'm training again, so a couple months... It's shot. It's over. For me. I read the papers. All them people yelling and screaming at you. It can really get in the way of a man's concentration, but all that means is there's a lot of people counting on you. To do what? To get on over there to Berlin and stick it up Hitler's ass! Courtesy of Eulace Peacock. Ruth. Ruth. What'll she think of me if I don't go? You're her daddy. She gonna love you no matter what. And what'll you think? Don't put this on me, Jesse. I promised you a better life than what we have now. I mean, how else am I supposed to get it? I like our life just fine. You're the only damn person in the world whose opinion matters to me, and you ain't got one. I ain't gonna tell you what to do, Jesse. That's why you love me. Jesse? Say I go. What if I lose? You're the fastest man on the Earth. But you won't be there. My family won't be there. My coach won't even be there. Larry's not going? No. He tried, but they won't let him. I'm gonna be there all by myself, the whole world watching. And if I lose... If I lose, it'll mean those Nazis were right. Quit thinking so much, Jesse. It's not what you're good at. You was put here to run. Don't listen to any of them. Listen to you. You listen to your heart, all right? Okay? Ruth, I have everything, all right? I'm sure. Now, I'm always saying goodbye to you. Yeah, well, that just makes it that much sweeter saying hello. Now, here you go, sweet talker. So you remember where to keep looking. Give Daddy a hug! I love you both. I love you. You get your sea legs yet? Coach? What the hell are you doing here? I mean, someone's gotta keep an eye on you. Can't have you laying around all week getting fat. No turning back now. I'm gonna go find my room. Coach. You're headed the wrong way. Everybody's in first class. Yeah, not on my own dime. No, I, uh, be staying down in steerage with you and Dave. See you in the morning. You're kidding me! How do you do? Let's go, Jesse! Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Reich chancellor Adolf Hitler and the German Olympic Committee, welcome to Berlin. Here, take a flower! Thank you! Come on, Marty. Shalom! Uh, sir, where are the colored dorms? There are no colored dorms. We're with y'all? Now, don't worry. We'll keep the noise down! Well, well, well. Food's good too. Maybe these Nazis just got a bad reputation. We'll see. That's Luz Long? Uh-huh. The man can jump. Yeah. He's got a hell of a home-field advantage, too. What do you think this is? Mardi Gras? Get back to work! You got something you wanna say to me, boy? Hmm? Now, hold on a second. ""You're not fit to train fleas on a dog."" You actually said that to Dean Cromwell? Hey, you hear the mouth on this boy? Now, Dean, hold on a second. Don't know what you're teachin' him, but it sure as hell isn't respect. All right, all right. Now, what's this about? What is it you want? I want a goddamn apology. That's what I want. Jesse. Jesse, what do you want? I wanna be able to train the way I'm used to. Oh, for God's sake. And I want my coach back. You're out of your mind. No way. That's out of the question. Mr. Snyder is not a registered Olympic trainer. All right. Well, I hope you know all the words to the German national anthem, because you'll be hearing it every time one of those Nazis win a medal I would've won. You wanna quit? You go ahead, because no Negro is gonna talk to me that way... Hey, hey. Now, what the hell's that got to do with... That's got everything to do with it. Oh, come on. You're making it about that. You weren't there. You didn't hear what he said to me. Enough. Jesse, you don't mean that. You're not about to walk out now? Okay. Okay, fine. Look, if we can get a pass for Mr. Snyder here, we can put all of this behind us. Hey, Jesse? Yeah. You better keep your boy on a leash. Dean. What the hell was that all about? What? What? I figured you couldn't afford a decent seat. I thought I'd help you out. And here I am thinking this is your way of thanking me. I wouldn't even know where to start. Bring me three gold medals. That's the only way. Come on. Hey, how are the new shoes I ordered you from England? They never showed up. Hi. You know where this is here? Hello, hello. Never mind. Sorry. Excuse me. I... Whoa. American. No, I, I'm American. I'm American. American. I'm from the US Olympic team. Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got it, okay? I've got papers. Yes. Here. Here, here, here. American. US Olympic team. I'm, I'm looking for, uh, Dassler. Dassler. Adi Dassler. Dassler? Dassler, yeah. Yes. Yes. Shoe. Yeah. Don't push. Please. Good. Okay. Okay. Here we go. It's gonna be damp out there. The track's gonna be heavy. Yeah? How are the shoes? They're great. Good. Good, good, good. Oh, gosh, I wish you would've had more time to break them in though. I don't know what happened there. I'm gonna get to the bottom of that. That's another... Coach, I said they're all right. You gonna keep fussing like an old hen, or are you gonna let me get out there and run? Mr. Owens, I'm expecting great things. Anything less than a gold, we will consider a disappointment. I'm sure he was joking. Thanks, Coach. You're a lot of help. ...Reichskanzler Adolf Hitler. Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Sieg heil! The winner of the men's 100-meter finals is Jesse Owens in first place with a time of 10.3 seconds. Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Coach! Outstanding! Outstanding! Come on, let me see it. Congratulations. Mr. Owens. Thank you, sir. Now, there's somebody I want you to meet. All right. Here. Hey. Oh! Thanks. Herr Brundage. Hmm. Chancellor Hitler has been forced to leave early today, and won't be able to congratulate the winners. The traffic, you understand. You let the chancellor know he congratulates all of the gold medalists or none of them. Herr Brundage... Regrettably, it is impossible. Then he's... Come on. Time to go over the rules here for tomorrow. You should know they're very particular about their attempts here. So none of that showboating you tried to pull in Ann Arbor. Yeah. You listening to me? We're here at the th Olympiad, bringing you the qualifying round of the men's broad jump event. Up first, the German, Luz Long, reigning European champion. And he's making it look easy! Now it's time for Jesse Owens of the USA. We've seen this before from Owens. He wants to examine the track... Easy. ...before his first attempt. Owens, kneeling on the run-up. Jesse, no! It's a foul! I don't believe it! They've recorded it as a foul! Owens questioning the officials. He's not going to be happy about this! Still, he has two more attempts. Owens makes his second attempt to qualify. Come on, Jesse! Another foul! He stepped over the line! This event looks like it might be over for Owens before it begins. Wait. Here's something you don't see every day. Long seems to be offering Owens advice on where to jump from. Owens, making his third and final attempt. Owens, Owens... He's done it! And Owens is through to the final! Sieg heil! Sieg heil! The men's broad jump final. German chancellor Adolf Hitler takes his seat for the event. And after a close-run qualifying round, the great athlete Jesse Owens of the USA faces up against Luz Long. Each competitor will have three attempts, with his best score determining the winner. Long's first jump. The reigning European champion. It's a white flag. 7.54 meters! Owens... His, too, a white flag! 7.74 meters! Long again. The white flag is up. 7.87 meters. It's a new European record! Yeah! Whoo! Owens... The white flag is up! 7.94! Incredible. Owens has beaten the European record set only moments ago! Let's see what Long can produce to match it. Oh, it's a foul! A foul from Long on his final attempt. But it means Owens has done it! He's secured a second gold medal of the games! That was a great match. Please, take your last jump. What's this? The competition is over, but the German Long seems to share the interest of the crowd here in Berlin, in seeing the best the amazing Owens has to offer. USA! USA! This is the true spirit of sportsmanship we're seeing here between these two athletes today. The white flag is up! 8.06 meters! It's a new Olympic record! Congratulations. Let's make the lap of honor. Okay, sure. Have you seen this before? Never. Thanks. You beat me, square and fair. It's ""fair and square,"" and you gave me the chance. I wanted your best. Otherwise, what is the point? Is that your girlfriend? Yes. Wow. She's very pretty. Thank you. Do they have any ugly girls in Germany? They prefer to keep them out of sight. There are a lot of things they want to keep hidden. You think I'm joking. I love my country, but it's no secret my government's going insane. They don't bother to hide it. I don't even think they are ashamed. A few nights ago, they sent a girl to my room to wish me luck. She wanted to sleep with me. Governor Davey sent me a telegram and a case of Coca-Cola. I should emigrate. No. No. This girl, she wanted to get pregnant. I think she was ordered to get pregnant. I suppose I should be flattered. I think all things considered, you're actually better off in America. I don't... I don't know if there's much difference deep down. Are you gonna get in any trouble? You made quite a scene today. They want to use us to prove something to the world. I'm happy to show them they're wrong. Believe me, I would have preferred to beat you, but it wouldn't have been for them. If they want to make these games a weapon, they can't complain when it's used against them. Maybe now they see how stupid it was to even try. You are entered for one more event, right? Uh, yeah. Uh, meters. I very much hope you win. Not to prove anything to any government. Just to make me feel a little better about losing to you. Conditions have been damp and overcast all morning here in Berlin, as the competitors take to the field for the men's final of the 200-meter dash. This is it. It's been years since a track and field athlete brought home three individual gold medals from a single games. Hans... Taking their lanes are Wil van Beveren, and Tinus Osendarp of the Netherlands, America's Jesse Owens and Mack Robinson, Paul Hanni of Switzerland, and the Canadian, Lee Orr. And they're off to a clean start. Owens has gone off. And so has Robinson. Owens is flying around the top bend into the straight. Mack Robinson in second place. Owens and Robinson ahead of the field. Osendarp is challenging. And it's Owens! Owens sprints it in 20.7 seconds. Owens! Owens! Owens! When we first met, we spoke of hospitality. When you are a guest in somebody's home, you abide... Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand. What time they serve dinner, the brand of cognac they prefer. It's, it's good manners. The Jews, Glickman and Stoller, are competing in the 400-meter relay. It would show a great deal of sympathy and understanding on your part if they did not. Thanks for the drink. He says you have a business arrangement. That was business. That has nothing to do with this. How would it look for your American Olympic Association to have collaborated with us before these games? Okay. There are reports the krauts have been holding back their best runners to spring a nice little surprise on us in the 400-meter relay. With that in mind, we've got some changes to the lineup. All right. So, Foy, guess you'll take third leg. Frank, you're now going to run anchor. Okay. Marty, Sam, I'm sorry, but we gotta cut you. Who's gonna run first and second? You mean we came all the way here, we're not gonna get to race? No, no, no. That's a load of crap. Marty and me, we both licked Foy in the speed test yesterday. I'm sorry, believe me. It's not been an easy decision... Hey, hey. You're gonna cut somebody, you cut him. Foy's got more experience. Any team the krauts got out there, we can win this by yards. Oh, come on! You know what this is all about. We're the only Jews. This has nothing to do with the Jewish question. If you do this... If you do this, you'll catch hell for it back home. That's not your problem. We want to field our strongest runners. And that's gonna be Ralph and Jesse. Come on, that's perfect. No, look. Coach, you gotta run Sam and Marty. I mean, I can't speak for Ralph over here, but you gotta give 'em a shot. I've never even ran the relay. I don't even think I know how to pass a baton. You do as you're told, Owens. Press have copies of the lineup. You change it now and we lose, they'll wanna know why. That's a lot of pressure to put on one race, don't you think? Would you remind me who you are again? Ralph, you do what you want. I'm not running. Not unless Sam and Marty say it's all right. You ever fly in an airplane? No. Nothing in the world like flying your own plane. A girl down in New Jersey, waiting for you. See, an airplane gets people excited the same way they come out and watch a man race. But what they really want, what really gets them worked up, is to see you crash. To see you fold up that Stearman biplane like a piece of paper. Watch the ground crew drag you out like a rag doll before it blows up, explodes into flames. Now, that's exciting. Well, is... Is that why you didn't go to Paris? Because you crashed your plane? April, 1924. Three weeks before the opening ceremony. I heard Paddock win on the radio. Man! Yeah. You were some kind of idiot. That's exactly what my father said. I woke up in the hospital, and he gave me this. Yeah. Yeah, I had my shot, but I didn't know it. Just threw it away. A Stearman's a beautiful little plane, but I don't imagine it compares much to running at the Olympics. You're right, you know. It's not your race. Hey. If you lose, it's for nothing. Understand? Sam and me would've been shafted for nothing. All the world will see is another Nazi waving another medal. What are you trying to say? He means don't lose. Yeah. Come on, Jesse! Owens, the world's fastest sprinter sets a terrific pace from the start. Owens passes Mariani, hands off to Metcalfe. Faster, passing the Canadian. The second change! Go, Frank! America in first place with a new world record of 39.8 seconds! All right! USA! USA! USA! USA! Thanks, Larry. All right. Go! Go! Go ahead. Take a look. No, it's okay. You sure? Yeah. Last chance. Bring it to me. Hmm. What... Excuse me. Mr. Owens, my name is Leni Riefenstahl. Um... I have a favor to ask you. Would you mind one more? Last time, I promise. Well, sure, but isn't that cheating? Cheating? Yeah. I'm just saying that's not the actual jump I made. You did make that jump. We all saw it. You made history out here. All I'm doing is making sure years from now, those people who weren't there can see it too. So they never forget what you did. One more? Please. All right. One more. Danke. Danke. Wonderful. Here we go. Good evening. Hello, sir. Not bad, huh? Not bad at all! I'm sorry, sir, but your friends will have to use the service entrance. Are you kidding me? You know who this is? Yes, sir. I mean, they're holding the dinner for him. Yes, sir. I'm sorry, Mr. Owens, sir, but those are the rules. Yeah? Yeah, well, your rules are bullshit! You know that, yeah? How about you go inside and get your boss or someone that can actually help us out... Coach, Coach. It's all right. Go ahead. I'll meet you in there. Unbelievable. Jesse Owens! Jesse Owens. I think that's Jesse Owens! Mr. Owens? Yes? Um, would you mind? Sure. Thank you!"
33,2012,Gayby,American,"Jenn (played by Jenn Harris), a yoga instructor, and Matt (played by Matthew Wilkas), a comic book store worker, are best friends from college who are now single and in their 30s. In agreement with a pact they made in their youth, the two decide to have a baby (""gayby"") together, even though Jenn is straight and Matt is gay. Jenn's grandmother set her up with a trust fund if she ever had a child, so Jenn is confident that she and Matt will have the finances to have one. However, Jenn states that she wants to have a baby through natural conception, so the two begin awkwardly having sex. Meanwhile, Jenn is concerned with the stunted life she is living, treated as an underling at her yoga studio. Matt is recovering from a devastating break up with his partner of six years, Tom, who is a rising comic book publisher. Matt finds difficulty in getting back into the dating game and finds himself constantly avoiding awkward run-ins with Tom.
The two friends resolve to reinvigorate their dating lives and achieve their longterm goals—Jenn pushes the idea of innovative ""warm"" yoga classes at her studio, while Matt works on his own comic book, ""Gayby""—about the adventures of a heroic gay baby—to pitch to a distributor. Both receive advice from friends about their goals and the pregnancy attempts—Jenn from her gay co-worker Jamie and her aggressive sister, Kelly, who is in the process of adopting a child, and Matt from his dry-witted friend Nelson, who helps them with their fertility treatments, having been a surrogate father himself.
After dating around, Jenn has a one-off night of passionate sex with her boss's brother, Louis. Meanwhile, Matt meets a divorced, newly out, gay father, Scott, who buys comic books at his store. The two begin a relationship, but Matt is frustrated at how slowly Scott wishes to proceed. Jenn and Matt are later thrilled when they learn Jenn is finally pregnant.
While talking with Louis, Jenn is furious to learn that Louis has a girlfriend and that he cheated on her with Jenn. In trying to defend himself, Louis reveals that their condoms broke during sex, but that he thought Jenn knew and was okay with it. Jenn is devastated by the possibility that the child may not be Matt's after all. Her boss, upon learning that her brother cheated on his girlfriend again with Jenn, angrily asks her to take a leave of absence from the yoga studio.
While attending Matt's birthday party, Jenn hesitantly reveals that the child might be Louis's, which devastates Matt. He asks Jenn to return his apartment key and refuses to speak to her. Falling into a depression, Jenn is visited by Kelly, who tells her that her adoption process failed. She instead offers to raise Jenn's baby, arguing that Jenn is not fit—either in lifestyle or career—to raise a child on her own, and will block the trust fund if necessary. Jenn is taken aback and exclaims that she will be able to raise the child and give it a great life, even if Matt never forgives her and she is forced to raise it alone. Satisfied that Jenn has what it takes, Kelly reveals that the adoption went through and that her offer was a ruse to bolster her sister's conviction.
Jenn returns to work and offers to buy into the yoga studio with some of her trust fund money, securing her future with the studio and furthering her career. Enticed by the opportunity to split the responsibility of studio ownership with someone and seeing that Jenn's ""warm"" yoga has become an immense hit, her boss accepts, and they both agree to restart their friendship. Nelson reads over Matt's comic and convinces him that it is worth submitting to a publisher. Matt finds closure with Tom by finally speaking with him and asking him if he would pass his proposal up to one of his superiors. Tom happily agrees, stating that he is pleased to see Matt is doing better. Though he is excited about this development, Matt is still depressed that the child may not be his. Nelson tells him that even if the child isn't his biologically, it is still his child because he and Jenn wanted to have it together. That it has a loving family is what's most important.
Jenn arrives at the comic book store to ask for Matt's forgiveness, and offers to raise the child with him one last time. Though silent at first, Matt relents and the two make up, preparing for the baby's arrival.
One year later, Matt's comic book is a success and he has furthered his relationship with Scott, who enthusiastically helps care for the baby. Jenn has begun a relationship with one of Matt's straight co-workers and stops by Matt and Scott's place to give them the night off of baby-duty. It is then that Scott tells Jenn of his plan to secretly propose to Matt that evening. After Matt and Scott leave, Jenn cuddles with the baby and says, ""You sure do look like your father,"" leaving the true identity of the baby's father unknown.",6.0,tt2106739,"She looks just like you. Kind of, right? Sure...in the cheekbones. Shut up. - No, shes perfect. - lsnt she? It better go through. It will. The adoption people are gonna love you. So, what do you wanna do?

Wow, I just never thought youd be the first one to have a kid. Why? Cause lm barren? Are you ever gonna let that go? I said like three years ago. Loudly... At my birthday party. I just thought it was the correct term. I meant that when we were younger, you never wanted to have kids, and I always did. Youd have to date a guy longer than five minutes if you wanna have a kid with one. It was five months. Okay? The last three, lasted five to six months. So, yeah, let that sit. Ill be right back. phone beeps Do you mind if I take this text? Its my best friend, Jenn. She just asked me something really crazy. Yeah... I dont really care. Should we just... should we just get right to it? Thats cool. Okay. You know that thing when youre looking for sex on a hook-up site, and you run into someone whos looking for something more, and youre like... this really isnt the place for this.

Yeah, because theyre dying of thirst. - I missed you. - I missed you too. Its been a month. Thats too long. Well, you moved to Brooklyn. Yeah, well-- But I check your status updates every day. You know Brooklyn isnt really that far. And I have an entire floor for my comic book collection, so its actually really cool. So, what do you think? Well, lm thinking about it. Thats why lm here. Thank you. Weve been talking about it forever. Yeah, I know. both Since college, yeah. Were you thinking that youd just want it for yourself, or do you wanna share it? I wanna share it.

Have you been dating again? No... No, not since Tom. Yeah, he wasnt right for you. Well, it took me about six years to figure that out. Takes time. If we did this... should we just call a doctor, and make an appointment or something? No, I dont want to do fertility specialists. I watched my sister go through that. Oh, yeah, poor Kelly. Its so expensive, and I dont even really trust those doctors. They get things mixed up like you wind up with... someone elses baby, someone elses sperm. I cant... I cant deal with that. So then should I just go in the bathroom, jerk off into a cup, put it in a turkey baster or something? No! I dont even have a turkey baster. Well, how do you wanna do this? I wanna do it the old fashioned way. Surprise... Whoa! What? Are you just trying to get some? Gross! What? No! Come on, we did this in college. Yeah, we did it in college, but we were really drunk when we did it. Do you want to get really drunk? And you stopped talking to me for like a whole month afterwards, remember? You showed up at my 20th birthday party crying, and you ruined it. For the millionth time, I am sorry. And I did not stop talking to you because we had sex. Well, then why did you? Who remembers? I certainly dont. Hey, do you think that you can? Can what? Have sex with me? What is this - a dare? Yes, I can have sex with you. You can do it? Yes, I can. Im a guy, I can put it in anything. Okay, then lll get an ovulation kit, which tells you when youre ready. But according to my lunar calendar, Im about a week. And then lll just... come over. You agreeing to this? I think I am. Yeah, then youre just gonna come on over, and were gonna make a baby. I stopped reading Spider-Man ever since he made that deal with the devil. I was such a huge Mary Jane fan. I dont know why they screwed that up. Im sticking to the X Books. At least when Cyclops psychically cheated with Emma Frost on Jean Grey, who we all know is the love of his life, at least there was a little build up. It didnt happen overnight. And they didnt need the devil to magically swoop in and say, oh, suddenly youre not-- Hey, Tom. Hey, Matt. - Hi. - Hey. Its Thursday. What are you doing here? Youre supposed to come in on Wednesdays. I know, lm sorry. I gave up my shift on Wednesdays, so you could come in on new book day. Its cool because, you know, we have a deal, so... So why are you here? Randalls parents are in town. And you know how they re-opened the crown over at the Statue of Liberty? You can go up there now. You should go its great. Whos Randall? Oh, I thought Nelson maybe would have told you. No. I met a new guy. Oh. - Hes Randall. - Oh, cool. Hes really nice. Its been like a month. We met at the gym. Yeah, Nelson didnt tell me. Did the new Wonder Woman come out? It comes out next week... On Wednesday. Would you hold a copy for me? Well, therell be plenty of copies. Only gay guys read Wonder Woman. I read it sometimes. Okay, lll come back on Wednesday and lll pick that up. Yeah, great. Hey, lm sorry. Im sorry that I came in on the wrong day. Is he your Jean Grey? I cant believe you didnt ask me. Our child would be gaymazing. I know, but Matts my best friend. I thought I was. You are my best friend... from work. Can he compete with this? Who could? Show me a picture. Jenn, Linda wants you to run this bill to the post office. She said it needs to go out ASAP. Why cant you do it? Im the receptionist. I have to sit at the front desk and receive. I have a masters degree. Why would I want to be a messenger too? Cant you get someone else to do it? Linda feels that hierarchy isnt what were about here, so everyone has to chip in. This will be waiting for you at the front desk. Fine. How do I always get stuck doing this? Because I took on more classes and more responsibility and made her stop treating me like an assistant. Why are all of his pictures shirtless? He gets hot easily. I cant believe you didnt tell me about Randall. How is you knowing who Toms dating gonna make anybodys day better? Especially mine. - Whats he like? - Who cares? Why dont we keep the focus on you. When are you gonna try dating again? Well, I joined one of those websites and I had a date. What kind of a date? Which website? I am familiar with many websites. I think it was called Buddy Search. Dude Hunt. Yeah, thats it. These sconces are so whimsical and unique. How much for the pair? Those actually dont have a price. If youre interested you can leave a bid, and well get back to you. Unique whimsy is very in... right now. Whats with this beard? Im becoming a bear. Ive decided to explore my butch and masculine sides. Arent those... kind of the same thing? I have no idea. So, youre a bear? Im here, lm bear. Get used to it. Woof... Paw. You should try something new. Well, hows this for new? Jenn asked me to have a baby with her. That is so Brooklyn. Im actually getting a little tired of lesbians asking me to father their children. But the genes are good, girl. Jenns not a lesbian. Really? - Yeah, shes not. - Really? Yes, shes not a lesbian. Did you say yes? Yes... Were gonna do it tomorrow. Wow. Do you wanna borrow some porn for the doctors office? I downloaded all this amazing 70s stuff. Its all mustaches and no condoms. Were not gonna go to a doctor. Were gonna have sex. Now that is whimsical. Have you had her tested? Shes fine. Its been discussed. She hasnt had sex in a while. Well, its nice to see youre re-opening a closed location in these troubled times. Should I take my bra off? Oh, God, no,.. Unless its uncomfortable for you. I dont have to do anything with them, do l? No, no, no, no, no, no, no... Its fine. Good. Covers... I shaved my legs... but then I realized I probably didnt have to. Did you... wait a little bit since the last time you... got off? People say that when you wait a couple days... theres more... Oh, thats not really a problem for me. Oh. I mean, some guys actually say its too much. I think that the amount will be perfect for this. Okay. Im gonna take my underwear off. Oh, yeah, me too. - So, I was thinking... - Uh-huh. Um, that I could get started... you know, outside... over here... and get it ready... and when its just about to happen, I could roll over and... pop it in? Yeah, that sounds like a plan. I wanted to mention though, I read somewhere that... if you enjoy it too, then theres more of a likelihood that youll conceive. So, if you wanted to do that on your side... while lm doing it on my side I can probably do that later. In the bathroom, by myself. Im better by myself. Okay. Okay. Hows it going? Its beginning to respond. Can I peak? Im wanna peak. Im peaking. Oh... I forgot how big you are. Come on, Jenn. You are so big. Jenn, you dont have to do that. Im not a straight guy. You dont have to stroke my ego. I mean its kind of true... but lve seen bigger. Toms was huge. Is that who youre thinking about right now? It actually might be a little bit easier if you didnt talk. Im sorry. panting - Okay. - Okay? - lts happening. - Okay. - lm gonna come in. - Okay. - lm coming in. - Dont impale me. - lts gonna happen fast. - Let me guide it. - All right, here we are. - Yep. Ahhh... - Okay. - Yeah. How many times do you think we should do it? Five? Lifting up the right leg. Hips squared. moaning moaning Oh, my, youve gone full-on daddy but without the whole old guy who used to be hot thing. - Hey, bear. - Woof. So how was proving to yourself that you could still do it with a woman? It was surprisingly easy. We did it a couple days in a row. It seemed so early for a mid-life crisis, and yet here we are. Youll be happy to know that lm off duty right now. Until next month. Then lets find you a man. You need to cleanse your palate after all that puss. - Excuse me. - Hi. Can you help us out? Sure, whats up? Im looking for some comics for my son Parker here. Parker... Like Peter Parker? Do you like Spider-Man? No. Okay... What kind of books do you like? I like the Fantastic Four. Remember that cartoon? What does the Thing say? Its clobbering time. Thats so cute. Do you have a kids section? But no Spider-Man - we are boycotting Spider-Man, right? Yeah, its over near there near the action figures. - Thanks. - Sure. Say... Wow, young daddys kind of hot. Straight guys are not hot. Were gay. We like gay guys. We have self-esteem today. Oh, so thats why you lower your voice like three octaves every time you meet someone cute? What can I say - lm naturally deep-voiced. I have to fight to be this way with you. Well, youd never know. Can we go get lunch now? I want to eat myself fat. Jenn, Linda wants you to pick up her laptop at Tech-Place. They saved her drive. Okay, lm on it. She said, no rush. Just before five would be great. Valerie, I was working on some new class ideas, and I thought that we should offer prenatal. But pregnant women arent supposed to do hot yoga. But people have babies in the desert all the time. But those people live in the desert all the time, so theyre used to it. Well, I have a few clients who would really be into it. Really? I dont know. Just dont forget the laptop. Already did. Hey, lm out. Youre pouting. Whats wrong? Valerie thinks that pregnant women cant handle hot yoga. Maybe shes right. Are you gonna keep teaching once you are? I do hot yoga all the time. Ill be fine. You will. But we dont want your baby coming out all twisty and toasty like a pretzel. Oh, my God! You should name him Pretzel! - What if its a girl? - Pretzelle. No, no... Lady Windermere. - I have to go. - Bye. How long is it supposed to take? I think it said to wait two to five minutes. But I dont want to just stand here and stare at it. Oh, my God... Were gonna know really soon. I know. Hey, you wanna go outside on the roof and smoke? I bought a pack of cigarettes when I bought the test. We shouldnt smoke. I mean, I can. But you shouldnt cause you might be pregnant. But our parents all smoke. Yeah, I blame all of my lack of focus on that. Well, you can smoke for the both of us. No. Im just gonna hold it... In solidarity. Im just freaking out a little bit. What were we thinking? We cant have a baby. We cant afford to have a baby. Even if I sold all of my comics, we couldnt afford to have a baby. Ill have some money. What money? My grandmother left me some money in a trust, for when I have my first child. If, and when. Did you do this for money? No! No, I didnt do this for-- I didnt not think about it. How much money? Its enough money. But its for the child, and you know my sisters going to make sure of that. But I didnt do it for the money. I did it because we are going to have the fiercest gayby ever. Do people still say fierce? I think that actually both parents have to be gay, in order for the baby to be a gayby. Please, lve been a hag since birth. Okay, we should check, shouldnt we? No. Not just yet. You know, it doesnt matter... because if its a yes, then great; and if its no, then well just do it again. - Really? - Yeah. Were gonna have our baby. Maybe this place isnt conducive to creating life. We could try my place next time. Yeah, still, its so dreary. You really want this too, dont you? I do. Ive always wanted to have a kid. You know that. How else am I gonna do it? I started a new graphic novel. Oh. Its about a baby, or a gayby, whos a baby by day, and a superhero by night. You should show it to one of those comic book bigwigs who shops at your store. Yeah, I would... but I took the day off when most of them come in, so I wouldnt run into Tom. You need someone new. You should sign up for online dating. Ive tried online dating. No, I mean the kind where you actually go out on dates. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. Lets both do it. Ill sign up again. Okay. Do you have any pictures with your shirt on? Yeah, I think there are like two. Well, you dont want to come off as too slutty. And dont say you like hiking and camping. When was the last time you went camping? I like to camp. Yeah, camp... Iike you appreciate Valley of the Dolls and Showgirls, but not like in the freakin woods. Well, can we keep hiking? Walking around in Central Park late at night is totally hiking. Sure. Ive never done that in my life, Nelson. What are we gonna make your ad title? What did you use? Nelly Bear, cause my names Nelson and lm a bear. Everyones gonna think Nelly means feminine. Look, lm trying to reconcile my butch, bearded ferocity with my beautiful inner woman in a tongue-in-cheek way. If people on this stupid site dont get it, it is their loss. Okay, okay. Well, then... call me Matt-a-tat-tat, cause lm about to explode onto the dating scene. That works, right? I dont think that makes any sense. I love it. I think its nice, it seems energetic. Im on that site too. Actually, my name is Naomi Malone... on the site. Showgirls. You know, do you think its because like its... No me lm alone? Like her existential angst is so intense that theres no me and shes alone. - Thats beautiful. - lsnt that so intense? Like I thought about it when I saw it the first time. I just like the dancing. Okay. The energy in my apartment is just all wrong. Youre right. Your energy is really murky, yellow. I meant in my apartment. It follows you. Well, what should I do? Oh, we can go shopping and buy some candles, oils, sage. Sage helps you shift. Yeah, lets do all that. But I really need to paint. Oh, you should hire my brother. He paints apartments. Hes really good. Jamie knows him. He takes my 5:30. Hes amazing. We went on that mens healing retreat together. I could set it up for you. Make sure he gives you a good deal. Thanks, Linda, thats really great. No problem, sweetie. You guys should stick around for Beths class. Shes got a really low count. Itd be nice to have some extra bodies. I didnt know she had a brother. Hes actually a pretty serious artist. She never mentions that; and he never mentions her. Weird. Is he nice? Not really. But hes not mean either. Hes like... opinionated and definite, in this very Pollock-y way. Is he gonna splash paint all over my walls? No, Jennifer. He knows what hes doing. Just dont suggest colors to him. He feels the space, and then decides. Okay-- Just meet him. Hes insanely hot. And moderately flexible. Is it weird that I dont know what some of these initials stand for anymore? Well, I think the Q is questioning. Oh, well whats the A? Is it answering? Are they answering the questions? I think it might be asexual? Or like associates? I think it basically encompasses all of New York City at this point. Well, what makes this center special anymore then? Well, they have gay bingo. I dont know. I dont want to do any of these activities. But look - they have your favorite: Gay camping! I dont want to do that. Oh... Gay Republicans. Wow! That is so cool! Nelson, you shouldnt do that. Why? Are you about to tell me theres room for all shades of gay under the rainbow? Cause theres not. I was just gonna say there are some really hot Republicans. I like having sex with people I hate as much as the next person, but I had to give that up in my 20s. cell phone beeps Oh, ooh... I just got my tenth response. Do any of them want to go hiking? How many did you get? What is this, a competition? Since yesterday, total? Sixteen. I am so glad I went bear. And this is the bedroom. So? This place is depressing. Yeah. Can we change that? Id kill myself if I lived here. - Green. - What? I can help. Great. Uh, should we... talk about pay? No, you cant afford me. But lll give you the lowest price, since my sister said youre Jamies friend. Lets not talk about money. Its not cool. Right. Should we... talk about a schedule? I like to keep things loose. Ill come when I feel it. Yeah. Well, maybe you should just take an extra set of keys. Yeah, just put them in my pocket. Im just... Im gonna go to the supermarket. Uh, do you... do you want anything? You know, just lock up when you go. Dark yellow. Oh, you want to paint the door yellow? Your aura. You think too much. Oh, I know. So I was like... giggling Hold up. Its not my fault that you waited until you were to have kids and wound up with a litter. And she had the nerve to call me a bitch, which I found offensive because obviously she was feminizing me, and I do not stand for hate language of any kind. Youre so strong, silent and sexy. Lets make out. Hmm! Uh... Could we keep it above the waist? Come on. I made a promise to myself. Yeah, I didnt promise a thing. doorbell chimes Let me just see who that is. You keep your clothes on. Jenn! Hi. Whats up? Is this a bad time? No, no. Im on a date, but I could kind of use a time-out. Hi. Hi. Jenn, this is... Its Adrian. And this is my friend Jenn, who... she brought a suitcase. Why did you bring a suitcase, Jenn? You didnt get my email? No, when did you send it? Like twenty minutes ago. Oh, I didnt get it cause I had turned my phone off, so I could give my full attention to... Adrian. Matt always forgets names when he first meets people. His mom smoked when she was pregnant. - Jenn. - What? Its true. Oh, and lm having my apartment painted, and its not good for me to be around the fumes when were trying to have a baby. Jenn and I are trying to have a baby. Oh, the city needs more children. So, can I stay for a few days? Yeah, sure. Oh, and I think today is day one. I thought it was gonna be tomorrow, but the thermometer says that its today. That is so my cue to leave. Thanks for getting him ready. Sure. Have fun breeding. Im sorry. It was really good to meet you. sighs Sorry I chased away Adrian. He was cute. Oh, its okay. I have a date every night this week. Its getting hard to schedule because of all the responses. I have a date with one of my two responses. Well, you have him meet you here, missy, because my baby mama doesnt go out with anyone unless I meet him first, you understand me? Yes, daddy. Just before our date he should meet my gay lover. Thats right. Wait, were you gonna have sex with Adrian? No... God, I just kissed him so hed shut up.

So, I mean how could she not be satisfied at home? Thats true. I always kinda had a thing for Johnny. - Oh, yeah, hes hot. - Right? I mean he is the Human Torch. So, is he your favorite? Yeah... I like the way Derington draws his ass. Are you flirting with me? What made you think that? Oh... Im sorry. I feel dumb.

A? A is for ally. Im A. Im ally. I earned that. Dont give that to him. Adam begins with an A. He gets an A in tongue. Yeah, so does Scott. He graduates Magna Cum Hot-tay. Jenn, your sisters here. I put her in Studio B. Hurry it up. My sisters here? Oh, thats never a good thing. Jamie, you have to hold this for a minute. But you peed on that thing. Thats not the side I peed on. But still... Yuck. What is with these ridiculous chairs? We just taught a kids class. Please just dont say kids to me right now. Why? Whats wrong? - Theres a problem with Sadie. - Whos Sadie? The child lm adopting. Come on, keep up here. Wait, I thought her name was Folasade. Yeah, I dont like that. It sounds like Folic acid. Why? Sade for short is so cute. I did give it some thought. Sadie is close enough to her birth name. Yeah, right. Where did you just go? In your head? Oh, nowhere. You just reminded me that I needed to get vitamins. My adoption might be falling apart, and youre worried about your shopping list. Im sorry. They told you it was gonna be a long, drawn out process. But you know its gonna happen. I know. I just cant take much more of this. I really want her to be here, now. Im ready to mother. Look I got this great book so that well be ready when she starts to ask questions. Shes a year old. What questions is she going to ask? We need to be sensitive about the issues that arise when Americans adopt children from other cultures. So I should let her grow up in an orphanage to avoid issues? - Thats not what I meant. - I know what you meant. Im white, shes black, so lm gonna need you to come over and explain it to her. I cant wait. You can teach her about hip-hop and civil rights. Did you just come here to argue? No. Youre going on a date with my friend Peter next Thursday. Youll love it. He is a font of information. Hes been to Africa, multiple times. I dont know. Do not say no to me today. Fine. Ill go. And dont waste money on extra vitamins. Just one good multi is enough. You only need to take Folic Acid if youre trying to get pregnant. Right, right... You just went somewhere again. Did something happen? No, no. Its just all this talk about Fola-- Sadie, makes me want to have a baby too. - Youre so competitive. - Shut up. Well, when the time comes youll go see my fertility guy. Hes the best in the city. Even though he didnt do a goddamn thing for me. I should get back to work. I love you. Its all gonna work out. It better... Or I will start drinking again. Okay, give me that back. Im pretty sure that is the side I peed on. - Gross. And its a no, girl. - Damn. More gay sex for you. Should I go to my sisters horrible Upper East Side doctor? No. But l, in fact, have an amazing gynecologist. - What? Why? - Well, no not like that. I mean he does inspect my vagina regularly, but only in the bedroom. Skipping that for now... You know I hate Western medicine. Jenn, you are not doing that. Youre going to my doctor who practices an Eastern-Western mix. So does mine... in bed. Valerie, what happened in there? You cant just eat kale. Do you think all these are necessary? Well tweak anything that we need to, but call me if there are any unpleasant side effects. Okay. Hows the sex? Oh, you know, it was really awkward at first, but now that we got the hang of it, its fine. Only fine? Oh, hes my best friend. Were only having sex to get pregnant. As if men need an excuse to have intercourse. Right. Hes gay though. Oh. Let me give you something. I make a loose leaf tea with extra horny goat weed. Whats that? Its a weed that goats eat that makes them horny. It has the loveliest of tastes. And it helps increase the sex drive. Getting pregnant can take time, and we dont want you to get tired of having sex. Is there anything to increase my bust size? Yes... Getting pregnant. Oh, I like you. Youre funny. Yes. So you just stick to that list. But apart from that, you just relax. Meditate, be peaceful. Do yoga. Thats what I do. I teach Bikram. Oh, I dont like that. Its too hot. Well, do you think the heat will be bad for the baby? No. Since Lilith, women have been giving birth in the harshest of extremes. Youre gonna be fine. I can see that. Whos Lilith? Gross! Jenn, what is this? Dont drink that! Thats my fertility tea. Well, its nasty. What the hells in it? Its horny goat weed and some other herbs. What is this? Rosemarys Baby? Are you sure its okay to drink that? My fertility guru gave it to me. Shes amazing. I love her. Its so delicious. I love this tea. Ive already had three cups. Theres a male version. You want me to get you some? Thats okay, I dont need any horny goat help. - I gotta go to work. - Okay, bye! Go, go, lock it, lock it, lock up that left knee, and easily pump it out. Yes! Can we do this? Yeah! Loosen it up. Make a circle. Whos got a circle in them? You do! Make the circle. Make it, okay, let it go. Hoo! Shake it out. Right into tree! And to the right...

I felt the bass. You two are just so inspiring. You notice the differences in life. Yeah, thanks. I want you to leave class remembering that. Im just gonna swim on out of here. Over to here. It feels good in here. It feels good in here. Feels good in here... Oh, my girl. A dance break! Yes! Go. And then I started a non-profit building schools in Africa. Amazing.

You woke me up and made me come here and went back to sleep? Get up. Hey. Im so glad that my cats death could help you procreate. Is that what I think it is? Yes, its Miss Lulu Kittys ashes.

I dont know. Ash? Tin? Ashton. - lm gonna get to it. - Go for it. - Do you want to help? - Nope, not into you. - Not even a little bit? - Nope, and not ever. Thats because you loved Tom. Partially... And you hated me when I started dating him. Definitely. But youre still my friend. We work on the same block and youre a good lunch date. Besides, I like that I have one friend that lm not secretly in love with. Thats refreshing and rare for us gays. Thats true. Hug me? No, not this early. Gross. Im gonna go jerk off.

Pregnant women are not into hot yoga. Can I ask you something crazy? Something crazy? As opposed to everything else you say? What about instead of hot yoga - warm yoga? - Lukewarm? - No. Warm-Warm. Like everyone who hates hot yoga could do it. Pregnant women could do it. and theyd still get some of the benefits. Do you think its any good? No... It sounds ludicrous. But its also so stupid, maybe smart people would love it. Yeah... Im gonna take it to Linda. Its crazy, but its also amazing. Its craymazing. I hope so. Somethings different about you. Your energys changed. I dont want to talk about it. Oh, yes, you do. What is it? All the gay sex confusing your feelings? No. We stopped having sex. Were doing the turkey baster method, but with a cat syringe. Did you finally realize how totally bizarre that whole scenario was? No, its not that. I just kind of had sex with someone else, and I just felt really weird about having it with Matt. Who was it? One of these dates? No. Its someone else. No way! Did you have sex with Louis?! Oh, my God! How was it? Tell me everything so I can imagine it was me. You know it was really out of nowhere. It was, like, really intense and... Craymazing, obviously. Yeah, it was also that. But it also just felt really wrong. Well, sure, Jenn. Thats because he has a girlfriend. What? He did not tell me that. - Did you ask? - No, but he didnt offer. Well, he was busy offering something else. Oh, no, now I feel terrible. You should. Home-wrecker. We sold out of the one where he dies, but we have plenty of the one where he comes back to life. No, no... Hes already alive again. Cause theyre making a movie about him so... Hey, Parker! Could you hold on a second? Hi. Hows it going? He cant stop talking about comics. He is hooked. Thats so cute. Hi. Can I help you with anything else today? Okay. Bye. Hi. Hi. So, I know that you said youre busy, but is there any night this week that you might want to go out for dinner or something? I have Parker all week so I cant get away. I wish I could. But, you know, hes gotta come first. I totally understand. This has gotta be super casual. I gotta take things slow. Yeah, slow... Totally. Are you sure youre okay with that? Yeah, of course lm okay. Slow... I can do that. Then hes like, Can you handle casual?  And he has a kid with his ex-wife. Maybe he does just wanna take it slow, but I just... I think lm ready for something more right now-- Whoa, whoa. Can we just take a breath here for a moment? - lm trying. - Hang up. Im here now. Oh, right. Now, first lets take a moment to celebrate the fact that youre freaking out about someone, and its not Tom. Youre right. And its great to hear that. But this doesnt sound all that different. But I really like this guy. Youve been on what - like, two dates with him? And now he says he wants to keep it casual? So you either accept that, or you stop dating him. Theres no in between. I know, I know. Can you do casual? Absolutely not. You cant engage in this. Its just repeating a cycle. They say when its hysterical, its historical. What does that even mean? It means that if youre getting crazy over this guy so soon, it has nothing to do with him, and more to do with how you feel when you think people are abandoning you. Wow. Whered you get that from? Jamie and I read Codependent No More together at work sometimes. Youre very... full of wisdom today. I know. Lets just go with it. So whats going on with your Super Gayby book? Well, the only place thats really good for it is Kapow, and Tom works there now so I cant bring it to him. Matt, come on! You have to stop letting him get in your way. I know. I have to tell you something. - Bad or good? - One of each. Can you give me the good, please? I dont think I can handle the bad right now. At work today I was adjusting a posture, and a woman elbowed me in the breast. And out of nowhere I screamed, Ow, my tit! - Your breasts arent sensitive. - They arent...ever. - Oh... - Yeah. - Really? - Really. I went to Dr. Ushma and she confirmed and everything. - Were pregnant?! - Were pregnant! Oh, my God! Thats amazing! giggling - Wow! I am so excited! - Yeah. Wait, what was the bad thing? I dont remember. It mustnt have been that important. Are you happy? - So much so, yeah. - Me too. Hello, everyone. Im teaching for Jamie tonight. Hey, Valerie. Just find your space, okay? Your space. Just take a minute. Just be by yourself in that space. Yeah, hi. What are you doing here? I take this class every week. Oh, yeah, right. Do you mind? No, no, no... No. All right, take a comfortable seated position, long spine. All right... Lets take a deep inhale through the nose... Just this first time lets take it out through the mouth. Let go of the stresses of the day. Okay? Let go of your job... your pets... Okay? Let go of that confrontation on the subway, let that go. Your boyfriends. Okay? The girlfriends... The girlfriends that you have that you dont tell other girls you have. Lets just let that go. Let us think about responsibility. Okay? That word. About being an adult. Okay? All those really good qualities, even if you dont have them... Lets breathe that in. And lets exhale right on out to warrior two. Lets hold warrior two for a minute. Breathing. Well done. Breathing. Nice. A little deeper. Does it hurt? It should probably not hurt. Keep your head up to the sky. Excellent, excellent, beautiful. Oh, this is nice. This is very balanced. Take care, be well. Dude... Why are you so mad at me? You have a girlfriend? We broke up. I mean, we were broken up that week. We break up a lot. I would never have been with you if we were together. Im not like that. - Really? - Really. We had a connection. And at the time I was free to act on it. Okay. You know it was really... it was fun. Yeah, it was. And lm grateful to you. You helped me. How? After I had sex with you, I realized I wanted my girlfriend back. Are you always this much of a jerk? No, listen, just... Who knows what could have happened? You could have gotten pregnant. Our whole lives couldve changed in an instant. Im not ready for that with anyone else. Great, you couldve told me that in person, instead of leaving me a note... Post-it note. Yeah, that... That wasnt cool. Sorry. Its okay. Thank you for not charging me. Whats different about you? Oh, lm stepping up my work game. Trying to impress your sister. Good luck with that. But... Youre not pregnant though, right? Why are you asking me? We were safe. Yeah, but come on... Come on what? You know the condom broke. Yeah, and then you pulled out and put another one on immediately. Yeah, and that one broke too. And then you put on another one. And that one broke. The last one broke? You did not tell me that! I thought you knew. And it was a little bit too late at that point. Too late? I was finishing. And you were telling me not to stop. I thought you felt it break and didnt care. I care! Then why do you have a box of five-year-old condoms in your medicine cabinet. There was a layer of dust on those things like an inch thick. I havent needed them lately. Look, lm pretty sure that it broke as I was pulling out, so if youre not pregnant by now we have nothing to worry about. No... You have nothing to worry about. You should just go.

I thought he was a jerk. You depressed? Do you want a hug? No. And its not that. Oh. Of course, we used a condom, but it broke. And then we used another condom and it broke...

Oh, my God, this is so not about us. How do you guys know each other? Were bar enemies. She used to troll at the same bar I hung out at. Oh, I trolled, and you hung out? Thats what it looked like. Anyone who was at The Pipe at AM was trolling, including you. Guys, stop. Shes just mad because she and I have the same type but I always got first choice, and she had to settle for my leftovers. And if she believes that, she is out of his mind. Dont you mix my gender pronouns. I will speak in the her person whenever I want. - Deal with it, aging twink. - Feminine bear.

I went to dinner with Tom and his friends last night. Awesome... How is he? Still the same - boring. He got another promotion at work. Everything comes so easily to him. I know, that always drove me crazy. We have actual challenges, but we face them. Like when I quit smoking and got fat, and got too depressed to shave, I turned myself into a bear. - And you-- - Okay... Is this a pep talk? Cause I cant. Look... It does not matter whose sperm it was. That baby is yours and Jenns. Youre gonna make an amazing father. I know it. Could you just not cop out? How much for the pink thing? Thats a mounted ceramic elephantine bust - and not now. Im sorry, lm conversing with my distressed friend. - Bitchy queen. - Yup. And you... Can you just be a father to that baby so it doesnt grow up to be a douche bag Iike everybody else in this city. All the good people have moved. Do you have anything that will make me not want to stay in bed until I die? I can mix something that will improve your mood. Not the horny goat though; that was a disaster. It really is one of the better energy and mood boosters. I dont need that kind of energy. Okay, well leave it out. I have a mood mix. It will give you vivid dreams, but its really effective. But having more energy and a better mood is not gonna solve all your problems. Oh, trust me, I know. Hey, Scott. Its Matt... I got your gift... the broken watch. And I get it. Im cool with taking it slow. As long as slow means that were only dating each other, and no one else. Thats all. Gimme a call, I hope youre good. Okay, bye. Wait... Todays Wednesday, right? Did I come in on the wrong day? No. Yeah, todays Wednesday. So I thought this was your day off. Its okay. I decided to work on Wednesdays now, so I could see all my industry friends who come in on Wednesday. Yeah, I get that. Good, cause, um, I kinda have to ask you to not come in on Wednesdays anymore - if thats okay? When should I come in? Well, Cosmic Comics is only five blocks away. You could go there. Its closer to where you live. I hadnt thought about that... Whats going on with you today? Youre being so...assertive. Well, while lm on a roll, I have a favor to ask you. I finished a book. And I think that Kapow is the perfect fit and... Sure, yes. I dont know why you havent asked me before. Of course. Just send it to me at work. Ill show it to Larry. Thank you. I appreciate it. I think lm gonna go...now. Its good to see you. Im glad youre doing well. Im proud of you, man! Thank you. Did I do okay? Yeah, oh, yeah. Victory. Wake up. We have to talk. I cant. You can get pregnant with a guy or some other guy, but you cant talk to your sister? - Get up! - Wait. Who told you that? Your gay friend. You talked to Matt? - No, the other one. - Jamie? Who can keep track of names with all your gay friends? I mean, having a girlfriend wouldnt kill you. Well, who could live up to you? Shut up. Look... My adoption isnt working out. So...I have a solution. Give me your baby. Wha-- What? You can barely take care of yourself. How are you gonna handle a baby? I do just fine. Do you even have a job anymore after banging your boss brother? Jamie told you that too? He told me everything. I bought him lunch. Hes a cheap date. You know, I can get a new job any day. Lets be real here. I have a husband... with a great job. I have a nursery ready. I can do hair if I want, but I dont need to work. Wait... Are you serious? Yeah, your kid would have a better life with me. Who the hell do you think you are? A baby needs two parents. This baby has two parents. Almost three. But I mean real parents. When Matt forgives me, hes going to be an amazing father. He works at a comic book store like a fat person. Since when does parenting have to do with your job, or your money, or your waistline? How much money do you have? Are you planning on getting yours from the trust? I can block it. Uncle Henry always listens to me. You know that. I dont need that money. I am great at what I do. My latest class is a smash and I can teach it anywhere. And you can raise a baby alone... even if Matt doesnt forgive you? - You really think thats true? - I know that its true. I love this baby. Im going to do everything in my power to make sure it has the best life. Good. Now go take a shower and get yourself together. We have a big day ahead of us. Wait, are you off your meds? Come on, Jenn, its called tough love. Do you really think I wanted your baby? I dont need two. Sade is coming next week. I totally fibbed. Really? Thats so fantastic. Wait, Sade? Its not Sadie? Sade is cooler. Yeah. I think that fight might have been the most amazing thing youve ever done for me. I know. Im fantastic. Now come on. Go get your job and your gay daddy back, so we can shop for our babies all weekend. So, youre not dead. I should kill you for telling my sister... but thanks. Youre welcome. Wheres Valerie? She left to get her PhD. Oh, wow. Is Linda here? Shes in her office. Good luck. Hi, Linda, lm here. Im really sorry I slept with your brother. Ive been trying to get pregnant and I was basically in heat. And we had a kind of an animal moment-- Stop. I dont wanna hear anymore about that. Of course. You know, lm coming into some money soon. Its not a lot, but... I was thinking maybe I could buy into the business, so I can have a stake, and maybe a future here. Oh, thats interesting. I would love to go on vacation. Im ready to do it. You know, your Warm-Warm Yoga idea has really taken off - even with the silly name. Why dont we go to the park tomorrow and get a yogurt and discuss it? That sounds really nice. I always meant to be friendlier. I am jealous of what you and Jamie have. Maybe we could restart our friendship today. Okay. Hey, when you go will you take that package out and give it to Jamie to take to the post office? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Oh, a package. Thats good news. It means you werent fired. Actually, its for you. Bitch. Ill take it. I have my moped. Should you even be riding that thing? Im pregnant... I ride a moped... I teach hot yoga... I rock. Work. Take a day off. And then work. - Work. - Work. Yeah, yeah, yeah... Im gonna get a coffee. Hi, lm Neil. Hi, lm Jenn. Hes really cute. Well, why dont you have sex with him too? Hes single. Matt, lm sorry. I dont want to hear it. Its not about that. About what then? I stopped talking to you in college because the very next night after we had sex, you made out with Josh Spitz, right in front of me. And you were jealous? You knew that I had the hugest crush on him, and you always said you thought he was gross. He was so gay though, Jenn. I have no gaydar. Its my thing. And it seemed like you were doing it on purpose, because you didnt want me to get any ideas about us. No, not at all. I think I was high on ecstasy. - Really? - Yeah. I think I was really, really high on ecstasy and I made out with him because he was standing in front of me. Wow. I was really hurt. I thought it was all about me. You often do. Matt, it is gonna be our baby, no matter what. Damn right it is. You should have just told me right away... and not on my birthday, at my party. I have a new rule - never on a birthday. Never on my birthday. It really was an accident. And I didnt have sex with anyone for months. I blew up at Scott on my birthday. Im really sorry. Ill let you know when lm ready to accept your apology. - Now? - No. - Now? - No! Now? Okay, but only because we have a lot of baby planning to do. Lets do it again. No, I gotta go pump. Can I help? Youve done enough already. Cant you just tell them youre gonna be a little late? No, its Matts birthday. Hi. Jenn, Jenn, Jenn... You know no shoes on this floor. I need that milk, and sanitize. Hey, do we-- Shh... Logans trying to sleep. Hey. You look good. What took you so long? Neils downstairs. We finally had sex. Like a whole bunch of times. Did you use a condom? Whats a condom? Of course we used a condom. Okay, I know you know this, so forgive me, but dont let him stay up past or 8: 5, otherwise hell be up all night. - lm his mommy too. - I know, sorry. Jeez, hes like super-daddy. Thank God. Can you imagine if we had to raise a kid by ourselves? baby coos I absolutely cannot. Me either. Oh, birthday... Happy...birthday. Oh, you framed it! Thats so sweet. Hey, look, look... Its you. And thats me. And thats him. - And thats your mommy. - Thats her! Where should I put it? Just put it right here. Thank you! - Youre welcome. - So much! Love you. I wish you could come with us tonight, but he wants to have the night out alone. He has a surprise for me. I know... I am so excited that hes going to ask you to marry him. What? You looked like you knew. You didnt know? No! I am... a compulsive birthday ruiner. No, its okay. Its more than okay... Okay, guys, we gotta go. We have reservations. Yes. Bye little one. Im gonna miss you. Bye-bye. Wow. You really do look just like your daddy. baby coos"
34,2014,Whiplash,American,"Andrew Neiman is a first-year jazz student at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York. He has been playing drums from a young age and aspires to become like Buddy Rich. Famed conductor Terence Fletcher invites him into his studio band as the alternate for core drummer Carl Tanner. Fletcher is strict and abusive, mocking and insulting his students; when the band rehearses the Hank Levy piece ""Whiplash"" and Andrew struggles to keep the tempo, Fletcher hurls a chair at him, slaps him and berates him in front of the class.
At a jazz competition, Andrew misplaces Carl's sheet music. Since Carl cannot play without it, Andrew tells Fletcher that he can perform ""Whiplash"" from memory. After a successful performance, Fletcher promotes him to core drummer. Soon after, Fletcher recruits Ryan Connolly, the core drummer from Andrew's former lower-level class. Andrew believes Connolly is the less talented drummer and is infuriated when Fletcher promotes him to core. Determined to impress, Andrew practices until his hands bleed and breaks up with his girlfriend Nicole, believing she will hold him back. After a grueling five-hour audition with Fletcher and the other drummers in the class, in which Fletcher kicks furniture and screams at him, Andrew earns back the core spot.
On the way to another competition, Andrew's bus breaks down. He rents a car but arrives late and realizes he left his drumsticks at the rental office. He races back to retrieve them, but his car is broadsided. He crawls from the wreckage, runs back to the theater, and arrives on stage bloody and injured. When he struggles to play ""Caravan"" due to his injuries, Fletcher halts the performance to fire Andrew. Enraged, Andrew attacks Fletcher in front of the audience and is dismissed from Shaffer Conservatory.
At his father's request, Andrew meets a lawyer representing the parents of Sean Casey, Fletcher's former student. Contrary to Fletcher's claim that Sean had died in a car accident, the lawyer explains that Sean committed suicide, having suffered anxiety and depression as Fletcher's student. Sean's parents want to prevent Fletcher from teaching again. Andrew agrees to testify on the condition of anonymity and Fletcher is fired.
Months later, Andrew has abandoned drumming and is working in a restaurant. He discovers Fletcher performing at a jazz club. After the performance, Fletcher invites Andrew to have a drink with him. He explains that he pushed his students so that they might become the next Louis Armstrong or Charlie Parker. Andrew accepts Fletcher's invitation to drum with his band at the JVC Jazz Festival. He invites Nicole to the performance, but she is in a new relationship.
On stage, before the performance begins, Fletcher reveals that he knows Andrew testified against him, and leads the band with a piece Andrew does not know. Andrew leaves the stage humiliated, but returns, begins playing ""Caravan"", and cues the band. As the piece ends and the lights go down, Andrew continues his solo. Fletcher is taken aback, but begins to guide Andrew. As the solo ends, they share a smile and Fletcher cues the finale.",8.5,tt2582802,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No. Stay. What's your name?

Nice to meet you too. - So you wanna take me out. - I would love to take you out. - Where do you wanna go? - Pizza. - Pizza. - Yeah. - I like pizza. - Yeah, I know this great pizza place. Cool. Okay, well... I get off at on Monday. - Okay. - You wanna meet here? - Okay. Yeah. I will. - Yeah. Great. Okay. Seven o'clock? - Here. - At p.m. - Monday. Andrew. - All right. - Bye. - Bye. It's not that bad. She's a go-go dancer. Could've did porn, she chose not to. - That make it better? - Yeah, little bit. - That's classier. - I can deal with that. Bitch had a foot fetish or something. - This is good. - You get on that? That's it. You are fucking kidding me. - You the new alternate? - Yeah. I'm Andrew Neiman. Tune the set to B-flat, then turn my pages. Sure. Excuse me. Could I get a B-flat? Thank you. Sorry. Can you...? Just one more time? That's a great kit. I play the new cymbals now. Milk the cunt! We got a squeaker today, people. Neiman. Nineteen years old. Isn't he cute? All right, gang, ""Whiplash."" Page. Page! Barker, that is not your boyfriend's dick. Do not come early. Bar 93. Five, six, and... Stop. Now, this one really upsets me. We have an out-of-tune player here. Before I continue, would that player care to identify himself? No? Okay, maybe a bug flew in my ear. One-fifteen. Five, six, and... No. My ears are fine. We definitely have an out-of-tune player. Whoever it is, this is your last chance. And there it went. Now, either you are deliberately playing out of tune... and sabotaging my band... or you don't know you're out of tune... which I'm afraid is even worse. Reeds. Five, six, and... Bones. Five, six, and... He's here. Tell me it's not you, Elmer Fudd. It's okay. Play. Do you think you're out of tune? There's no fucking Mars bar down there. What are you looking at? Look up here. Look at me. Do you think you're out of tune? Yes. Then why the fuck didn't you say so? I've carried your fat ass for too long. I won't have you cost us a competition... because your mind's on a Happy Meal instead of on pitch. Jackson, congratulations, you're fourth chair. Metz, why are you still sitting there? Get the fuck out! For the record, Metz wasn't out of tune. You were, Erickson. But he didn't know... and that's bad enough. All right, take 10. When we get back, the squeaker's on. Two, two, three. Two, two, three. If he put half the effort into playing the trombone... Andrew. - Parents musicians? - No. - What do they do? - My dad's a writer. What's he written? I guess he's more of a teacher, really. - College? - Pennington High School. - Your mother, what does she do? - I don't know. She left when I was a baby. No musicians in the family? You just gotta listen to the greats, then. Buddy Rich, Jo Jones... You know, Charlie Parker became Bird... because Jones threw a cymbal at his head. See what I'm saying? Listen, the key is to just relax. Don't worry about the numbers. Don't worry about what other guys are thinking. You're here for a reason. You believe that, right? Yeah. Say it. I'm here for a reason. Cool. All right, man. Have fun. All right, gang, ""Whiplash."" A little under tempo, okay? Neiman, just do your best. Here we go. Five, six, and... Let's hear some fills. We got Buddy Rich here. A little trouble there. Just pick it up at 17. Ready? Five, six, and... Not quite my tempo. Here we go. Five, six, and... Downbeat on 18. Okay? Here we go. Five, six, and... Bar 17, the and of four. Got it? Five, six, seven... Not quite my tempo. It's all good. No worries. Here we go. Five, six, seven... You're rushing. Here we go. Five... Ready? Okay. Five, six, and... Dragging just a hair. Wait for my cue. Five, six, seven... Rushing. Five, six, and... Dragging. Five, six, and... Why do you suppose I just hurled a chair at your head, Neiman? - I don't know. - Sure you do. - The tempo? - Were you rushing or dragging? I don't know. - Start. - Five, six, seven... In four, damn it. Look at me. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three... Now, was I rushing or was I dragging? - I don't know. - Count again. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four. - Rushing or dragging? - Rushing. - So you do know the difference. If you deliberately sabotage my band... I will fuck you like a pig. Now, are you a rusher... or are you a dragger... or are you gonna be on my fucking time? I'm gonna be on your time. - What does that say? - ""Quarter note equals 215."" - Count me a 215. - One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four. - Jesus Christ. I didn't know they allowed retards. Am I to understand that you cannot read tempo? - Can you even read music? What's that? - Eighth note. - Yes. What is that? - Dotted 16th note. Sight-read measure 101. What, are you in a fucking a cappella group? Play the goddamn kit. Stop. Now answer my question. Were you rushing or were you dragging? - Answer! - Rushing. Oh, my dear God. Are you one of those single-tear people? Do I look like a double fucking rainbow to you? You must be upset. - Are you upset? - No. No? So you just don't give a shit? - I do give a shit. - So are you upset? Yes or fucking no? Yes, you are upset. Yeah. - Say it. - I'm upset. Say it so the whole band can hear you. - I'm upset. - Louder. - I'm upset. - Louder! I'm upset. You are a worthless, friendless, faggot-lipped piece of shit... whose Mommy left Daddy when she figured out he wasn't Eugene O'Neill. Who's now weeping and slobbering all over my drum set... like a fucking 9-year-old girl. So for the final father-fucking time... - ...say it louder! - I'm upset! Carl. Start practicing harder, Neiman. ""Whiplash,"" bar 125. Big-boy tempo. Five, six, and... This place is nice. Yeah. I really like the music that they play. - I mean, the food's good too, but... - No, the pizza's really good. ""When I Wake."" - What? - That's the name of the song. Jackie Hill, July 17th, 1938. Bob Ellis on the drums. Every time I saw you at the theater, your eyes were glued to the floor. Really? My dad says that I have... I have trouble making eye contact. My parents like to criticize me too. Growing up, my mom said I had a really big chin... that's why guys wouldn't like me. - Really? You don't. - Yeah. Well, she said my dad cursed me with one. It's like Jay Leno. Look. - No, it's not. - Yeah, it is. - I don't... I don't think so at all. - Well, that's nice. Your chin's very nice. Very nice. Your mom sounds insane. She did wanna be an actress when she was my age. - What about you? - What about me? What do you do? I go to Fordham. What do you study? I don't have a major yet. - But, like, what do you want to study? - I don't really know. I don't know yet. So Fordham was just like a random school? No, I applied to a bunch of schools, Fordham let me in. Why'd you pick Shaffer? It's the best music school in the country. Well, Fordham was Fordham. I don't love it there, to be honest. - No? - No. I... I don't know. I guess it's just the people. I don't know if they like me very much. I'm from Arizona, and I think they can see it. - I feel the same about people at Shaffer. - Yeah? Yeah. I don't think they like me too much. But I don't... I don't... I don't care too much. I think it just... It changes. You know, people change and things work out. No, no, I know, I know. I just... I feel really homesick sometimes. I don't know. It kind of pisses me off when people pretend like they're not. In college, you know? Maybe I'm literally the only one, I don't know. I still go to the movies with my dad. - Hey. How are you, man? - Good to see you. And please, is this really Eva? Last time I saw you, you were very tiny. Are you playing an instrument yet? She started piano last week. When you're a big college kid, will you come play in my band? - Would you like that? - Be my piano player? Excellent. Give me five, baby. - All right. Great to see you. - Great seeing you. - See you after the show. - Absolutely. Cheers. Listen up, Cocksuckers. Hurry the fuck up. Get your music. ""Irene"" only. Set one. Rhythm section out first. The kit is a fucking tonal catastrophe. Get it in tune, all right? Rhythm and soloists, bar 45. We're gonna pick up the tempo. Bar 106, brass, do not forget we sharp that ninth. Everybody remember, Lincoln Center use these competitions... to decide who they're interested in and who they're not. I'm not gonna have my reputation in that department tarnished... by a bunch of limp-dick, sour-note... flatter-than-their-girlfriends, flexible-tempo dipshits. One more thing. Give me that. If I ever find one of these lying around again... I swear to fucking God, I will stop being so polite. Get the fuck out of my sight before I demolish you. Stage right, in order, now. I can still fucking see you, Mini-Me! Let's go. Hurry the fuck up. Let's go. The Shaffer Conservatory Studio Band. Hold on to this for the second set. He's dumb but he's not stupid. At the end of the day, he wants a career, as dumb as he is. Fudd has a chance of getting put back in, so why would he jeopardize that? - I need to look at the music. - It's right here. - Why isn't it on you? - Where's the folder? - You're joking. You're fucking around? - No. I swear I had it here two seconds ago. It's gotta be around here. - Did you see...? - How could you be so stupid? - I know. Maybe a janitor came by. - A janitor? Find the fucking folder! A fucking janitor? You're a dumb fuck! A dumb fuck! - Find the folder! - Okay, I'm sorry. Tanned Jesus fucking Christ, where have you been? - We have an issue. - Okay, now is not the time. I gave Neiman the folder and Neiman lost it. - Neiman lost it. - Yes, sir. The folder was your responsibility. Why would you give it to Neiman? Right? Give a calculator to a retard, he's gonna turn on a TV with it. - Get your sticks, get your ass on-stage. - I... I can't. You can't? I... I can't go on-stage. I don't know the charts by heart. - Are you fucking kidding me? - I... You know this. I need the music. It's my memory, I need visual cues. - Visual cues. - Yes. It's a medical... A medical condition? What, are you Sanjay Gupta? Play the goddamn music. - I can't. - I can. - You know ""Whiplash"" by heart? - Yes. Every measure. All right. Well, you better fucking hope your memory doesn't fail you. I hope you play it a lot better than you did last month. I do not intend to start losing. Get your sticks and get your ass on-stage. On-stage! And in first place... Shaffer Conservatory. Hey. Don't fucking touch my folder, man. Do not touch this kit. All right, let's get to work, ladies. Tanner, what you doing? It's core only. I don't have time for alternates. ""Cherokee."" From the top. Tanner, are you a fucking statue? Let's go. Get off the stool. Don't forget to turn Neiman's pages. Here we go. One, two, three, four. Two, two, three, four. What did you do to your hand? - Is that from drumming? - Yeah. It's nothing. So how's it going with the Studio Band? Good. Yeah, I think he likes me more now. And his opinion means a lot to you, doesn't it? Yeah. Wanna grab the shakers? Jimbo? Overcooked. You can barely chew this. - He just laughs. - So how's the drumming going, Andy? Yeah, it's going really well. I'm the new core drummer, so... - Hey. - Congratulations. Tom Brady. - Did you hear, Jim? - No, what? - Trav got named this year's MVP. - That's fantastic, Travis. Yeah, and Dustin is heading up Model UN... soon to be Rhodes Scholar and who knows what else. And Jim, teacher of the year. - Well, hey, listen... - I mean, come on. The talent at this table, that is stunning. - And Andy, with your drumming. - It's going okay, Andy? Yeah, it's going really, really well, actually. I'm part of Shaffer's top jazz orchestra... which means it's the best in the country. And I'm a core member... so I'll start playing in competitions. I just... I found out I'm the youngest person in the band. How do you know who wins in a music competition? Isn't it subjective? - No. - Does the studio get you a job? It's not an actual studio. It's the name of the ensemble, but it's a big step forward in my career. I'm so glad you figured it out. It's a nasty business, I am sure. Hey, are you gonna tell them about your game this week? - Living up to your title. - I scored a 93-yard touchdown. School record, school record. - Is that true? That's fantastic. - It's Division Three. It's Carlton football. It's not even Division Two, it's Division Three. - You got any friends, Andy? - No. - Oh, why is that? - I don't know. I never saw the use. Who are you gonna play with otherwise? Lennon and McCartney were buddies. Charlie Parker didn't know anybody till Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head. That's your idea of success? Being the greatest musician of the 20th century is anybody's idea of success. Dying broke and drunk and full of heroin... at the age of is not my idea of success. I'd rather die drunk, broke at and have people talk about me... than live to be rich and sober at and nobody remember who I was. But your friends will remember you, that's the point. None of us were friends with Charlie Parker. That's the point. Travis and Dustin, they have plenty of friends and plenty of purpose. They'll make great school board presidents. You think you're better than us? - Catch on quick. Are you in Model UN? - I got a reply for you. You think Carlton football is a joke? Come play with us. Four words you will never hear from the NFL. - Who wants dessert? - Heard from Lincoln Center? Okay, get out of here. Pick up the new chart by the door on your way out. Rehearsal p.m. sharp tonight. That's how long you have to learn it. Neiman. Stick around a minute. See the tempo marking on there? ""Quarter note equals 330."" That is a double-time swing. - That's what got you in here, right? - Oh, yeah. As fate would have it, I recently stumbled across another kid... in the practice room working on his double-time swing. So I'm gonna give him a shot. - Am I late? - Perfect timing. Come on in, Connolly. - You two know each other, right? - Yeah, Nassau band. What's up, Andrew? I've made Neiman a temporary core, but with this competition coming up... I just wanna make very sure this chart is in the best shape it can be. Yeah, this one right here, right? I gave Connolly the chart this morning. All I wanna do is give you both a crack at it, all right? So, Neiman, go ahead, jump on the kit, take it from the top. Okay. I don't want you to worry about hits now. Just tempo, okay? All set? One, two... Not quite my tempo. Connolly. - I can take it from the top. - Connolly, go ahead. - I can do... - No. We'll go with Connolly now. Hey, do you mind? Okay, man, ready? One and two and... - Perfect, Connolly. - Oh, my God. See, this to me is the beauty of Studio Band. You walk in here an alternate, you could be the new core. - Oh, my God, are you serious? - Thanks. That shit? Fletcher. Thanks, man. Here you go. Don't worry about Fletcher. He's more bark than bite. Hey, look, you... I can play these charts. - Now is not the time, I swear to God. - I can play it, okay? I said not now! If you want the fucking part, earn it. I'm just gonna lay it out there. This is why I don't think we should be together. And I've thought about it a lot, and this is what's gonna happen. I'm gonna keep pursuing what I'm pursuing. Because I'm doing that, it's gonna take up my time. I'm not gonna be able to spend time with you. Even when I do, I'm gonna be thinking about drumming. About jazz, my charts. Because of that, you're gonna start to resent me. You're gonna tell me to ease up on the drumming, spend more time with you. I'm not gonna be able to do that. I'll start to resent you for even asking me to stop. We're just gonna start to hate each other. It's gonna be ugly. And so for those reasons... I'd rather just, you know, break it off clean. Because I wanna be great. And you're not? I wanna be one of the greats. And I would stop you from doing that? Yeah. You know I would stop you from doing that? You know that for a fact? Yes. And I'd barely see you anyway? - Yeah. - I see you, you'd treat me like shit... because I'm some girl who doesn't know what she wants. You have a path, you're going to be great, I'm gonna be forgotten... and you won't be able to give me the time of day... because you have bigger things to pursue. That's exactly my point. What the fuck is wrong with you? You're right. We should not be dating. I'm okay. Thanks. Fuck! Fuck! Fucking piece of shit! Fuck you! Fuck! Fucking piece of shit! Come on! Sorry, we have a new player. Ryan Connolly. I'm sorry. Guys, just put your instruments down for a minute. Just listen for a minute. Six years ago... I came across a kid in a practice room working on his scales. He was early second year and he'd started at Shaffer with a lot of hope. Like all you guys. But the truth was that he barely squeaked in to begin with... and he was really struggling. The faculty were all telling him, ""Maybe this isn't for you."" But they didn't see what I saw. This scared, skinny kid... cursing himself because he couldn't get his scales right. I saw a drive in him. And I put him in Studio Band. And when he graduated... Marsalis made him third trumpet at Lincoln Center. A year later, he was first. That's who you're listening to now. His name was Sean Casey. I found out this morning... that Sean... died yesterday... in a car accident. And I just... I wanted you guys to know he was a beautiful player. I just thought you should know. I'm sorry. Okay. Let's get to work, huh? How about ""Caravan,"" bar 105? Two bars for free. One and two and... It's not quite right, Connolly. I'd like to try Neiman on this. Maybe now's the time for Neiman to earn the part. One and two and... Nope, I guess not. Tanner? One and two and... Motherfucker! Connolly, get your ass back on the kit. We will stay here for as long as it takes until one of you fagots can play in time. One and two and... Looks like that might be all night. Neiman. One and two and... Not my fucking tempo! Sorry, guys. Hate to put you through this. If you need to fucking take a dump or get a coffee... whatever, now might be a good time. We're gonna stay until I find a drummer who can fucking play in time. I apologise to the musicians. Seriously, take 10, 20, a fucking hour. You hear me, cocksuckers? Better start shitting me perfect 400s. Connolly, get your fucking ass back on the kit. Is that really the fastest you can play, you worthless Hymie fuck? No wonder Mommy ran out on you. Get off the fucking kit. And here comes Mr. Gay Pride of the Upper West Side himself. This is not a Bette Midler concert. We will not be serving baked Alaska... so just play faster than you give hand jobs, will you? One, two, one, two. Not even fucking close. Let's go with the Irish Mick Paddy cracker now. You know, you actually do look quite a bit like a leprechaun. I'm gonna start calling you Flannery. Get off! What are you looking for? There's no gold down there. Adjusting the seat? Really? That's been your problem the whole time? The seat height? So now you have it, right? Go. Bullshit! Fuck you! Neiman. Maybe it's time... to finally bring this home. What do you say? Show me. Don't slow down. Pick it up. Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Keep playing! Keep playing! Keep playing! Keep playing! Don't stop. Neiman... you earned the part. Alternates, you wanna clean the blood off my drum set? Okay, we can start now. p.m. call tomorrow in Dunellen. Give yourselves at least two hours to get there this time, all right? Save your travel receipts. Or don't. I don't give a shit. - Do you know where the cabs are? - You gotta call the cabs. - The cab was supposed to be here. - You gotta call. They take forever. How do I get to Hargrove? Hey. Come on. Please, come on. You're still open. You're still open. Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah, hello? Neiman, where are you, man? Call time was 5. I know, I know. I'm almost there. I'm right there. - We're on-stage in 20. - I know. - Fletcher's got Connolly warming up. - God fucking da... Okay. You just tell that little fucking redhead I'll... I'm gonna be there, okay? Fuck. Hey. Hey. Sorry I'm late. Well, glad you could fit us into your busy schedule, darling. I'm sorry I'm late. I'm ready to go. - Connolly's playing the part. - Like fucking hell. What the fuck did you say to me? It's my part. It's my part and I decide who to lend it to. Usually it's somebody that has fucking sticks. I left them in the car. I'll be right back. Five minutes. I'm warming up the band now. - I can use Ryan's sticks. - Neiman, you lost the fucking part. No, I didn't. You can't do this. - Can't? - Yeah. When did you become a fucking expert on what I can do... - ...you fucking weepy-willow shit sack? - I earned that part. You never earned anything. You are a self-righteous prick. The only reason you're a fucking core is because you misplaced a folder. Only reason you're in Studio Band to begin with is because I told you... what I'd be asking for in Nassau. - Am I wrong? - Yeah. - I'm in Studio Band because I'm the... - Back off. Hey, fuck off, Johnny Utah. Turn my pages, bitch. Hey. I can cut you any fucking time I want. - You would've cut me by now. - Try me, you fucking weasel. At 5:30, that's in exactly minutes, my band is on-stage. If your ass is not on that stool with your own sticks in hand... or if you make one fucking mistake... one, I will drum your ass back to Nassau... where you can turn pages until you graduate or fucking drop out. By the time you're done at Shaffer, you'll make Daddy look like a success story. Got it? Or we can let Johnny Utah play the part. - You choose. - That's my part. I'll be on your stage. - Fuck you. - You got minutes... you fucking pathetic, pansy-ass fruit fuck. - Tell Fletcher I'm coming. - What's taking you so long? - We're moving on-stage. - I got locked in my car. I'm coming. Left turn, feet. - Are you driving, man? - No. What the hell was that noise? Okay, why don't you just tell Fletcher that I'm coming, you motherfucker? Hey. Hey, hey. Are you okay? Are you okay? - I gotta get my sticks. - No, stay away from the car. - I've called 911. - Look, I gotta go. - No, no, sir. - A couple more blocks. - Sir, no, you don't have to... - Please get off me. - Hey, guy. - What the fuck happened to you? The Shaffer Conservatory Studio Band. Neiman, what the fuck? Fuck. Neiman... you're done. Gentlemen, ladies, I apologise... on behalf of Shaffer Conservatory. Piece of shit. I'll fucking kill you. - Fuck you. - Get the... - Get the fuck off me. - Get off me. Fuck off. Fuck you. Fuck you! Fuck you, Fletcher! Fuck you! Get off. Fuck. Piece of shit! Fuck you! - When did you start talking to her? - Your father got in contact this week. Does the name Sean Casey mean anything to you? You know of his death? Last month, he hanged himself in his apartment. - What does that have to do with me? - He suffered from anxiety, depression. His mother claims this started during his time as Fletcher's student. Now, the Caseys aren't wealthy, they don't wanna file suit. So, what do they want? To make sure Terence Fletcher is never allowed to do this to another student. Hey, Dad, look at my paradiddle. Yeah, that's my boy. - He didn't do anything. - What is wrong with you? It's over, okay? He's out of your life. Why would you let him get away? Would you characterize his conduct as extreme, Andrew? Did he ever intentionally inflict emotional distress? This would not be a public hearing, you know. Fletcher would never know it was you who spoke up. Why would you do this to me? Do you think that I would let him put my son through hell... and then just walk away scot-free? Don't you know I would never let that happen? That there is nothing in the world more important to me than you? Don't you know that? Andrew? Andrew? Just tell me what to say. Hey. I'd give anything to be there again this fall. I like weddings, provided they're not mine. Marriages are very healthy. Married men live much longer than bachelors. They're trying to outlive their wives so they can be bachelors again. - Haven't you thought of getting married? - I did. The young lady changed her mind at the last moment. I've been deeply indebted to her ever since. And I loaded the pantry up with Gushers. - Saw that. - Okay. All right. Thanks. Right on, man. Andrew. Hey. I don't know if you heard. I'm not at Shaffer anymore. Yeah, I did hear that. Did you quit? Not exactly. Some parents got a kid from Sean Casey's year, I think... to say some things about me. Although why anybody would have anything... other than peaches and cream to say about me is a mystery. Yeah. - That's a good laugh, right? - I'm sorry. - No, listen... I get it. - I'm sorry. I know I made enemies. I'm conducting a little, though. They brought back the JVC Fest this year. They got me opening in a couple of weeks with a pro band. That's great. Yeah. It's all right. Truth is, I don't think people understood... what it was I was doing at Shaffer. I wasn't there to conduct. Any fucking moron can wave his arms and keep people in tempo. I was there to push people beyond what's expected of them. I believe that is... an absolute necessity. Otherwise, we're depriving the world of the next Louis Armstrong. The next Charlie Parker. I told you about how Charlie Parker became Charlie Parker, right? - Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head. - Exactly. Parker's a young kid, pretty good on the sax. Gets up to play at a cutting session, and he fucks it up. And Jones nearly decapitates him for it. And he's laughed off-stage. Cries himself to sleep that night, but the next morning, what does he do? He practices. And he practices and he practices with one goal in mind... never to be laughed at again. And a year later, he goes back to the Reno and he steps up on that stage... and plays the best motherfucking solo the world has ever heard. So imagine if Jones had just said: ""Well, that's okay, Charlie. That was all right. Good job."" And then Charlie thinks to himself, ""Well, shit, I did do a pretty good job."" End of story. No Bird. That, to me, is an absolute tragedy. But that's just what the world wants now. People wonder why jazz is dying. I tell you, man, and every Starbucks ""jazz"" album... just proves my point, really. There are no two words in the English language more harmful... than ""good job."" But is there a line? You know, maybe you go too far and you discourage the next Charlie Parker... - ...from ever becoming Charlie Parker. - No, man, no. Because the next Charlie Parker would never be discouraged. Yeah. The truth is, Andrew... I never really had a Charlie Parker. But I tried. I actually fucking tried. And that's more than most people ever do. And I will never apologise for how I tried. I'll see you later. Yeah. Hey, Andrew. Listen, I have no idea how you're gonna take this... but the band I'm leading for JVC, my drummer is not cutting it. You understand what I'm saying? No. I'm using the Studio Band playlist. You know, ""Caravan,"" ""Whiplash."" I need somebody who really knows those charts. What about Ryan Connolly? All Connolly ever was to me was incentive for you. - Tanner? - Tanner switched to premed. I guess he got discouraged. Hey. Take the weekend. Think about it. - Hello? - Hey, Nicole, it's Andrew. - Hi. - Hey. It's been a while since I talked to you. Look, I... I'm really sorry about everything. I know that's not, you know, enough, but I'm just really sorry. But anyway, I got... I actually have this show this weekend. It's a... Like, a JVC thing. And I didn't know if maybe you'd wanna go... and we, you know, maybe get some, like, pizza afterwards... and, like, complain about our schools again. What is...? You said Jayvees? No, it's JVC. It's like a... It's a jazz thing. Yeah. Oh, okay. Well, I don't know if I can come. I... I'll have to check with my boyfriend. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll check, but I don't know. I don't really think he likes jazz music. Yeah, I mean, it's not for everybody. Okay. Well, I guess maybe I'll see you guys there. - Okay. - Okay. Bye. All right, gang, listen up. Now, for those of you who are new at this... which looks like everybody except Cal, tonight could change your life. The folks out there make a phone call, you could be a Blue Note signee... an EMC client, a Lincoln Center core. On the other hand... if you drop the ball, you might be looking for a new line of work... because the other thing about these cats is they never forget. We all set? All right. Let's have fun. You think I'm fucking stupid? - What? - I know it was you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We're very excited to be here kicking off the JVC Festival this year. I'm Terence Fletcher, these are some of the best musicians in New York... which means they're some of the best musicians in the world. We're gonna do some old standards, but we're gonna start with a new tune... by Tim Simonec called ""Upswingin'."" What the fuck you doing? Come on, man. Yeah, I guess maybe you don't have it. That was a little extra avant-garde there from the rhythm section. Come on, let's go home. What are you doing? Now we're gonna slow it down a little bit. I'm guessing most of you folks have heard... I'll cue you in. ""Caravan."" Three, four. I'm gonna gouge out your motherfucking eyes. - Andrew, what are you doing, man? - I'll cue you."
35,2010,Hurricane Season,American,"This movie is based on the true story of John Ehret High School's 2005–06 State championship team. After Hurricane Katrina, Al Collins (Forest Whitaker), a John Ehret high school basketball coach in Jefferson Parish, across the river from New Orleans in Marrero, Louisiana, assembles a team of players who had previously attended five different schools before the disaster and leads them on the path to winning the state championship.",6.5,tt1172998,"Most of y'all have played for me before, so you know I don't claim to be some basketball guru. My playbook is downright simple. Only five set offensive plays... five. Now believe it or not, we can go all the way with just those five plays. We're gonna practice those plays times. We're gonna practice 'em till they are part of your... your DNA. All you boys need are three things. One, execution. Two, cohesiveness... which is just another fancy word for teamwork. You must learn to act as one unit on both ends of the court. One finger can't pick up a pebble. But one hand... Can move the Earth. ...can move the Earth. Somebody was listening to me last year. That's good. Three, effort. You must bring it to every practice. You must bring it to every moment, to every second of every game. You leave that out there on that hard wood, and win or lose, you will never have to look in the mirror and wonder, ""Did I do enough?"" We could have ourselves a great year, fellas. A great year. But it all starts right here and right now. Let's get to the baseline! - Let's go! - All right, Coach. Run, fellas. Run. All right, Christian. Where you at, Spence? Where you at?

Christian, basketball first this year. - Girls second, Coach, yeah. - You got that, Courtney? Yes, sir. He knows me? Of course he knows you, girl. Yo, come on, I got one. Ball right here. Mismatch. Come on, G, shake him up, man. Come on, shake him up, Gary. - You got it, Gary! I hope you're having fun. Wooo! The Louisiana High School Athletic Association would like to remind all players, your forms must be filled out completely before delivering them to station D... Go on now, Randy. D him up, baby! ""D' him up! - What up, Christian? - It's good, JJ. That's what I'm talking about. Watch how Spence take advantage of the white boy. Offensive foul. Come on, Spence, you hooked me. You're fronting. That was clean. Take it out, white boy. Remember the good old days, Sam? Oh yeah, man. Once you're a Patriot, you're always a Patriot. Right, right. Go on, put me in the game, Coach. You get rid of that broom, I'll get you a ball. - Don't get me started now. - There you go. Ohhh! - Boy's money, Coach. - You think? Poor ass East Bank busters. Coach, I'm gonna get outta here. Our boy Brian is a beast. - How you making out, Collins? - All right, Simmons. You looking to win district again this year? It's a hard thing to repeat. You looking to repeat 500? No. I'm looking to make a run at your team for the district champs this year. What you think? Everybody got a dream. Hey, sweetie. Hey, baby. That's a weak-ass dunk you did over there, boy. You talking about that silly-ass dunk you did down there? I'm talking to your bitch-ass, West Bank bitch. East Bank ass nigga. Get back! Get back. You all right, son? I'm cool. Collins, I'm sorry about that. Just a little bit too much testosterone. That's all it is. Okay? It's all right. Come on. Let's go, guys. Let's go. - What's wrong with you? - Let's go, come on. Attention, this is Principal Durant. The National Hurricane Center has just announced tropical storm Katrina is headed for the Mississippi-Louisiana coast. Governor Blanco has declared a state of emergency and ordered voluntary evacuations... Patriots! Spence, get the guys over here. - Come on. - Coach, you heard what they just said? Lt'll turn or get downgraded, just like it always does. All right, Coach, but what about practice? Listen to the news. Katrina turns, we're on. If she doesn't, you go. The National Weather service is reporting that tropical storm Katrina is moving toward the Florida coast and landfall is also possible in Mississippi... Al. Dayna, I don't think you need to pack. We might not have to leave, but we're gonna be ready just in case. years since Betsy. It'll turn, like always. Daddy, I am so glad you're home. Baby, it's 9:30. You're supposed to be in bed already. You can't take all those toys with you. Even if we have to leave, you can only take your suitcase. So, Coach. Mm-hmm. How'd the team look this year? It's the best team I ever had. We're gonna win this year, Dayna. We're gonna win. I got the whole season planned out. Right here. You got a plan for everything, Coach. It's beautiful, ain't it? When you planning on coming to bed? Just give me a minute, all right? Okay. Don't stay up all night, hear? - Hey! - What's up with you, bitch? Footlocker is open. I got some special ""get out of town"" discounts. - See, I told you. - Air Max Elites, go for like two bills in the store. for you though. - I like these. These are... - Yeah. No, no, I need a 12. - 12. - 13. I'm good with that, Lamont. - I'm good with 13. - White boy. No, I need a 12, Lamont. You know my size. This ain't Amazon, boy. I got inventory issues. Get outta here, Lamont, before I call the police. - Come on. - I ain't playing. Just meet me over there in West Jeff, baby. West Jeff? On the East Bank? - West Jeff. - No, that's enemy territory. - Where your loyalty at, Lamont? Loyalty? Look at my loyalty, baby. Right here. I bet against y'all and I win. Y'all boys couldn't break if you paid the refs. How you gonna take my drink like that too, Lamont? - Give me those shoes. - What's up, Spence. - What's up, Spencer? - What's up? - Spence, what you still doing here? The team needs you healthy, son. You gotta get outta here. We ain't going nowhere. Gonna kick that Katrina ass. What you talking about? Every person is hereby ordered to immediately evacuate... Hey, bro? Y'all think that Katrina gonna hit us? Who cares, man? Let's take a look now at where Hurricane Katrina is at this very moment. Katrina is one day away and getting stronger by the hour. The storm is huge. It's a deadly category five hurricane. It's heading towards New Orleans. Dayna... Dayna, it's coming. Dayna, it's cat five. Come on, get up. The streets are blocked. I can't get to you. Mama, I already told you. I got everything under control. If they order you to evacuate, go to the Superdome. Mom, it ain't gonna get that bad. I promise you. Gary, take care of Kendall, you hear? He gonna be taking care of me, ain't that right little brother? - Yup. - See? We got it, Mom. - I love you guys. - I love you, too. - Hey, Mama says she loves you. - I love her, too. He said he loves you back. Ma! Come on, man. Come on! Floodwaters have consumed much of New Orleans. Tens of thousands of people still stranded... I have no idea what they're doing, but I will tell you this... God is looking down on all this, and if they are not doing everything in their power to save people, they are gonna pay the price. Because every day that we delay, people are dying. We're getting reports and calls that is breaking my heart from people saying, ""I've been in my attic. I can't take it anymore. The water is up to my neck. I don't think I can hold out."" People are dying. They don't have homes. They don't have jobs. The city of New Orleans will never be the same. Excuse my French, everybody in America... Daddy? Hey. I wanna go home. Come on. We're gonna go find your mom. ...biggest goddamn crisis in the history of this country. I want my Mommy. Don't cry. Don't cry, Alana. I'm right here, baby. Please do not push or shove. - You will be taken... - Gary, come on, man. Kendall, hold on. Mom said she'd be here by now. Yo, there's Mom. Kendall, I see Mom. Excuse me! - That's my Mom. Wait, wait! - Kid, we gotta leave. Mom! Excuse me. Mom! - Gary! - Mom, we're right here! Gary! Gary! - Don't you worry, Mom. - Where's Kendall? He's on the bus. Come on. He's okay. - Thank God. - He's on the bus. Where we going? Where they taking us? Don't know, baby. JJ. It's good to see you, son. You all right? Season starts in a week. What time practice tomorrow, Coach? It's... look around yourself, son. We're not gonna... I don't think we're gonna have a season this year. So I guess we gonna practice on the black top till the gym's fixed, right? JJ, I don't... I guess we gonna miss our first game. But we gonna play the rest of 'em, right, Coach? Right, Coach? Right, Coach? You all right, son? Are you all right? Coach, our house is gone. My family, we're all crowded in a FEMA trailer eating rations every day, Coach. What time... is practice tomorrow? Even if it's just you and me... to start, I'll be here. I promise you. Thank you. The city's population, which totaled a little under a half a million before Katrina, now stands at less than half that. New Orleans Department of Water and Power is reporting present capacity, and is projecting full capacity in less than four weeks. Every day residents continue to return, and some signs of rebuilding have begun. Aha, there's the floor. Coach... Al. I didn't get your message. What are you doing? I'm putting my team back together again. How? With what? The budget that I have. That money's gone. We'll make do with what we have, won't we? What about the gym? We can play all the games away until this is fixed. Then we'll do all the practice on the black top. Al, this is not where your energy needs to be focused right now. There's a lot going on. Okay, do whatever you're gonna do, just don't come to me for money. I won't. You just let me coach my team. Okay. - Hey, guys. - Hey, Miss Durant. - Hey, Coach. This is Carl. He played ball over at McDonogh 35. He got game. How you doing, sir? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. - Where everybody else? - Nobody heard from Christian. Willy's at Memphis. Eric's at Lafayette. He said he not coming back. Randy said he gonna quit. He did, huh? Here's what you do... you tell Randy to come on by. I wanna see him. All right? You see Spence? No. It's all right, son. Come on, grab a shovel, help me out. - There's one over here, one over there. - All right. - Okay. - We'll work this out. Come on, Sleepy and Dopey. Shovel up and out. Up, out. Up, out. Spence, where you going, son? Hey, Coach. Mr. Walker. We were gonna give you a call when we got settled. We're gonna have a season. Season? Come on, Coach, y'all don't even have a gym. We need you, son. We've worked really hard for this moment. It's my senior year, Coach. It's got to happen for me now if I'ma ever get a scholarship. You can get a scholarship at Ehret. He's going to Woodlawn, Coach. Number two in the nation. That's a program. Mr. Walker, uh, the gym is getting fixed. The teachers are coming back. We're gonna graduate these seniors. But we don't have a team without your son. We can't stay here, man. Wake up, Coach. They don't care about us. New Orleans is over. This what you wanna teach your son? How to run away when things get tough? That's not right. Not right for who, Coach? You? When did this happen? In-state transfers. - Did they change the rule? - Yeah, any student is eligible to play anywhere statewide immediately. We lost two of your guys this morning. - Why didn't you tell me? - I assumed you knew. No. Christian. - Hey. - Coach. What're you doing over here, man? Came to see how you're doing, how your family's holding up. - You all right? - Yeah. - That's good. We'll get you outta here. I want to see you 3:30. Practice tomorrow, all right? You know, Coach, to be honest, I gotta look at my options. We all got choices, Christian. I'm moving out to California. Why? Don't run away. Don't be afraid, son. Don't take the easy way out, son. Don't. Just believe in yourself. Where's Coach at? How much longer we gotta pick this stuff up? Quit asking me, all right? Just worry about this trash. Carl, you get right there, all right? Looking good, fellas. It's looking real good. - Coach. - Hey, Randy. - How you doing? You all right? - Yes, sir. - Hey, hey, hey. - JJ. - What's up, Coach? - Hey. Whoa, whoa, stand back. You boys are ripe. Ripe? Can't wash our clothes, Coach. There are no laundromats. - Randy got a washing machine. - I got one. - You got a washing machine? - Yup. Why didn't you tell me? All right, you get to wash the uniforms. Ha ha, wash the uniforms. I know you didn't get to play much last year. I didn't get to spend much time with you. That's gonna change this year. You're gonna go down here. Just shoot till you miss. What am I gonna do after I miss, Coach? You're gonna shoot till you make it. Come on. Come on, son. Come on. I want you to show me your shot. Okay? Show me what you got. Haven't had much chance to work on it over the summer, Coach, but... Whoa! What's that? - You forgot how to shoot, son? I haven't forgotten, Coach. Okay, we're gonna go back to fundamentals. Put your left hand behind your back. Put the ball on your fingertips. Oh, not this drill, Coach. We did this a million times last season. Son, you can never get enough of the fundamentals. Coach, you're wasting your time. If white boy could shoot, he would've been shooting. - I got it. - Look at that. It's ridiculous. - It's all right, son. - Keep working, Randy. It's terrible. Ridiculous. I'm gonna have to find a special drill for you. What kinda drill I'ma do by myself? If I remember right, we've gotta work on your footwork. Hey, Coach! Hey. Christian. You all right? Yeah, baby, I'm great, man. - JJ. - Yo, my man. Hey, what's going on? Christian, man. - Carl, man. - All right. - Where everybody at, yo? - They'll be coming. Are you with us, son? Yeah. I'm glad to see you. I need somebody to lead this team. I'ma make you captain. - Serious? - Yeah. Oh, yeah, this is my boy Dave. Dave, that's Coach Al. - What's your last name, son? - Yeah, about that, Coach... he don't really speak too much, but he play that D. - JJ. - Carl, man. I know it's crazy out there, off this court. But this blacktop right here... is your sacred ground. When you're here... you're safe. We're gonna be small, but we're gonna be tough. I just need you to dig deep. Deep. - I know you boys can do it. - Yes, sir, Coach. All right. Let's get to work. Ready. Stay low. Short chop step. This a-way. We're a little shorthanded. Five players. So you'll have to be twice as good to compete. That means you'll have to train twice as hard. Life is hard, but we gotta keep livin' Once upon a time we was chillin' Now we dodgin' fallin' ceilings After the storm passed And I still hear Hungry with hunger, feeling delirious And I wonder if the Congress is hearing this... Excuse me. Can I get one? We will have pride in our playing. Our discipline and cohesiveness will make us competitive. I'm sorry. Would two be all right? I got a team of boys I'm coaching. - Dayna: Al? - Hey, Dayna. So I saw the house yesterday. - How is it? - Needs a little bit of work. Just a little work? Oh, come back and get us. I'm ready to go. - Come on. - I'm gonna come back soon. I'll be back soon. - All right? - Okay. All right. Begging for change, and a hope for the future Soak up the rain And let the spirits start to move you Release the pain And the stress afflicted to you Never dreamt a hurricane would do it to us... Appreciate it. A vision of a third world country on first sight Can't believe my own folks called us refugees Trying to write us off like we ain't worthy to be The rain comes falling... Daddy! Hey. Al, why didn't you tell me? I tried to. Didn't know how. My baby's room. Oh, my grandmother's vanity. Ohh. Look at this. Alana, you're not supposed to be in here. Al, just let her see it. - Put this on. - We can't save nothing. Don't touch that. It's got mold on it. All right? I used to rock you to sleep in that chair when you were a baby. There's nothing here anymore. Fix the house. FEMA'll help us put it back together again. - I'm ready to go. - Where? Where? - Arkansas? - They speak English. It's not a foreign country. But my players are here, Dayna. Al, please, forget about your players for once. Your family needs you, Al! Our family's gonna make it work right here. We're the glue that holds this place together. If people like us leave, then what? Our daughter was raised here. Our grandparents, they died here. If we don't take a stand, who will? - I can't. I can't. - Yes, you can. You can. I got five boys depending on me. I gave 'em my word. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality said today that initial water samples from sites... Where you at, Coach? Al. How are you and your family making out? House is damaged. We're working on it. How about you? You all right? No. House is gone. And my job. Orleans Parish threw me and my tenure out on the street like we're debris. You know, I could use a little help over at the school. I bet you can. You want me to help you carry your trash now? It's not that much money, but... You just want my players, Collins. I'm asking about you. I'm not asking about your players. I hope things get better for you. Man, look at this, bro. It all starts here, yo. Oh, man. We got our house back, y'all These are called ""MREs..."" ""Meals ready to eat."" This one here is... mashed potatoes. With gravy? It doesn't say anything about gravy. How you gonna eat mashed potatoes with no gravy? You guys put that stuff down, get ready for practice. - I got gum up in mine, yo. - I got gum too. - All right, fellas, let's go. - Here we come, Coach. - Stretch it out. - Just wanna get my gum. Don't bounce it. Pass it, keep it in the air. Gotta work on gettin' em in the lane. - They need to spread themselves... - Coach. - I gotta go. - You'll get your chance in a second. - No, I gotta go. - Keep it spread out! - I gotta go. - Go, go, go, son. Ooh. There you go. That's nice. That's nice, the way you spaced it out! That's what I'm talking about. That was good. - Look at him. What's wrong, son? I gotta go to the bathroom. Go ahead. Go ahead. - Me, too. - You all right? I gotta go too, Coach. All right. Cool. Let's check on my boys. Government's supposed to be helping! Congress has approved additional financial assistance, so what we want you to know is FEMA's making up for lost time. That's why we're coming to you in the cities and churches and libraries of this battered city. And in Lafayette, Houston, Chicago, Dallas, where the refugees have ended up. Who you calling a refugee? Did you just say what I think you said? Let's give her a chance to speak, please. FEMA representative: I'd like to ask you if you have any questions I could answer right now. Coach Collins, right? I'm Brian Randolph. I know who you are. Power forward, Kennedy High. All District, Kennedy High, bro. You've seen me play? I've seen you fight. Oh. Okay, yeah. Well, your boy was out there sweating me, so... No. You were out of line. So I guess you didn't come for church. - No, bro. - Hey. It's not bro. It's Coach. My coach from summer ball sent me up here. Coach Simmons? Brian Simmons? Lot of teams want me to come play for them, now, Coach. I'm coming to you first. But if you don't want me, tomorrow I'm going to go... You were out of line that day. And I can't have that on my team, do you understand? But we could use you, Brian. No doubt. I rode plenty, but I ain't never really drove a bus before. Then why'd you volunteer, Sam? I drive a pick-up truck. One of them duals with those big-ass tires in the back. You know, same thing. Same exact thing, it's just that... This is the church's bus. We can't hurt the church's bus. Oh, I see it's a church bus. Got God on the side of that bus and everything. You know the good thing about that is, we don't got to work on no gas, 'cause this bus is filled with the holy spirit. Oh, we're about to be pewn! You know what pewn is, right? No. Pewn! You mean gone? I'm gone. Ha, ha! Get on board, everybody! Welcome to the NASCAR Bus series. Get off my ass! Get around! Don't sit behind me. Go by! Come on by. Come on by. You know what, Coach? I take that back. This ain't nothing like my pick-up truck. Nothing at all. Sam? That thing under your right foot is called an accelerator. You know what I call it? A bunion. A big-ass bunion. Sam? Sam, we're gonna be late. We're in good shape, Coach. This here bus, like an old woman. Ever make love to an old woman, Coach? No, Sam. No. Yeah, well, I have. I make love to her, spread her legs up and turn her around and start hearing all those creaks and cracks. You gotta put that leg down. You can't hold that leg up that long. This bus is an old woman. I put this bus in the wrong position, what will happen? I don't know, Sam. Something's going to break! Something's going to break. Fellas? Fellas, you've got minutes to get ready. Randy, why don't you get the uniforms out, all right? Coach, there was a slight little problem with the rinse cycle. One, two, three! Patriots! Damn you, white boy. What, did you not measure your bleach? JJ, I messed up. We look like fools, man. What the... Woo! Sexy! Hey, don't worry about that. Just play. Covington High welcomes the John Ehret patriots from the West Bank of New Orleans. The first game of the season since the hurricane. And the Patriots win the tip. Stick with. Number 21, David Lewis brings the ball... Crowd chanting: Defense! Defense! Hey! Whoa! Brian! Pass the ball! Hey, come on, Brian. Woo! Come on, Brian. First score by number 23, Brian Randolph! Start running offense! Come on! Hey, look up! Ball! Ball, ball, ball! Hey! Come on! Take the shot. White boy can't shoot! It's all right. It's all right. Keep your head up. Let's play. Get back! Get back! Where's the D? Let's go. Let's pass. Yes! Woo! Tech. Technical foul on red 23. You gonna call a tech on me, bro? Brian! - Technical foul on red 23. - Get over here. Two shots. Why don't you let him play, ref? Hey, Brian! Brian. I didn't even do nothing, man! This is bullshit! You don't... Get on the bench. What? You heard me. I told you to sit your ass down! You sit your ass on the bench. Foul on number 23, Brian Randolph. First technical, third person. I'm Carl, Coach. Carl, I want you to go in. First one's good. You like the view from here? You want a water? Or a Gatorade? 'Cause I want you to be comfortable. Need you to get used to sitting here, because if you don't listen to what I have to say, and you don't do what I tell you to do, this is the view that you're going to have all year long. Let's go, Chris! Stolen by JJ. And the final score, John Ehret Patriots, 67, John Ehret Patriots, 67, Covington Lions, 56. It's a long year, coach. Elliot Randolph. Brian's father. What can I do for you, Mr. Randolph? I know a thing or two about the game, being involved with a great player. You want to go to district? Give my boy the ball. I don't need coaching help. He can carry this team on his back. Let's make a deal. I'll do the coaching, you watch from the stands. Coach? Last man in? Yeah, Coach. Yeah. Nope. No, let's go again. - But we won! - Go. Come on, man! Let's go! You're wasted your seconds. Your mouths get you into trouble on the court! Dog it, and you'll be running for an hour. Pick. Pick coming. That's the only thing I want to hear. East side! West side! East coast! West coast! You're a team. You're supposed to be helping each other. You're supposed to be watching each other's back! Let's go! Randy? Yes, sir, Coach? What you shooting these days? Three for 10, Coach. Three for 10? Hell, I can hit three for 10. I need you to hit in a row. in a row? Coach, I'm not Kobe Bryant, okay? Well, you better pretend you are Kobe. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. Son, come on up here. Somebody give me the ball. Come on up here, Randy. What? Come on. Top of the key. Come on. Randy makes this shot, this three right here, y'all don't have to run no more. Here you go. Coach, this doesn't make any sense. Why are you doing this to me? You can do this. Take the shot. Coach, let me shoot it, man. - I'm tired as hell, too, Coach. - Let me shoot it! He can't make that shot. You boys need to support your teammate. What, do you want to distract him? Do you want him to make the shot? Let me shoot it. Let me shoot it, Coach. He can't make that. Let me shoot it. Nice shot. Come here, baby. I knew he could do it, Coach! Practice over. I might get some respect. Hey, bro, stop writing on the lockers, man. This ain't the east. We respect our house, here. Hey, hey. My bad, bro. You got it, Captain. Oh, shoot, before I forget. I think I got a little something that might belong to you. Huh? Give you girlfriend her number back. I ain't gonna call her. I promise. I ain't gonna do it. I ain't gonna do it, bro. She fine, though. I ain't that type of brother. You should have gave the number to me. I would've called her. Your boy's a little soft, coach. I'm telling you. You're in no position to evaluate anyone, 'cause you couldn't guard a statue. Aw. Yeah, I'm gonna get with the D, you know. Eventually. You're a ball hog, Brian. - A ball hog? - Yeah. But let me tell you like this. You give me the rock 70 of the time, you're going to win. Easy. No question. That may be. Yeah. But I'm gonna run the offense through Christian. Christian? Yeah. How about showing me some love, huh, Coach? I'm the only D-1 player you've got on this whole team, and you're going to run the offense through Christian? Just 'cause you're a good player, son, doesn't mean you get to do whatever you want to do. You sure about that, coach? Oh, I'm positive. The recent upsurge in violence in post-Katrina New Orleans has been attributed to the closing of over schools. One surviving school, John Ehret, whose basketball team has been cobbled together with players from all over New Orleans eked out a victory in their first game of the season. This is surprising, after losing their star player, Spencer Walker, to top-ranked Woodlawn early... How you making out, Coach? All right. I wanted to... to thank you for sending Brian my way. I tried to call you, but the number you gave me was disconnected. Yeah, well, you know how it is. I saw your opener. I'm still surprised at that with only six players. Yeah, I don't know, Coach. If they'd have played some real defense, probably beat us. Coach, with your personnel, just be glad you got any wins. You're playing Bourgeois next, right? Yeah. Thank you. Hell. I beat 'em like they stole something from me. All you gotta do is utilize your speed on them, and they... You know, I could still use some help around here. And like I said, I'll do what I can to get you paid. I don't give a damn about the money. So then I'll see you tomorrow. How about 3:00? Sure. Whoa! Take it. What's that? David, were you calling for a pick? Were you asking for help? Go on. Go on, go sit down. Go sit down. Don't come back on this court until you're ready to play. Hey, come on, now, Coach. Don't you think you're being a little bit hard on him? I mean, he is trying. I need effort on this court. You ready to play? I'm ready, Coach. All right, get in, JJ. Carl, you get over there on Brian. JJ, you get over there with Christian. Let's do it. Fellas, I need you to talk to each other. All right, JJ? Let's do it. - Boy? - Coach! David! Coach, my initial examination indicates that David is extremely malnourished. What's going... We lost our Mama in Katrina, and it's been hard. And now it's just the two of us. David ain't opened his mouth since then. I'm sorry. Could you go check on the rest of the boys? Nurse: Sure thing, coach. Go with him. David, it's going to be okay. Drink some more water. So, I found a job. Patient rep down at Memorial. I start on Monday. Great. That's great. Al, after school, Alana's gonna be your responsibility. What are you talking about, Dayna? You know I got practice. They won't let me keep her at the hospital, Al. Doesn't Ellis have an after-school program? Not since Katrina. How am I supposed to coach and baby-sit at the same time? You're not a babysitter! You're a father. Right. Maybe not. But those boys have been through so much already... And so have we, Coach. Simmons: So look here, so I got two players I think you should take a look at. First one's name is Nick Washington. All District, Hardin High. Yeah, he just came back. I'm gonna go check him out at Hardin Park after practice. I don't know. Another East Bank kid? I'm gonna have to go with you on that. You don't trust me scouting on my own? I didn't say that. You didn't have to. Ah! That's what's up, Nick! Yeah, baby! Daddy, in my opinion, I think you should sign him up. Gotta agree with you on that. Simmons: The other player you should take a look at is a point guard by the name of Gary Davis. You should talk to him. See what you think. Coach, uh... you know I don't play ball or nothing like that no more. Who said anything about playing ball, son? Coach Simmons. I mean, he spoke to me... I don't even think that you could make the team, son. Huh? Coach, if I wanted to make your team, I could make your team, Coach. That's not a problem. I don't know. I've seen you play. You got good D. Yeah. But you're very one-dimensional, son. One-dimensional? Yeah. Coach, I'm the fastest player in the whole of the East Parish. You know what? You know what? It's good to see you so confident. Anyway, doesn't matter. Have a nice day, son. Announcer: And here come the Patriots. Crowd chanting: Defense! Defense! And that's another score for the newest member of the Patriots, Gary Davis. Time, time! Good time. Good time out. 20-second time out by the Patriots. Gary Davis has been a real spark plug on both ends of the floor. Good effort. Good effort. - Good play, Gary. - Appreciate it, Coach. All right, here we go, fellas. We got seconds left, we're gonna run pairs. Gary, I want you to take the inbound from Brian. Just drive really hard down towards the middle. - Okay? - Got it. Brian, give me a hard pick for Christian. Christian, it's your ball. You take the shot. All right, fellas. That's the play. - Let's run it. I'm looking at the score. We're all right. We got this in the bag. What you looking at? How much you wanna bet they don't score? Aren't you in the wrong rooting section? This is what I'm rooting for, little mama. Mind your business. Who is that? Get over here, all y'all. Woo! C'mon, baby! Let's do it! Let's go, Brian! Let's run the offense. Come on! Crowd: Defense! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Brian, take it to the hoop, son. Hey, Brian. Pass the ball. Oh! Charge against number 23. Hahnville? How'd we lose to Hahnville, brothers? How did we lose, man? Tell Captain pork-ass to give me the ball. Hey, man, you need to watch you mouth. Whoa, whoa. What's going on here? Hey! Sit down. What do I need to say to you all to get you to turn this thing around? What you need to do is stop giving your ball to your stupid-ass pet and give me the ball, Coach. That's what you need to do. - You want the ball? - Hell, yeah, I want the ball. - You want the ball? - Hell, yeah. Let me give you the ball. Take the ball! Get out of my gym! You get out. You take your stuff out that locker, you get your bag, you get your bling-bling, you take you earrings. Get on out! You want to play by yourself? Go be by yourself. Get out. You's a bitch. Al. Come on. Nobody move. You hear me? - Coach? - Yeah? We can't afford to kick Brian off this team. You heard what he said. You've dealt with difficult players before. Hell, I know you have. The boy ain't got nowhere to go. I got to think about these other kids. There's other boys in there. Everybody's got problems. Phew, boy. You're about as bad as Brian. All right, what's that supposed to mean? You hear that? You're hot-headed, hard-headed, stubborn, and you don't wanna listen, just like him. You need to stop making excuses for that boy. Go. Crush him. What's wrong? Ruin him. You can do that. Go on, take the one good thing in his life away from him. Go ahead and take that from him. But you came to me and told me that you want to coach your team. Not somebody else's. Yep. Well, guess what? You got somebody else's team. You got New Orleans' team. Whoa. You got me, uptown, downtown, East Bank and West Bank all in here. I get what you're doing, Al. Bigger than the game. I got that. I'm just asking you to bend a little, that's all. Just... just listen a little. Lil' ticket? Lil' ticket. Come on. Bring it here. Come here. Look here. I've talked to Coach, and the problem is, he don't know your greatness like I do. So all you gotta do is show your skills to the Coach and the rest of these other players. Full court. Yeah, Brian. Consider yourself unleashed. Hoo! Boy, you know you a beast when you unleashed. Christian, Christian. Come on, you stop him. All right? It's on now, boy. Come on, boy. Check it up. Hold on, Coach. I don't know if this is too fair. It looks like Lil' Ticket got, what, two, three, four pounds on Christian. You right. You right. David, come on in. Come on here. Let's make this fair. What, you're talking about, like, two on one, now? What, you scared, Brian? Please. I'm gonna dunk on your ass so hard, boy, it's gonna make you talk. I'm sure you will. Woo! I'm sure you will. Full court. Gary, you're in. Nick, you're in. Carl, come on in as well. Go ahead, son. You can do it. You can play all of them. You don't need a team. Go on, Lil' Ticket. This is easy work for you. Come on. Put the ball in the hole. Where your mouth at now, Lil' Ticket? Let's go, Lil' Ticket. Full court. Got something to say? What's up, boy? Huh? C'mon, boy! Defend you man! Let's go. Aw, come on, man. Put the ball in the hoop. Put the ball in the hoop. There it is. What's up, punk? Defense, Lil' Ticket! Oh! That's two-zip. You're making me look bad. Come on and take the ball out, son. You're by yourself, now. This is easy work for you. Talk to me. I got it, man. What did you say? I didn't hear you. I said, I got it. Run! Your ass better run! No more! Brian? You all right, son? Damn baseheads. Trying to steal the copper pipes and sell them for scrap. What are you doing out here? Came by to see if I could sit with you for a while. Come on. Thank you. Came to see how you're holding up after today. You all right? I'm straight. Okay, Coach, look, I'm sorry, okay? I know I shouldn't have opened my mouth like that, but I'm frustrated, Coach. For real, I'm... this is... We've got a little bit of a season left. Maybe I'm going to be making a few adjustments to the personnel. But you've got to remember one thing, you got to fit into the team. The team is not going to fit into you. Only a fool doesn't change, Brian. I am at a total loss. What is it that you boys need me to say to you? You're 9-11. One more loss, and you don't make it to the playoffs. You want to play? Randy. You want to play? Son, don't you feel you deserve to play? Ain't nothing else for me to say to you. You've got to make the decision to be a team. So before you go out onto that court, you gotta work this out amongst yourselves. Tell me what you're gonna do. All right, y'all. How are we gonna do this? Maybe each player should just say what he needs to do better. Then we could say what the other players need to do, too, right? Ah, man, right now we're trying to focus as a team. A team? What kinds of captain is you anyway, bro? You ain't passed the ball to me but about three times this whole season. That's because you never pass the ball back, Brian. You ain't nothing but a selfish bastard, man, and I don't like playing with you. You know what, Chris? You damn right. You is a selfish little bastard. Is that right? What are you mouthing off for, man? It's our team, first. You all know that, bro. - We don't belong? - Take your hands off me. We don't belong here, bro? - Y'all don't want us here? - No. Bye. You don't want us here? Speak up. Bye. You don't want us here, bro? Cool. Yo, Christian, you got to do something. Let's roll, bro. Let's roll. So that's how it is, huh? Cool. - I'm out. - Wait, wait, B-man. - Don't walk out on your team, man. - What team? Hey, Gary, just let him go. What kind of captain are you, Christian? Huh? Yo, B. Yo, B, stop, man. - What, man? - Just for a second, all right? When I moved back to Houston, of them jumped on me and my little brother. Damn near killed us both. Do you think they care about what side of the river I came from? Let's go back in here. Let's handle this like men. Come on, B. This ain't gonna work, bro. 'Cause of him right there. Wow, look at the man in the mirror. You know what? I swear to God, if this clown says one more thing to me... Squash all that! Look, B, man, I know we can work this out. You don't know nothing. You ain't been on this team but about a minute, bro. What? You heard what I said. I've been here long enough to hear it all about you. Brian don't play D. Brian the ball hog. Brian don't pass the ball. Brian don't care about anything. - Even winning. - That's some bullshit. - Yeah? - That's some bullshit! I don't gotta answer to nobody in this room. Nobody! I don't play for none of y'all. Stupid. You're right. He don't play for us. Nope. So who do you play for, then, B? Who you play for, B? Huh? Oh, what, you crying, now? Get your ass out my face. Who you balling for, huh? Get out of my face, little man. Who you playing for, huh? Oh, what, you can't speak now? Man, you better tell me something. - Who you playing for? - My brother. My brother. Go on. My big brother Ray. The boy was the best ever. Do it all over the court, you know. All State. Second team All American. Boy was going to the next level, and the next. Mm-hmm. And then, uh... Some old stupid-ass drunk fool killed him. He was riding his motorcycle, you know? Killed my brother. My daddy, uh... He wanted to jump in the casket with him. Yeah, that day was crazy, that... That was a hard day for us. Um... That boy. You don't know what it's like. Y'all don't know what it's like to try to fill them big ass shoes, boy. I know you don't. 4:30 in the morning. Shooting jumpers till you can't feel your hands. You did that? Hmm? 5:30 running sprints till your feet bleed? That's my daddy. That's my daddy. And I gotta make him proud. And I'm going to make him... You know what? I don't... Y'all gotta play for your own reasons. I gotta play for... I gotta play for my brother. Hey, man, I'm sorry about your brother. Yeah, we down with you, bro. We down with you, B. Real tall. Me too, dawg. We're your teammates. We're your brothers now. Brian: You know, Coach Al said only a fool don't change. So, I guess... if y'all down with me, for real, for real... I'm down with you. We got you, dawg. We got you, dawg. Come on, man, put it up. Put it up, put it up. Brothers on three. Let's go.

Feel like throwin' it up, throwin' it up I feel like throwin' it up, throwin' it up Al Collins racks up another win this time at the expense of East St. John. Sam: You ever ask yourself, man, why don't Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder ever record together? Seems logical, right? Probably because of safety concerns, you know. They'd be both onstage moving their heads. They might bump heads or something, right? Knock each other out. Look to help, fellas, look to help. Announcer: 42-30... That's five wins in a row for the Patriots. Stevie Wonder got that song ""Isn't She Lovely?"" Are you asking me, Stevie, or are you telling me? I guess he's trying to find out if she's lovely 'cause he can't see her. I feel like throwin' it up Man, look at our cheerleaders, bro. They're like Heinz ketchup. Just terrible, sloppy. Look at them. Look at the way them cheerlead. That's bad over there, bro. Damn! Mm-mm-mm. And in high-school news, we've got a Cinderella story that is capturing the city's imagination. The John Ehret Patriots have made the state playoffs after their improbable eight-game winning streak. Their perseverance against the odds has given the flood-ravaged city of New Orleans reason to believe. Wait, wait, wait. I brought something. It's just shoes. - You got a size 12? - Here, just for you. Thank you. We're going all the way to the championship, baby! What are the things necessary for us to win? Brings the ball in to Randolph... - Execution. - All: Execution. - It's good! - Buzzer sounds - My effort. - My effort. - My will. - My will. - My thoughts. - My thoughts. - It will be... - It will be... - because of me. - Because of me. Come on in, fellas. On three... one, two, three! Patriots! Unbelievable! Here we are at the state semi-finals, and the underdog Patriots are up by six! Go for three! Another missed opportunity by the Patriots. ...supposed to be coming over. That's the game? That's the game right there. Turn it up. Get up and guard him! Chief sails. Stops. Pops. Hops! Another three for the Chiefs. Oh, my, how the momentum has changed! The Chiefs are on a 12-3 run. Get the ball thrown to Randolph... Take it down, baby! Shoot the ball. Brian, what are you doing? You had the shot right at the key! Passing the ball off, that's soft! Hey, Brian! Good play. It's all right, son. Stay in the game. Stay in the game. The Chiefs have come back... Oh, come on, D! Play defense! Keep your head on the game! Keep your head on the game. Come on, boys! Patriots up by two. - Time out! Time out! - Whistle blows Time out! 30-second time out! Come on, come on, fellas. Good effort, good work. All right, here we go. We want to go straight. No switching, no switching. No fouls, no threes. No fouls under any circumstance, all right? Either we get this down or we go into overtime. All right? Patriots on three. Right? Here we go. - One, two, three! - All: Patriots! Here we go. They're putting in Number 21. They did this in Mandeville. He's only got one play, a backdoor screen, then lob the ball in the air for an alley-oop. The kid's a jumper. Go, Chiefs! Go, Chiefs! - Time out, ref! - Time out. Listen up. They just subbed in Number 21, the big guy. They like getting that backdoor lob. Okay, so we got to go fake man to a match-up zone so they can't throw it over the top of us. Here we go, fellas. One, two, three! Defense! - Let's go! Ball's come down to the final possession. Chiefs have the ball, side out, trailing by two. Come on! Come on, baby! Come on, baby! Come on! Here we go. Guard him! Unbelievable! Coach Collins and the Patriots have made it to the state-championship game! Pay up, baby. We're going to the championship! That's what I'm talking about! Let's tell the whole goddamn world about this! Hey! Yeah! Yeah. What's up, fellas? Final four. Final two. What's happening? - How you doing? - Congratulations. Congratulations. Doing good. All right? It's quite a turnaround, y'all playing Woodlawn in the finals. Yeah, we... We're finally playing like a team. What about me and you, son? I thought we was a team. - Daddy, you know we still... - I thought we decided this was going to be your all-star, all-state year. Daddy, we're winning. Your coach is winning, getting a lot of ink for himself. You are losing. If your brother was here, we'd own this state and everything in it. Go on and get, boy. Your team is waiting for you. Good luck. You're on your own. Allen, what you doing here? I canceled practice. You trying to work me, Allen? What about your team, Coach? You're my team. Don't you know that? Come here. Mr. Randolph. Mr. Randolph. I just came here to ask you to come to the game. You know... I know about your son Ray. I'm really sorry for your loss. I coached against him in the AAU. He was on the Louisiana Select team. He went up against mine. He got 40. He dropped in the semis. 42. 23. Six blocks. Brian's got that in him, too. I want to help him be all right, but there's only so much I can do. 'Cause what the boy needs is you. Get out of here. All right. We'll get Nick with Courtney Wallace. Brian with Spitz. Greg... ...in the finals against John Ehret? I think our record speaks for itself. I'm blessed with the greatest player in the nation. Of course, you're referring to Spencer Walker, who transferred to number-one ranked Woodlawn from Ehret earlier this year after Hurricane Katrina. Well, look, I respect the heck out of Ehret and what they've overcome, but we're not going to take it easy on them. We are a dominating team. We will dominate this game. I respectfully say that the fairy tale is over. Thank you, Coach Brown. Good luck. Thank you. Welcome to the Cajun Dome and the Louisiana High School Basketball State Championship! Hey, we're sitting here right now with Chris Paul from the New Orleans Hornets, and of course, Caron Butler with the Washington Wizards. Chris, I got to ask you, of course being from a New Orleans team, you've got to be here tonight supporting the other New Orleans team on the court tonight, the John Ehret Patriots. Yeah, you know, we had an off-day, so I decided to come out here and see them play. You know, being here in New Orleans, I wanted to come out, try to show them some support, so hopefully John Ehret can come out with the win. This is your moment, fellas. This is your time. Let's bring it in. Captain? Christian: The Lord is my shepherd... I shall not want. He maketh me lie down in green pastures. And now, with a record of and 11, from Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, the John Ehret Patriots! Son. Son. Hey. Uh, I don't like watching basketball on TV. You can't see what's going on on the inside, you know. Yeah. You got to get up close if you want to see what's going on inside. Yeah. I'm... glad you came. Yeah. It's not what I know. It ain't how I was taught to play the game, but... you're here, you know? Well, uh... All I... All I ever wanted you to be was... the best you, son. Not anybody else. I wouldn't have it any other way. All right? Thank you, Daddy. Thank you, sir. Now get out there and win us the championship. - All right? - Yes, sir! - All right. - Yeah. chuckles The head coach of the Patriots, Al Collins! John Ehret fans must be really proud of their team for making it this far. Oh! Here comes Daddy. Let's show him our shirts, okay? Coach! Coach! Coach! With a record of and 0... ...the number-one team in Louisiana, the Woodlawn Panthers! Just keep your focus, guys. Just basketball. The head coach of the Panthers, Preston Brown! Rawr! Rawr! Rawr! Patriots! Patriots! Gentlemen, gentlemen, we're going to start the game out in a two-three zone. All right, fellas, let's come out hard in the first five minutes. Nick, Brian, Christian, two-three zone! Now, we are and 0. We're going to play smart, we're going to play hard... they cannot hang with it. Let's win this! - Patriots on three. - On three. - One, two, three. - All: Patriots! Panthers! Whoo! All right! Go, Patriots! Let's go. Patriots about to lose. All day, you already know. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's showtime! Panthers score! Man, told you so. What, you never seen anybody lob a ball before? Wake up! Let's go! Stolen by the Panthers, down court to dunk it. Slams it! Ooh. The Patriots have yet to put up any points on the scoreboard. Let's go, let's go. We need to score now. Let's go, let's go. Settle down, fellas! Settle down! To Verdin. And it's... air ball! Ref, time! Time! You know, the Patriots just seem out of sync tonight. Randy Verdin is having a tough time from three-point lane. Guys, guys, guys! Fellas, you got to settle down! All right, don't let your heads get caught up in the lights. Just relax. Play your game. Gary, I want you in for Christian. I want you to settle down a little bit. - Come on! - Let's go, y'all. - Come on, baby. - One, two, three. Defense! - Okay, Coach. - I need you to do this, all right? Just give yourself a minute, Christian. Gary Davis with the ball. Go, go! Defense! Randolph. Rejected! Ohh! - He's out. - Huh? Give us some room, son - You all right, son? - I'm all right. Ladies and gentlemen, he appears to be okay. How about a hand for Number 3, Gary Davis? Well, that'll do it for the first half. Panthers go to the locker room with a 19-point lead. We're about to lose this game, fellas. We're beating ourselves in the first half. You're not boxing out, you're not hitting the boards... they're totally dominating you! You're running scared. What's going on? Hey, Coach? Could you cut the lights off for me? What does this remind y'all of? Katrina. You were exiled by a hurricane, fellas. You lost your homes, people that you love. You were even called refugees in your own country! You're not refugees. You're Americans. Patriots even. And a whole lot of folks thought that you would never succeed. But that's all right. That's okay. Because no matter what happens tonight, you've already won. Because you refuse to give up on yourselves. You refuse to give up on your teammates. And you refuse to give up on New Orleans. Who in this locker room is going to give up tonight? You've already faced the storm. You've looked at that monster, you've looked at her in the eye, and you survived it. 'Cause you're here! You are here! You already won! I just need you to give me minutes. You give yourself... minutes of your best. And win or lose, you will always have this moment. You will always have each other. And you will always have yourself. Who wants to play some basketball? I do, Coach. Who wants to play some basketball? I do, Coach! Who wants to play some basketball? I do, Coach! Who's going to play some basketball? I am, Coach! Well, let's play! Patriots on three! - One, two, three! - Patriots! Come on! Go, son! Go, Brian! Damn it. Slam dunk! Walker passes down the court... Well, Coach Al Collins must have told them that the house is on fire 'cause that's how they're playing now. The Patriots are back in this game. Way to play, fellas. Way to play. This is what we're after. You keep this up, we'll get back in this game. I mean, what is going on? Did you just leave it all in the locker room? You're going to piss away a huge lead in a blink. All right, let's spread it out a little bit. We try to knock out shots from the outside, get those big guys to come out and guard us. These boys can play the game. You know what? Why don't you step up? Why don't you beat them, all stars? Let's do a box to Randy. Coach, I haven't been really hitting them. Just shoot till you miss, son. Shoot till you miss. Randy, you can do this. Get in here. Let's make this a ball game. - Wake up. - One, two, three. Brothers! Come on! Come on! Patriots move the ball around. Randy Verdin to the open three! It's good! Yes. The Patriots have pulled within nine! All right! Let's do it again! Come on, Patriots! Pass to Verdin for three. He nails it! Go, get back, get back! D-up! Johnson dunks it to Walker. Oh, he's fouled. That's his fourth, Coach. We need to take him out now. - David. - Yes, sir. - Why don't you get in for Brian? - Okay, Coach. It's probably because you're tired. Just give yourself a moment. to 50, with 4:45 left in the game. No! No, no, no! Christian! 33! 33! - I can't! - Good call! You're the captain. Go deep! Go deep! David cutting through the paint. Two points to the Patriots! Gary Davis scores. The Patriots have forced the Panthers out of their zone. The Patriots have their first lead of the game! Get back! Ooh! We're all tied up! Brian, I need you to go back in, son. You're in! Woodlawn with the ball and a chance to break the tie. There's greatness inside of you, son. But you got to believe in it. You're not out here by yourself. You got your whole team out here! This is your time. This is your moment. All right, Brian! Stay on your feet! Brian, run! Nick, Nick, Nick! It looks like the Panthers put the game in the hands of their star, Spencer Walker. The Panthers spread out and isolate him against Randolph. Ohh! Blue was out of bounds! White ball! Patriots' ball! That's a good play, Coach. That's a good play. Time out. All right, guys. We're exactly where we want to be. We got the ball and a chance to win the state championship. So, everybody, just relax. Just relax. This is what we're going to do. Sit down! Sit down. Look, look. All right, fellas, we got eight seconds. That's all we got to do... we got eight seconds... hold these boys down, slow them down. Don't let them get that ball up the court fast. Then we're going to go into four minutes overtime, then we're going to kick their ass. We're going to run a four-man stack. We are not going to let this ball get behind us. Brian, you're the last man on the stack. I want you to come around the top, as fast as your legs will carry you. They're probably going to double-team you, so look to Christian coming up the middle and Nick coming up the side. You're going to follow Randolph. They're probably going to try to get him on the baseball pass. Don't let that boy get behind you. - It's time to move earth, fellas. - Let's go. - Let's go, y'all. - Let's go, come on. - Let's go, y'all. - Come on, now. Patriots on three, y'all. - One, two, three. - All: Patriots! Hey, go, go. Crowd chanting: Patriots! Patriots! Go, go, go! Get back, get back! Patriots! All right! All right! The winners and the Louisiana State Champions... the John Ehret Patriots! Come on. What you laughing for, dawg? Why are you laughing? I bet with the Patriots. Good game, son. I'm so proud of you! We did it! Look at that! Whoo! I said I feel like throwin' it up Throwin' it up, throwin' it up I said I feel like throwin' it up Throwin' it up, throwin' it up I said I feel like throwin' it up Coach, Coach, Coach, Coach. Come on, man, come on. This is for y'all. Go, Patriots! - One, two, three. - All: Patriots! Feel like throwin' it up... ...the State Farm Class 5A Championship trophy to the John Ehret Patriots. Head Coach Allen Collins! Coach Collins, I know y'all had to regroup four or five times after Katrina. And for a public school from New Orleans to win a state championship in a year like they've had in New Orleans, what does it mean for that community? I told the fellas before the game I didn't know why God had selected them, but we knew our guys would compete like hell. And if you could get a bunch of people with their backs against the wall to fight like hell, you can do some pretty special stuff. What it feel like? Receive the rewards and respect That all your hard work earned What it feel like? When the coach say, ""Get in the game"" And you finally do get a chance What it feel like?

36,2001,Joy Ride,American,"University students Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker) and Venna Wilcox (Leelee Sobieski), Lewis's childhood friend and crush, prepare to go home for the summer holiday. Lewis, a University of California student, offers to come by Venna's campus (she attends University of Colorado) to drive her home instead of both of them flying back; Venna happily agrees. After refunding his plane ticket to buy a 1971 Chrysler Newport, Lewis calls his parents to announce the change of plan and learns that his older brother Fuller (Steve Zahn), the family's black sheep, has been arrested once again. Lewis drives to Salt Lake City and bails out Fuller, who then tags along for the trip.
At a gas station, Fuller has a CB radio installed on Lewis's car for $40, and the two begin listening in on truckers' chatter. Fuller coaxes Lewis into playing a prank on a truck driver nicknamed 'Rusty Nail' (voiced by Ted Levine (uncredited)). Lewis pretends to be a woman named Candy Cane and sets up a meeting with Rusty Nail in the motel where Lewis and Fuller will be spending the night. Lewis tells Rusty that ""she"" is in room 17, the room of an irritable businessman with whom Fuller had earlier argued, but the guys are actually in room 18. When Rusty Nail arrives at the man's room, an argument and sounds of a scuffle are briefly heard. The next morning, Sheriff Ritter announces to Lewis and Fuller that they found the businessman on the highway, still alive with his lower jaw ripped off. Ritter figures out the two are involved in the incident, but lets them go, as he already has his hands full, and they do not know anything other than the man's nickname (CB handle). However, he orders them to leave the state by sundown.
On the road, Rusty Nail is heard again on the CB radio looking for Candy Cane. Lewis talks to him and reveals that he is Candy Cane. Rusty Nail demands an apology, but Fuller insults him, instead. Rusty Nail simply notes that they should get their taillight fixed, indicating that he is right behind them, causing the duo to panic and speed up. At the next gas station, they unsuccessfully attempt to contact Ritter. Seeing an ice truck pulling into the gas station, the already paranoid pair drives away. The ice truck driver chases them down. However, the driver turns out to be merely trying to return Lewis's credit card, which he left behind in panic. The real Rusty Nail then shows up in his truck and crushes the ice truck and its driver. He then slowly pins Lewis's car against a tree. The two hysterically apologize, and Rusty Nail drives away, declaring his actions to be simply a retaliatory joke.
Believing themselves safe, the brothers arrive at the University of Colorado and pick up Venna. They stop at a motel and drink at a bar. Lewis goes to sleep, but Rusty Nail calls him, revealing he knows of Venna. The three flee the motel. Rusty Nail contacts them, announcing that he has kidnapped Charlotte, Venna's friend. He directs them to a cornfield, where he gets them to split up, and kidnaps Venna.
Rusty Nail sets up a meeting at another motel in room 17, mirroring the false date with which he was pranked. He sets up a trap that will kill Venna if the room door is opened. Fuller attempts to get in the room by a window, but is injured by Rusty Nail and stuck outside the room. Rusty Nail's truck appears uphill and begins rolling down toward Venna's room. Lewis frees Fuller, and the brothers save Venna just in time. As the police investigate Rusty Nail's truck, they see a dead body in the driver's seat and Charlotte, still alive, on the floor.
Lewis, Fuller, and Venna are treated for their injuries at an ambulance. At this point, the dead man turns out to be the ice truck driver. A CB in the ambulance is on, and the group hear Rusty Nail's voice, learning that he is still alive and free.",6.6,tt0206314,"Breaker, breakerone-nine. Smokeyreport. Wegotabear-- Breaker one-nine.

37,2011,Dylan Dog: Dead of Night,American,"In New Orleans, Dylan Dog, an ace detective whose specialty is paranormal cases, narrates how he helped people with their cases until his wife, Cassandra, was killed by vampires. Since then he has been doing regular cases with his ""partner"", Marcus Deckler.
One night, when teenager Elizabeth Ryan calls her father, without getting an answer, she goes to her father's room and finds him dead on the floor. She is then surprised, and almost attacked, by a strange, hairy, creature. The next day, Dylan is informed, by Marcus, that Elizabeth asked for (and later hires) him. When Dylan interrogates her, she explains that he is the only one that can help her and shows to him a card (that is his old detective card) that says ""No pulse?, No problem"". Dylan sees it, stands up and goes out, stating that he doesn't ""do that"" any more, followed by Marcus.
That night Marcus is attacked and killed by an unknown creature (who Dylan thinks is the same creature that killed Elizabeth's father). Dylan decides to officially help Elizabeth with her case. He retrieves an old forensics kit from under the floorboards of his office and rides to Elizabeth's house. After finding a hair sample in the tree outside her father's study, he tells Elizabeth that the creature that killed her father is a female, eighteen- to nineteen-year-old werewolf, who is a member of the Cysnos werewolf clan. Dylan visits the Cysnos leader, Gabriel - an old friend of his - and realizes that Gabriel's 19-year-old daughter Mara might be his main suspect, an idea that makes Gabriel very angry. After he is told off by Gabriel, Dylan is attacked by Gabriel's older son Wolfgang who is then knocked unconscious by Dylan (who was using a silver gauntlet).
Dylan then finds Mara dead in a warehouse and is briefly attacked by an unknown vampire. He then goes to Elizabeth in order to determine what connections may exist between those involved. She shows him a book of artifacts her father imported and indicates that one of the items pictured is now missing after having been smuggled into the country. The same vampire from earlier attacks Dylan and Elizabeth at her home along with two others demanding ""The Heart."" Dylan fends them off long enough for them to make an escape and continue the investigation.
Dylan then goes to the morgue (which is run by zombies) to see Marcus's wound and discovers that Marcus has been turned into a zombie (and he also has a missing arm). Marcus initially doesn't believe Dylan, but finally accepts his condition after Dylan shoots him to prove it. Dylan then takes both Marcus and Elizabeth to ""the body shop"", which is a black market for body parts. While Marcus looks for a new arm, Dylan talks with the owner and is informed that the vampires, led by Vargas, are after an artifact known as ""The heart"". Dylan then goes to the Corpus House, a nightclub owned by Vargas. He talks to Vargas, an arrogant young vampire who denies being involved with the murders and tells Dylan to go while he still lets him to do so.
Dylan then visits his old vampire friend, Borelli. Borelli tells Dylan that the artifact known as ""The heart"" is called ""The heart of Belial"", a cross-like relic that holds the blood of Belial, an ancient monster who cannot be killed unless his/her master is destroyed. After he finds the heart in the tomb of vampire elder known as Sclavi, Dylan is ambushed by Vargas' men. After he awakens, Vargas traps him and Marcus inside the crypt, and takes the Heart. Before sealing the pair up, Vargas reveals that he was the one who killed Cassandra years ago, thus provoking Dylan to kill the vampire elders and leave Vargas in charge. After Marcus digs himself out and releases Dylan, the duo goes after Vargas who has taken Elizabeth to the Corpus House. Vargas reveals to Elizabeth that he intends to turn her into a vampire and inject the blood of Belial into her. Dylan enters the Corpus House and finds that both Vargas and Elizabeth are gone.
On his way to find Elizabeth and Vargas, Dylan realizes that Elizabeth is the real enemy and wants to turn Vargas into Belial as a revenge for her father's murder. She tells him that the reason is not revenge, instead she explains that her family - an organization of monster hunters - are the ""good guys"" and that the ""monsters"" (vampires, werewolves, zombies, etc.) must be destroyed. Dylan says that she is wrong and that she is the monster. She injects the blood into Vargas's body and escapes, but before she can do so she is attacked by Marcus who is knocked down by her. Dylan fights off Belial (who is slowly taking over Vargas's body) when Elizabeth tries to stop Belial from killing Dylan, claiming he should do as she says because she is its master. Belial states the anyone who stops him, including his master, is his enemy. After knocking her away, Belial continues after Dylan while Elizabeth escapes while Wolfgang (who was called by Dylan before the battle) and his werewolf allies attack Elizabeth. They manage to subdue and kill Elizabeth, and at the same time Belial dies in front of Dylan leaving Vargas's unconscious body. Dylan gives the heart to Wolfgang, the only one that Dylan can trust to protect it, and goes with Marcus.
Finally, Dylan decides to revive his paranormal detective agency. Using copies of the same card that Elizabeth gave him earlier, calling Marcus ""partner""; something that Marcus had wanted for a long time.",5.1,tt1013860," Oh, when we wake in the morning   GirIfriend, you know you wiII have known me  And high on a hiIItop, up on a hot rock You own me  You got the right size pepper shaker   Come on, Iet's get our wheeIs on   But you give me pause  You been Iooking so hard, so hard  Dad, dinner's aImost ready!

You see, I used to protect aII of them, aII those creatures of the night. Those sharp-toothed monsters you thought were onIy in the movies. Why? Because they're reaI. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. I used to think the same thing. But go ahead. Take a cIoser Iook at that bum begging for change. Take a Iook at your neighbor your best friend. HeII, maybe even your girIfriend. The undead are out there, hiding in pIain sight. And in my day, I was the Iine between you and them. I was the peace, the cork in the bottIe, the Iine in the sand. But then everything changed. And I discovered there 's more than one way to die. Your heart can go on ticking, but sometimes, that's just for show. But fIesh-eating monsters weren't my probIem anymore. I had moved on to a much safer Iine of work. You think you can just ruin peopIe's Iives and get away with it? You cocked the gun too earIy. What? Shove a gun in somebody's face, that's shock enough. You want to save the gun-cooking tiII Iater. In case the gun itseIf doesn't put enough fear into the guy. You've aIready done that. Now what do you do? Shake it at me? See? HardIy effective, right? But if you save the gun-cooking untiI Iater, boom. Then you've got escaIation. And that, my friend, is the name of the game. AII right. So, why are you here? I'm here to put a buIIet in your head. Not ringing beIIs. You're gonna have to heIp me with this one, Chief. Who are you again? Oh, right. You're the one with the screamer Those pictures are gonna cost me everything. The four-bedroom, five-bath house with the pooI and the tennis court, and the Mercedes S-CIass!

I think you broke my nose! CaIm down, big baby. It's not broken. Now, I know you're upset with me, but I'm just doing my job. You were the one power-thrusting your secretary. Executive assistant. Whatever. You do the crime, pay the fine. But she cheated on me first. God. You don't need revenge. You need proof. Audio. Pictures. Video, if possibIe. I get a day, pIus expenses. You wouIdn't happen to have a check with you? Do you take credit cards? DyIan! Did that guy just have a gun? Here. What is this? You're gonna Iike it. It's something for us to keep up with the competition. Marcus. DyIan, Iisten, there's three key ingredients to Iife and business, okay? I caII it YEL. it's yearning, earning, and Iearning. You know, you reaIIy gotta stop watching those infomeroiaIs. Yeah, and you need to evoIve, man. I'm sorry, there's a revoIution going on, DyIan. It's caIIed ""digitaI,"" aII right? There are certain parts of the worId that consider fiIm kind of oId. Sounds Iike paradise. WeII, I used your credit card, so I hope you Iike it. Huh? Hey. Have you thought about that conversation we had a coupIe weeks ago? At aII? DyIan, DyIan. Look. Now I'm not saying that getting your maiI and deveIoping your antiquated fiIm stock isn't a bIast. But, frankIy, I can do more, man. I want to do more, okay? I thought this was about cases of Iife and death, not cheating husbands and insurance fraud. I want to be your go-to guy, DyIan. I don't want to be your go-get guy anymore. I want to be your partner. Marcus, I toId you. I can't have a partner. I'm sorry. No, that's cooI, man. Hey, speaking of cheating husbands, the CoIIins photos. Oh. Yeah. Wow. Is that even anatomicaIIy possibIe? Yeah, you do not want to know what I crawIed through to get this picture. Oh, hey, you got a caII today. Lady in the Garden District. Said she needs to taIk to you. You hear that? No. What? That, my friend, is our fees going up. The New OrIeans Garden District, where the rich go to Iive in styIe. On in this case, die in styIe. Nice first impression. Might be time for a new car, man. Hey.

No. That's what I do. I'm DyIan. I'm not reaIIy sure how we do this. I've never met a private investigator. WeII, why don't you just teII us why we're here? My father... Let me guess. Skipped out on the famiIy? He was murdered. And he wouId never do that. So... So, you're Iooking at ""the famiIy."" CondoIences. So, what do our friends in bIue have to say about it? They didn't hear a word I said. They don't beIieve me. They don't beIieve my story. They're parked outside just to convince the neighbors that they're safe. What? Why do you think we wiII? After the funeraI, the priest gave me this. I don't do that sort of thing anymore. Sorry for the confusion. Marcus? What just happened? My father was kiIIed by some kind of monster. Look, miss, in a moment of trauma, the mind can pIay tricks. Don't give me that crap. I saw it with my own eyes. It was huge, thick fur, massive cIaws. Sorry, but an investigator isn't the type of heIp you need. I knew you were buIIshit. We'II be in touch. Sorry for your Ioss! Thank you for your time. Damn it, DyIan! What the heII, man? That girI's in troubIe. No, that girI is troubIe. it's not our probIem. Sure. Her father's dead. She's traumatized. She's aII aIone. She needs our heIp! Drop it, Marcus. End of discussion. Okay, stop, Iisten. HoId on, aII right? DyIan, Iisten. This is the first reaI case we've seen in years. Okay, someone who actuaIIy needs our heIp. This is exactIy what I'm taIking about. Something different, something better! Don't you want that? No, I don't No, you don't Because things in Iife don't get better, aII right? They either stay the same, or they get a Iot worse. Five, 10, years from now, I want every day to be the same. That's my pIan. See you tomorrow. Good pIan. Good. AII right. Yeah, I'II see you tomorrow. I'II just waIk then, huh? ""No puIse?

I shouIdn't have said aII that stuff, man. I mean, it's not my business, and I feeI Iike I overstepped my boundaries. So, I'm sorry. And I'm sure you're right, too. She was probabIy just a nut job, some kind of whack-a-moIe. What was she taIking about, anyway? I mean, it was Iike something, some big beast with big fangs and big... Marcus? Marcus? AII right. Let's see what we got. Jesus Christ! Is it me, or does it Iook Iike something took a bite outta this guy? Sorry. With aII the dead bodies I'd seen in my day, you'd think this wouId've been easier. But it wasn't. was my friend. I thought I 'd Ieft my past behind, but sometimes it has a way of sneaking up and punching you square into the present. It was time to get back to work, fast. Thought you said I was crazy. What made you change your mind? My friend was murdered Iast night. Oh, I'm sorry. Who wouId do that? Not a who. A what. Whatever kiIIed wasn't human. Someone was watching your house. Someone who wanted to scare me off your case. So, you're taking the case? Maybe. What kiIIed my father? A werewoIf. A werewoIf? Like in the movies? Yes and no. They're not just in Grandma's cabin out in the woods. Or onIy in London. They're here, in the city, Iiving and working among us. Most have Iearned to controI the change, to controI the beast inside. But sometimes the beast gets Ioose and you get... WeII, this. What did your father do for a Iiving? He was an importer. I don't know what you're gonna find in the house. The poIice have been aII over the pIace. Did they check the trees? The trees? WerewoIves Iove to use trees. Most of the earIiest European cases of Iycanthropy took pIace near forests. Jackpot Fascinating. It's very high-tech. Undead investigation is oId-schooI. This is a femaIe werewoIf hair, between her second and third coat which means she's probabIy about 18. That thing was a woman? That thing was a girI. What are those? Hair sampIes. The most common way to become a werewoIf is through inheritance. Like a genetic disorder, it's passed down from parent to chiId. These famiIies, Iike any WoIf pack, have identifying coIors in their coats. There are four werewoIf cIans in the city. And they're pretty territoriaI, Iike the mob, so this girI has to be from one of them. Hmm. Damn it. What? Hey. What's the probIem? The Cysnos Meatpacking PIant. Owned and operated by the Cysnos werewoIf cIan. I was hoping I was wrong about them being mixed up in aII of this. GabrieI and I go way back. But you know what they say about werewoIf hair. It doesn't Iie. The thing about WerewoIves is that they don't take too weII at being accused of murder. EspeciaIIy the ones they commit. Huh. OnIy ten pounds. You shouIdn't be sneaking around. PeopIe might get the wrong idea. WeII, then, it's a good thing that I'm the onIy peopIe here. Hmm. How's the famiIy, GabrieI? ExceIIent. Thank you for asking. Can you even imagine what it means for you to waIk through those gates again? After what happened? They caII you a monster hunter now. You either have to be reaIIy brave or compIeteIy crazy to come out of retirement. Don't worry. I'm stiII retired. Just on one case. A murder. A human named AIfred Ryan. AIfred Ryan. AIfred Ryan. This name shouId mean something to me? I don't know. You teII me. Someone in your cIan kiIIed him. Accuse one of my famiIy and you accuse me. You shouId know that. Or have you traveIed that far from the man I once knew? Hey, I stayed away. It's your worId that came knocking. And now someone cIose to me is dead. Again. Sorry. Is this Mara? How oId is she? 17? Must be on her second coat by now. Watch yourseIf, boy. Out of respect for our past, I won't kiII you where you stand. You better Ieave. The others might not be as understanding. Cassandra was a beautifuI girI. What happened to her was a tragedy, but I don't think she wouId have wanted this. And what exactIy is ""this""? You, stirring up oId ghosts in her honor. Cassandra. I hadn't heard her name out Ioud in a Iong time. You shouId've never came back. You're not weIcome here anymore, IittIe pig. WoIfgang. StiII sore about our Iast fight? My father shouId've never stuck his neck out for you with the TruebIoods. He shouId've Iet you roast Iike I toId him to. You're nothing but a Iousy breather. You hit Iike a vampire. You know the Iast time I tasted human? They say we ain't aIIowed no more, but, hey, ruIes were meant to be broken. Oh, that's right. You're not a big fan of siIver, are you? After shooting the breeze with WoIfgang, I went to check out the address I'd found in GabrieI's office. Ten pounds of meat wasn't much of an order. Maybe it was being deIivered to a singIe person. Maybe someone in hiding. And sure enough, I hit pay dirt. I found the monster that kiIIed my cIient's father. Mara? The bad news? It was Mara, GabrieI's daughter. That's not a woIf bite. So, is it over? Not even cIose. She was tortured before she was kiIIed. WeII, that's good. No, notgood. I need to know why. What are you taIking about? That monster deserved to die. Lines are being crossed, the kind that end up starting a war. Which is why I need to know, what was your father into? Now, you Iisten to me very carefuIIy. I toId you everything. No, you Iisten to me. When I taIk about a war, I don't mean the kind that you see on the news. It'II be here, in the streets, and it'II be bIoody. And before Iong, that bIood wiII Iead right back here to you. And when it does, no one wiII be abIe to save you. Not even me. Fine. Okay. I think I betterjust show you. My father toId me about this book, just in case anything ever happened to him. After the other night, I checked it. The objects in this book are worth around two miIIion doIIars. None of it was touched. Except for this one artifact. This one I can't find. And why didn't you teII anyone about this? The things in this book are not meant for customs. Your father was a smuggIer. You don't understand. Somebody Iike you wouIdn't understand. I don't want anybody to know about this. Not the poIice, not anybody. Because that's not the way I want him to be remembered. He was my father. What is it? KiII the Iights. Come on! Let's go! This way! Come on! DyIan? Where's the Heart? DyIan! Get in. What the heII was that? Magnesium fIare. Burns with the same intensity as sunIight. It won't kiII them, but it gave us an opening. Not that. The part where you used me as Iive bait! Look, you're aIive. oh, my God! DyIan! DyIan, come on! Come on, do something! DyIan! DyIan! KiII it! Do something! Hang on. BuII's eye. What the heII is going on? Look around you. Look at them. You think they're aII Iike you, but they're not. Someone on this street is an impostor. A Iiving dead. The monsters you read about as a kid, they're reaI, and they're here. WerewoIves, vampires, they're everywhere. Hiding, surviving. And the key to their survivaI is making sure none of us know they're here. That's why New OrIeans became their Mecca. Where eIse couId you hide if you were a creature of the night? How do you know aII this? There was a pact among aII the undead to appoint a singIe human as impartiaI inspector. An investigator. Someone they couId trust to protect them from themseIves when one of their own crossed the Iine. There was a time when they trusted me. I kept their secret. What happened? I paid a price. The bite on Mara Iooked simiIar to the one that kiIIed Marcus. I just had to be sure. What are we doing here? I gotta check something out. Stay here. Okay. So, I'II just scream if a kiIIer vampire comes aIong. Yeah, yeah, he's fresh. I toId you, three hours in the bag. Yeah. I don't know. PhiI, how big is he? He's about 5'9"", 170. Yeah, he's a medium. I'm sorry, but you needing more Iarges, you know, not exactIy my probIem. Hey, hey, hey, pubIic ain't aIIowed back here. Shit. it's DyIan. PhiI, CeciI. DyIan. It's reaIIy good to see you, bud. I thought you was retired. I'm just here to check out a body. Came in this morning.DeckIer. Yeah, not so much. Okay, yeah, the kid. You know, I gotta compIiment you, because you, my friend, have an exceIIent eye because this kid, he reaIIy took good care of himseIf. He's soft, Iike a Iady. I Iike that. Was he a vegetarian or something? Here he is. The bite's the same. Hey. Where's his Ieft arm? ToId you, dude! I knew this one was coming back. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. What's he taIking about? Why am I freezing? Where the heII am I? What's going on? Do you want the good news or the bad news first? The good. The bad. Okay. The bad news is that you're dead. Look at him! You're funny. That's funny. So, what's the good news then? The good news is that the condition is manageabIe. Wait a minute. Wait a second. I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming. I'm asIeep right now. And you Iook great! Look at you! Marcus. I can Iike feeI you, too. That's bizarre. Marcus. No, Marcus. Marcus, stop it. You Iook sveIte, you Iook good, you Iook cIean-out. Man. I wish you were Iike this. Marcus, you're not dreaming. I think I am. I think I am. Oh, no! Oh, no! What is this? What is that? What is that? MostIy your Iarge intestine. DyIan, we're taIking some serious maIpractice shit here, man! I mean, what are we gonna do about this? This is gonna get infected! WeII, you don't have to worry about that anymore. You're the Iiving dead, Marcus. The good thing about being the Iiving dead? No more jogging. What's up? How did this happen? WeII, by the Iooks of it, you got bitten by a zombie. OnIy takes one bad appIe to spoiI the whoIe bunch. Hey, you know what? Those fIesh eaters, they're not Iike us. I mean, they're shredded, they're ripped, with an attitude to match. Think Mike Tyson after you made fun of his Iisp and that tribaI tattoo on his face. That's the onIy way we fit in with them breathers We don't eat them, they don't sever our brain stems. It's worked out pretty weII so far. Hey, you okay there, paIIy? What happened to my arm? What happened to my... Marcus! was in bad shape, and I needed to understand why the undead were on a kiIIing spree. LuckiIy, there was Big AI's Body Shop, where... WeII, you'II see for yourseIf Body shop? What are we doing here? Seeing an oId informant of mine. Where do you think you're going? We're cIosed. Back off. Or you're gonna need some serious body work yourseIf. Thank you. Whatever you do, don't scream. Okay. What the heII is going on here? This is a body shop. Zombies come from aII over the Southeast to get repIacement parts. They rot fast. These peopIe are zombies? Think of it as recycIing. BIG AL No, you don't pick them out of the bayou. They're as fresh as your mother's... I gotta caII you back. HoIy rotting shit. DyIan. Big AI. How's the parts business? Listen, man, I don't know how to say this exactIy, but the word on the street is that you went, weII, postaI a ways back. So, do I gotta be worried? ReIax, AI. I'm just here to drop someone off for work. TeII your hunchback he's in the trunk of my car. Who's your friend, DyIan? She's got some nice parts on her. She's a cIient. So, I had a IittIe run-in with the TruebIoods tonight. Oh, yeah? ReaIIy? Wow. Not a happy reunion, huh? Who's running the show these days? Vargas. He runs the Corpus House now. The creep who peddIes vampire bIood to civiIians? Yeah, weII, I guess the peddIing business is starting to pay off. He's got himseIf a corner office now. I mean, especiaIIy since TruebIood upper management was sent to greener pastures. If I had to guess, I'd say he's the one been spreading the word about you being this venator that everyone's been taIking about, capisce? There's a venator around? BIG AL Yeah. What's a venator? it's Latin. Short for monstro venatorum Monster hunters. ReIigious nut jobs, mostIy. Running around with siIver buIIets and wooden stakes and hoIy water. Jeez. We thought them days was done, but IateIy... LateIy what? Few of the dead missing here and there. Some whispers. Nothing for sure. Man, you have been out of the Ioop. And you wouIdn't happen to be profiting from any of this now, wouId you, AI? I'm offended, DyIan. You know I run a cIean operation here. This ain't no chop shop. Right. WeII, you keep those big ears open, AI. You near of anything that I need to know, you be sure to give me a caII. WeII, aII right, then. You take it easy, DyIan. You hear me? And do yourseIf a favor. Stay away from Corpus House. I got some bad news, Lorca. Big AI's informant said he saw one of our TruebIoods running away from where that bitch woIf died. Do you have any cIue of the heat that you couId bring on us, huh? Of what we have at stake? We have been waiting hundreds of years. Look at me! Hundreds, to finaIIy come out of hiding. To cIaim our rightfuI pIace at the top of the food chain. To stop Iiving off of human tabIe scraps Iike some roving pack of cockroaches. No! No more. The human race is obsoIete, y'aII. Now, how do we do this? It's simpIe. The Heart of BeIiaI. Which Lorca here has not onIy faiIed to find, but he's... He has managed to expose us to DyIan. I don't need to expIain to you what it means to a vampire to be buried aIive, right? The cIaustrophobia, the insects, the worms eating away at your brain. And yet you can never die. It wasn't me. I couIdn't find it. Lorca, I want to beIieve you. I reaIIy do. So, you know what? I'm gonna give you a IittIe bit of time to think it over. Okay. How about years? Okay? Okay. Okay. Vargas. Vargas! No, Vargas! Vargas! No! PIease! NO! NO! I'm not sure that I understand. It's aImost Iike you're saying that monster hunters are the bad guys, which reaIIy doesn't make any sense because since when are monsters the good guys? WeII, that aII depends on who you think the monsters are. Where the heII am I? What's that smeII? You. Oh, man. Oh, my God! What's wrong with my arm? DyIan, what's wrong with my arm? What happened? ReIax. It's a Ioaner. A Ioaner? Yes. They were out of Caucasian in your size. Out of... Are you Iistening to what you're saying? My arm is brown! And I'm not even married. Marcus. You are a zombie. Now pay attention. FIoor cIeaner is your new deodorant. Wisk takes the pIace of soap. Green cIeaner wiII keep your eyes from yeIIowing up, and bIeach is for your teeth. This is your new beauty regimen, and you can never take a day off. You're a funny guy. You're a funny guy. I've been teIIing you for years you had it in you. You're just aIways so serious. I'm starving. Marcus, no, you cannot eat that! Marcus, I'm trying to heIp you. I aIready started, and they are deIicious. So, I aIready know you're Iying. I'm Iike Ioving this. Oh, God. Marcus, this is the zombie buffet. I'm fine. I'm fine. Can you just drive me to, Iike, a cIinic? And get me Iike a B-12 shot, or something to that effect? Might make me feeI... We don't have time for this. You want me to show you your stomach again? You're a zombie now. You either eat this or Iive human fIesh. You know that hungry feeIing in your stomach? It's onIy gonna grow worse if you don't eat. Then you rot and die. I think I'm gonna be sick. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. I'm not gonna eat that. And we're gonna forget that you suggested it, 'cause it's disgusting. shows. Oh, my God. GhouIs? And these ghouIs wouId be? Can we crack a window, pIease? Funny. Dead guy joke. Everyone's a comedian. Jesus. It's just that it smeIIs so bad. Maybe it's you. Maybe you smeII. Ever think about that? GhouIs are humans addicted to vampire bIood. Gives them incredibIe strength and perpetuaI youth. Like vampires. Just, I've never seen it this popuIar before. You're just making this shit up as you go, aren't you? Take her back to the office. it's not safe here. WeII, what about you? I'II be fine. If I'm not back in an hour, caII in a bomb scare. There was onIy one way to get into Corpus House if you weren't a vampire. And that was as a And tha addicted to their bIood. LuckiIy, I knew the game. AII I needed was proof WeIcome to Corpus House. My onIy Iead was a teenage vamp who disappeared at Mara 's pIace. My options were running out, or aIways running away. I'm Iooking for a friend of mine. Maybe you can heIp me out. He's a TruebIood. About 5'7"", earIy-20s-Iooking, thin. Kind of Iooks Iike one of those shaved oats? You know? Thanks a Iot. You're a heIp. You're requested upstairs. And what if I don't wanna go? Then we get to pIay squash with your baIIs. And here I thought I wasn't gonna get Iucky tonight. You know what I'm taIking about. I saw you down there with that IittIe.. . Hey... Lookie here, hey! What's up, DyIan? WeIcome to Corpus House. I'm sorry. WeIcome back. Have a seat. Take a Ioad off. Can I get you a drink, a shot? Hey, hey, hey, don't do that. Don't do that. Don't be rude. Now, I know you and this buiIding have a Iot of history here, but I assure you, I don't want no kind of troubIe. ReaIIy? Then what's this I hear about you spreading stories about me being a monster hunter? Are you kidding? After what you did? Oh, man. My onIy regret is that... And I toId them. I wanted to get you a fruit basket. I mean, for reaI, if you hadn't kiIIed off aII those eIders from back in the day, I'd be paying dues for Iike another century before getting the chance to run things around here. And now Iook at me. I'm king of the worId! So, thanks, paI. PaI. If we're such good friends, then why don't you teII me why one of your boys kiIIed a werewoIf and why a few more tried to kiII a cIient of mine? I'm sorry to hear that. But, no, that's not one of my boys. Mmm-mmm. WeII, then I guess you won't mind if I have a Iook around, you know, for oId times' sake. Ooh. I mean, I don't know of any cIub owner that wouId agree to that. I wasn't asking permission. Take a Iook around you, Jack. Things have changed. We don't need you anymore. So, take some friendIy advice from me and go back to spying on your MoteI Sixes, or whatever it is that you do, and Iet me advance the race. You're in on this, Vargas. And when I can prove it, you'II be seeing me again. But next time, I won't be so poIite. Like I aIways say, the secret to good detecting? Get Iucky. What's your probIem? I'd be carefuI if I were you. These are wood-tipped buIIets. ""Theodore Cuff, Avenue C."" What's your TruebIood name, Theodore? snake. TeII me about Mara Cysnos. I'm not teIIing you anything. How Iong ago were you bitten, Teddy? You don't Iook Iike you've been eternaI more than years. It'd be a reaI shame to die so soon. Bite me. Why did you kiII Mara? And why were the TruebIoods after her? If you kiII me, you'II never find it. I'm the onIy one who knows where it is. Is this what you're taIking about? What is this? Not very cooI, Teddy. Not very cooI. Put him down. What the heII are you? See? That's just what this case needed. A seven-foot taII, fIesh-eating zombie. Which begs the question, are there any actuaI peopIe Ieft in New OrIeans? So, you reaIIy don't know what happened between DyIan and those vampires? No, you know, he doesn't reaIIy taIk about it that much. I think it may have something to do with his fiancee a few years ago. She Ieft him? No, not exactIy. She's... - Yikes. You Iook Iike crap. Thanks, Mary Kay. We've got a Iead. Leave in minutes. Wait, what? Not you. I just about died tonight. I need to know you're somewhere safe. WeII, what about me? Why do I have to go? Because you're aIready dead. I'm aIready dead. Oh, my God! What have you done? I Iook Iike a dead hooker! It was a shame SIake turned out to be a dead-end. LiteraIIy. But at Ieast his driver's Iicense Ied me straight to his crummy apartment. I was hoping we'd find the cross, or at Ieast a cIue. Yeah, you shouId trash the pIace. That's good. 'Cause, you know, SIake won't mind. Oh, man. I didn't know AppIe made coffins. Hey, I thought vampires didn't show up on fiIm. No, it's mirrors they've got no refIection in. They photograph just fine. Let me SSG. It's Mara, the dead werewoIf. She was dating a vampire. That's a new one. We've gotta go to a funeraI. You haven't eaten yet, have you? Maybe I'm just sick. Maybe I'm just reaIIy sick! Did you ever think about that, DyIan? 'Cause I'm pretty sure my HMO is not gonna cover this. You need to fix this, aII right? I'm pretty sure my insurance poIicy isn't a zombie pIan, aII right? You need to fix this! You shot me! Oh, my God, DyIan, why wouId you do that? I'm hit! I'm hit. This doesn't hurt. Marcus? You are dead. Huh? Now, you can pity yourseIf and die a sIow, miserabIe death. Or you can define yourseIf as you want to. But I can't make that decision for you. WeII, you didn't have to shoot me. Seeing GabrieI at his daughter's funeraI was hard enough. But accusing her and her vampire boyfriend of murder might have been what some caII ""bad manners. I knew GabrieI wouId shoot me straight, or kiII me. Maybe both. They say if you Iive Iong enough, you Iive to see everything. This is one sight I wished they had spared me. I'm sorry about Mara, GabrieI. I truIy am. But I need answers. That vampire boy came to me, pIeading for his Iife. ToId me everything about his reIationship with Mara. Everything. He didn't kiII my daughter. GabrieI, we've known each other a Iong time. What is it that you're hiding from me? What does it have to do with this? I didn't know they wouId do that. The ideaIism of youth, I suppose. Thinking they couId bring peace to centuries of war by steaIing a trinket. They didn't know it wouId awaken a sIeeping beast. So much bIoodshed. And for what? Wait, what beast are you... It's our matter to deaI with, not yours. It's too Iate. I'm in it now. When I get to the bottom of this, someone is gonna pay. I hope that it won't be you. GabrieI was a dead-end. Or maybe he was just trying to protect me from his daughter's fate. What the heII are you doing? I was just... She's very beautifuI. She was. What happened? I mean, you don't need to teII me. I just thought you might want to. When I came home that night, I couId sense that something was wrong. The apartment just feIt coIder. I headed straight to Corpus House. I knew. I just knew it was them. And when I saw her Iying there on the fIoor, I Iost it. Nothing was gonna stop me untiI I made them aII pay. And they did. AII of them. They took something precious from both of us. I can't. Three deIuxe cheeseburgers with extra cheese and bacon and jaIapenos and mushrooms and onions. Some cheesy fries, some deep-fried cheesy strings, and Diet Coke. Right. I got you. Hey, Tommy! Let me get a number nine! What's a number nine? ExactIy, dude. ExactIy. Number nine. it's up. What the heII is this? This is not what I ordered. A worm-meaI and a Iarva patty. A warm cup of motor oiI. And a compIimentary hot dog. Why is there a hot dog? Not hot dogs! Not hot dogs! That's so disgusting! Do you have any idea how many hot dogs I ate as a chiId? You know what? I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do it! Forget it! Forget it! Why don't you just take your cataracts and your weird face pustuIe and your bIeeding gums and your ass breath, and you go die with some dignity, Iike I intend to do. Good day, sir. You shouIdn't treat them Iike that. He's a person, too, you know. You know what? Sweetheart, I don't think you understand what you're taIking about, okay? Yeah. I think I do. Here. Oh, no. Is this some kind of, Iike, reIigious thing? Just read it. Is this a zombie support group? Uh-huh. And you shouId totaIIy come by. It's just a bunch of us getting together and taIking. Trust me. It heIps. I needed answers from an oId friend. A reaIIy oId friend. BoreIIi was bat-shit crazy, but Iet's see you when you're years oId. I aIways Iike you, DyIan. Yeah, yeah. Life is wasted on the mortaI. And other women? You never change, do you? DyIan, Iook at me. Centuries on this earth, and stiII I cannot find a wife to Iive past 98. Handsome young man. You'II find another. Yeah, weII, not Iike Cassandra. How very true. This reaIIy takes me back. Dante. I teII you something, that man couId drink. So, what do I owe the honor? What do you know about this? It's nothing. OId ghost story. BoreIIi, I need to know. PeopIe are dying because of this. What is it? You teII no one that I toId you this, okay? It is caIIed the Heart of BeIiaI. And it's been missing for centuries. Five thousand years ago, BeIiaI waIked the earth. It was the most powerfuI of the dead. He brought darkness and death upon the whoIe worId. It is caIIed the Heart of BeIiaI because inside the Heart is the bIood of BeIiaI. BeIiaI cannot be destroyed, onIy contained. The myth says that on the night of the fuII moon, BeIiaI can be created again. AII the creator needs is the Heart and a host. A host? A body, one of the undead. The Heart of BeIiaI injects the bIood into the host. Once that happens, the host is doomed. BeIiaI Iives again, answerabIe onIy to his creator. What the creator hates, BeIiaI hates. What the creator seeks to destroy, BeIiaI destroys. But, in order to destroy BeIiaI, you must first kiII his master. It's a, how do you say, symbiotic reIationship. Their souIs are inseparabIy bonded together. Great. DyIan, years ago, the Heart was stoIen. This symboI is the crest of the Iast great monstro venatorum They found the Heart and pIanned to use it to wipe out aII the undead. But the hunters themseIves were massacred before they couId use it. The Iegend says a werewoIf famiIy was entrusted to hide the Heart over the centuries and to keep its secret. GabrieI. I caIIed, to rendezvous at Cysnos PIant. I was hoping GabrieI wouId stay cIear of this. But my gut knew this wasn't gonna end weII. What the heII happened? What's wrong? Is it bad? It's worse. Search for others. Hurry. GabrieI. There is not much time. PIease, teII them that SIake toId me the Heart... DyIan, there's nobody. ScIavi. You must find ScIavi. What did that to him? Same thing that kiIIed you and Mara. Wait. The zombie? The big zombie? ScIavi. I gotta check something out. CaII WoIfgang. Make sure you're not around when he gets here. Yeah. Hi. I don't reaIIy know what to say. I guess I'm Marcus. And I'm... I'm dead. ALL Hi, Marcus. Hey, everybody. So, yeah. So, it's been a rough adjustment. You know, the smeII, the diet, the whoIe things-faIIing-off-of-you thing. Yeah, this guy knows what I'm taIking about. You get used to it. No, I won't. But right now I have a big probIem. Okay? I'm Iooking for a zombie. I'm Iooking for a massive zombie. And he's bigger and stronger than anything I've ever seen. And he's a kiIIer. ZOE We thought those were just rumors. They say he Iives in the abandoned power buiIding outside of town. In the forbidden ward. Marcus, you have to be carefuI. There's no room for heroes in the worId of zombies. BeIieve me. We come from a Iong and proud history of being cowards. Marcus? Marcus? If I'm not back in an hour, caII in a bomb scare. Ooh. Hey. Hey. You reaIIy don't know anything eIse about this? No, I mean, it was stoIen from my father. Right, weII, it was never his to begin with. I mean, it beIonged to the WerewoIves. Your father had to have known that this wasn't just some goddamned heirIoom for saIe. Mara kiIIed him to get it back. That's. .. But you said the vampires were behind this. Not exactIy. Mara gave the Heart to her vampire boyfriend, SIake, who hid it. And when Mara was kiIIed, he toId the one person that he couId trust where it was, GabrieI. Now aII three of them are dead. Does the word ""ScIavi"" mean anything to you? No. I have been pointing the finger at GabrieI, my oIdest friend. A man of honor. Now he's dead. Crossing the Iine? Yeah, perhaps. But I'm not exactIy biIIing her for it. I knew EIizabeth was stiII in danger. Being caught up in a worId where you don't beIong isn't naturaI. I was weII aware of that at one time. And so was Cassandra. Morning. Good morning. This is a taIisman. As Iong as you're wearing it, vampires can't touch you. You'II be safe. Thank you. DyIan. You are not gonna beIieve what I. .. Hi, EIizabeth. You're... - I shouIdn't have barged in. I'm just not used to you... I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I just... I guess we couId just taIk about the Iocation of the fIesh-eating zombie when you guys are done boning. I'm gonna go. I'm reaIIy sorry. Marcus. Come back, Marcus. So, you and EIizabeth, huh? I think it's great. She seems reaIIy sweet. She seems to Iike you, you seem to Iike her. It's great. You gotta move on, right? I mean, it's you know... It's been some time. And you gotta kind ofjust do what the heart... Shut up, or I'm gonna shoot you again. The big zombie was the key. I just didn't know how he fit into aII this. This pIace is Iike a maze, DyIan. You know your way around here? Yeah, a IittIe bit. Came with the job. The zombies turned it into a penaI coIony a few years ago. They banish the ones who become too dangerous or too decayed. OnIy the strongest survive. And the others get eaten. Whoa. ""The others get eaten""? You mean, Iike, cannibaI zombies? Duck. What? Duck. What the heII was that? Dum-dums. Zombie Stoppers. Cute. Sorry. Come on, we gotta go. Oh, my God. Wait, DyIan. If I ever get Iike that, you'II... Don't worry. I'II take care of it. Oh, you'II take care of it. Good, that's great. Thanks, Kevorkian. So, Iooks Iike there's no zombies down here, so that's gotta be a good thing, right? Not exactIy. This pIace is more overcrowded than Riker's IsIand. If there are no zombies here, it's because they're afraid of something. Great. I'm going down. You're going down? You're going down there with the skuIIs and the bones and the cannibaI zombies? Okay, I'm gonna stay up here. I'II Keep watch, 'cause I haven't gone bananas. Yet. DefiniteIy a fIesh-eater. What are you Iooking at? Vampire bIood from Corpus House. Someone's been controIIing it. DyIan? You okay? I'm sorry. Oh, my God! DyIan! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! DyIan, get me up! DyIan! DyIan! What are you doing up there? Oh, they're fiIthy! They're fiIthy! DyIan! DyIan! Hurry up! They're gonna eat me! Stop! I'm one of you! I'm one of you! Oh, my God, they're touching me! They're touching me! They're coId and they're wet and they're touching me! DyIan, pIease! DyIan! Marcus. You're my hero. What are those? Wooden buIIets. What are the wooden buIIets for? Think about it. Who's had aII the opportunity in the worId to know about the Heart? Who's been foIIowing me, probabIy since I took this case? And who has everything to gain from wiping out aII the undead? I'm gonna guess someone who doesn't Iike wooden buIIets? Vargas has been in on this since the start. Vargas. So, what's the pIan? No pIan. Just bigger guns. Open those. DyIan. What is your probIem? What is my probIem? I toId you that I'd be back. No! What's wrong, you don't Iike the sunIight? Maybe you can heIp me with something. Where's the Heart? What? What are you taIking about? I don't know what you're taIking about. Wrong answer, bIoodsucker. You're kiIIing him! I know. Okay, aII right! Okay, stop it! Okay. Yes. I had my peopIe Iooking for the Heart. But can you bIame me? The thing is, it's a nucIear bomb, man. Whoever controIs BeIiaI controIs the worId. What is ""ScIavi""? ScIavi? What do you mean, ScIavi? Okay, okay, I was just kidding, I was just kidding. ScIavi, okay. ScIavi is a vampire. One of the eIders that heIped buiId Corpus House. AII right? And where wouId I find him? He's a sIeeper. He's a sIeeper. Why do you even care? Okay, just Ieave me aIone. I got pus aII over my sheets. Maybe you shouId get some vitamin E. We'II be back in a IittIe bit. Yeah, and some, Iike, heaIing aIoe! We've got haIf an hour before the sun sets. Let's move. WeII, where are we going? He said ScIavi was a sIeeper. This is where they keep their reIatives. Sort of Iike a retirement home. In a crummy shipyard? WeII, wouId you have thought to Iook here? So, what are these crazy symboIs everywhere? They're vampire bIood types. Each famiIy has its own type. What's that? Vampire bIood. Thought so. ""Sergio."" ""ScIavi."" Here he is. There's the Heart. Oh, my God. Looks Iike my grandfather on prom night. They're sIeeping. Sorry. Oh, Jesus. I'm not gonna grab that. Are you kidding me? Look, he's got a death grip on it, IiteraIIy. Your Iimbs are repIaceabIe. Yeah, we aIready repIaced one. It was great for me. Remember that? Fine. You're a detective. Just, you can get it. Just be carefuI when you do it, okay? Don't just grab it, okay. Yeah. TenderIy, okay? Okay. Oh, my God! DyIan, oh, my God! Run and save yourseIf! What happened? I guess you'II never know. Oh! I'm not buiIt for this, man. I'm not buiIt for this. I think I just Ieaked something. Oh, my God. You know, for someone who thinks he's pretty smart, I certainIy get the crap kicked out of me a Iot. Oh, crap. VARGAS DearIy beIoved, we have gathered here tonight to pay our finaI respects to DyIan, a breather who didn't have enough good sense to keep his dumb ass retired. PIease, don't interrupt the euIogy. I'II have you aII know that I've been crafting that for quite some time now. But recent events have overshadowed my prepared remarks. I mean, what can I say about a man who not onIy kiIIed off aII of my Corpus House competition back in the day but aIso brought... I'm sorry, I toId myseIf that I wouIdn't cry. He aIso brought us the Heart of BeIiaI. I mean, sure, we've had some tough moments, some ups and downs but time heaIs most wounds. And if the rest of your Iife weren't so regrettabIy brief, you wouId see that I am a reaIIy fast heaIer. ELIZBETH Let go of me. Oh, I aImost forgot. I Iove surprises. Here, bring her up. Guess who we found in your shitty-ass IittIe office? Come here. Ta-dah! You IittIe dog, you. Freaky-deaky. Why do you aIways pick the prettiest girIs? I swear, if I didn't need a vesseI to turn into BeIiaI, she wouId... You, young Iady, wouId make a great addition to my IittIe cIan. Mix it up a bit? Get away from me. Go on, take her. You know, she kind of reminds me of Cassandra. Right? Yeah, I knew you were thinking it. She was a fighter. Yeah. And you know what? It made her bIood taste just a IittIe bit sweeter. Whoa, easy. You caIm down. Come on, how eIse was I supposed to get rid of aII those oId bastards? You did the work for me, Quick-Draw. I swear. You humans, you're predictabIe to a fauIt. You puII one string, a Ieg moves. You puII another, you puII out a gun. It's pathetic. I'm gonna kiII you. Okay. Me first. Vargas! WeII, this is a setback. DyIan? I feeI Iike I've been stepped on. DyIan? Where the heII are we? Where are we? We're in a crypt. We're in a crypt? What are we doing in a crypt? Are you kidding me? DyIan. DyIan! Oh, my God, I need to caII someone. Just hoId on, just don't panic, aII right? Just caIm down. CaIm down! Stop. WOMAN 911. What's your emergency? HeIIo? HeIIo. Yes, yes. We're trapped in a crypt. We're trapped in a crypt. And I don't know where it is, but it's dark, and it's coId, and it smeIIs Iike shit! Can you give me your Iocation? And I'm trapped down here with my friend. And he doesn't know where we are, and he's reaIIy scared. He's reaIIy scared, and I'm trying to keep him... I'm sorry, you're breaking up. Can you hear me? ""More bars guaranteed,"" my undead ass! DyIan! DyIan! Marcus! No! What? Marcus! Be quiet, pIease. Listen, DyIan, I'm just trying to think. AII right? What, what is it? LittIe-known fact. Zombies are actuaIIy worId-cIass diggers. DyIan, are you impIying that I dig us out of the dark, scary crypt? Bingo. No. Nope, no. Not gonna happen. Not. .. Hey, hey, big guy! Big guy! No, it's not happening. No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no! DyIan, no! I hate you. That's not bad, actuaIIy. Who's your go-to guy now, huh? Not bad for a zombie. Shit. What? She wasn't wearing the taIisman. We're gonna save her. I mean, We're on our way. We're going. She's not the one I'm worried about. What's the matter, pumpkin? Why the Iong face? Don't worry, I'm not gonna kiII you. As a matter of fact, you're gonna Iive forever. Yeah, see, if the myths of BeIiaI are true, you may even outIive me. But not before you've brought every undead race down to their knees before me. Who knows, maybe the Iiving, too. On, yeah. We're making you one of us, if onIy for a brief moment. See, onIy the undead can become BeIiaI. I know, I know. I didn't make up the ruIes. I have a confession to make. I'm probabIy going to enjoy this. Mors tua, vita mea. I'm sorry? It's an oId famiIy saying. It means, ""Your death is my IIife."" Ooh, sassy! Where is the Heart? It was EIizabeth the entire time. She was the one controIIing the tattooed zombie, and she was the one who had to kiII GabrieI, SIake, and you. AII of them? I knew it. She's a monster hunter, just Iike her father. Hey, shouId I have a gun? I shouId have a gun, right? Looks Iike she's trying to fuIfiII her Iegacy. CaII WoIfgang. TeII him to bring in the cavaIry. Come on. Stop! Don't do it, EIizabeth. I knew that you were the onIy one who wouId find it for me, DyIan. You of aII peopIe shouId understand what I'm doing. You shouId understand why. Oh, I understand why. But this revenge, or whatever it is, is not the answer. This has nothing to do with my father being murdered. This is much bigger than that. We are the good guys. By sIaughtering miIIions of innocent undead? No, that's where you're wrong, EIizabeth. We're the good guys. And you're the monster. I wish that I couId make you understand. No, don't! Come on! No! Great. Oh, my God. Hang on, DyIan! DyIan! Not so fast! Stay away from him! Stop it! Marcus! EIizabeth! Marcus, seriousIy. Hey! Zombie power, bitch. Stop! You answer to me. Our enemies are the monsters outside these waIIs, not here. I am your master! WeII, what do we got here? Monster hunter in over her head? You think you can wipe us aII out with your pet monster? WeII, guess what, pigIet. We're stiII here. And now, it's dying time. Man. We're so discussing a raise. Good work, DyIan. A Iot of peopIe died for this. I need someone I can trust to hoId onto it. I'm sorry about your father. He was a good man. I wouIdn't count my father out that fast. Why don't you come down to the pIant sometime? But this time, Ieave the siIver at home. Yeah. Let's go. You aII right? You Iook Iike heII. Yeah. Next time, I pick the cIients, okay? Hey. I feeI Iike I have something in my eye. Do I have something in my eyes? No. Mmm-mmm. It's fine? Yeah. I can't... It feeIs weird. CaII us a cab. Okay. Here. Just do it, pIease. Thank you. You know what? Let me... I'II throw that away. Let me, I'II get that. It's aII right.

38,2017,The Big Sick,American,"Kumail is a comedian in Chicago trying to get his big break performing standup as well as a one-man show about his Pakistani background. His Muslim immigrant parents frequently set him up with young Pakistani women, expecting that he will follow their example of an arranged marriage; he is uninterested but tolerates the introductions. He also lets them believe he still shares their religious faith, though he has become agnostic.
During a standup show, Kumail is heckled by Emily, a white woman in the audience. He approaches her after the show and their one-night stand develops into a on-going relationship. Kumail does not tell his family about Emily, as they would disapprove, and his relationship with Emily is strained as he holds back, fearful of losing his family who disowned one of his cousins after he married a white woman. Emily finds pictures of the women Kumail's parents have set him up with; they argue and she asks whether he sees a long-term future with her, given his family's expectations. When he says he doesn't know, Emily ends their relationship.
Kumail learns weeks later that Emily has been taken to the hospital after having fainted. A doctor tells him that Emily has a serious lung infection and must be immediately placed in an induced coma with tracheal intubation. He signs the permission form and calls her parents, Beth and Terry. Aware of their daughter's messy breakup with Kumail, they tell him he is not needed, but Kumail stays and the three become close as they deal with Emily's illness.
Surgery is ineffective and the infection spreads to Emily's kidneys. Beth wants to transfer Emily to a different hospital, but Kumail and Terry disagree. Beth and Terry argue, and she brings up Terry's past. Terry stays at Kumail’s apartment where he reveals that he cheated on Beth and regrets it.
Kumail's parents visit his apartment, angry that he is not taking their marriage suggestions seriously. Kumail tells them that he does not want an arranged marriage and no longer practices Islam, and reveals his relationship with Emily. His parents disown him.
Moments before an audition for the Montreal Comedy Festival, Kumail learns that the infection has reached Emily's heart. Distraught on stage, Kumail spends the audition tearfully recounting his fears about Emily’s health, and fails the audition.
Emily wakes from her coma. The doctors explain she has adult-onset Still's disease, a rare and serious but treatable illness; Kumail inadvertently helped them diagnose her when he mentioned she had an ankle injury that was slow to heal. Still pained from their breakup, Emily tells Kumail to leave. Neverthless, Beth invites Kumail to Emily's homecoming party. Kumail asks Emily to take him back, but she refuses, reminding him that while he may have had a transformative experience during her illness, she was unconscious for duration and for her nothing had changed.
Kumail decides to move to New York City with two comedian friends. He tells his family about his plans and refuses to allow them to reject him. Emily discovers a video of Kumail's disastrous audition in which he spoke openly about his feelings for her and she goes to find him after his one-man show, saying she has something to tell him. But before she can, he tells her he is moving to New York City. He asks what she had wanted to tell him and she says only that she appreciates everything he did for her while she was in a coma and wishes him well in New York.
As Kumail prepares to depart for New York, his parents visit. His father tells him they are still angry, but gives him a dish of his favorite food and ask him to stay in touch. The film ends with Kumail performing in New York, where he is heckled by someone in the crowd; he sees that it is Emily.",7.5,tt5462602,"Keep it going for the next performer, my man, Mr. Kumail Nanjiani. Hello. Um, I'll tell you about myself. I grew up in Pakistan. And people are always asking me, ""What was that like?"" Really not that different from here. I mean, we played cricket, which is just a spicier version of baseball. And we prayed a lot. Well, not a lot. Just five times a day. And we marry someone our parents find for us, arranged marriage, you know? But, for me, it was probably that we got episodes of Knight Rider a little bit later. And by ""little bit later, "" I mean, we just got episode two. But other than that, it was exactly the same.  Somethin's wrong 'cause my mind is fading   And everywhere I look there's a dead end waiting   Temperature's dropping at the rotten oasis   Stealing kisses from the leprous faces   Got a devil's haircut in my mind   Got a devil's haircut in my mind   Got a devil's haircut in my mind...  So, these are my real journals, honestly. And this is the woman who wrote them. Poor gal. Yeah. She... She has no idea that, like, giant titties are about to sprout and change her life dramatically. So, uh, thank you, guys... There's no bad crowds, dude, only bad comedians. You complain about the crowd, like, all the time. Yeah, like, that's when they're really bad. That's, like, 90 of the time they're really bad. Look, will you just watch and give me notes tonight? All right? If we both give each other notes, I think it helps. Your notes are just, ""Add more fucks into the bit."" - That doesn't help anybody. - Hey, fuck's a funny word. It's soft on the top, and it's hard on the end. That was truly horrible. - That was so bad. - What happened? - Just watch. - I'll watch, give you notes. - All right. Thank you. - Hey, that was great. No, he didn't even crack a smile. - I thought I was gonna puke. - Who? Bob Dalavan. Who's Bob Dalavan? Bob Dalavan works for the Montreal Comedy Festival, you fucking doof. - He's here? - Yes. Don't you want to get noticed? Don't you want to move to L.A.? Hang out with Elijah Wood, and shit? Nobody's on stage? No. He might've been doing cocaine. Was he doing cocaine recreationally? True cokehead. - Cocaine. - I wonder if he was. Now, before I bring out the next guy, you guys know tonight is Jell-O shot Tuesday! And we all know what happens after eight Jell-O shots. We urinate all over ourselves and puke. Okay, so I'm gonna bring up the next comic. - Confidence. Poise. - You know this man. Give it up for Mr. Chris Jones! Smile. - Chris! - He's like if a serial killer fucked an inspirational speaker. He's like Daniel Day-Lewis, except he sucks. I've tried his warm-up. - It does not work for me. - So unsettling. Just bought a laser printer. Printed out, like, six lasers so far. - Maybe. - Hey, DODD. Uh, Dalavan's in the crowd tonight. - Can I do ten? - No, five minutes. You put out chairs, you do five minutes. - You know the deal. - Come on, man. I'll double it up next time. Come on. What are you gonna do in there? I'm making up next week's schedule. Okay, cool. I was in bed with my girlfriend, and I was trying to mansplain to her that, you know, we... We are on one little rock orbiting one star in a galaxy of a billion stars in a universe... full of a billion galaxies. You know, so I forgot your birthday. Who gives a shit? Like, you are cosmically overreacting to this. Honestly, you are being super selfish. You're right, but you're selfish. Hey. Have you guys heard of this drug cocktail called cheese? Uh, I saw these news reports, so I looked up what cheese is, and cheese is a mixture. Cheese is Tylenol PM and heroin. So, really, it's heroin. Heroin's doing the heavy lifting. Just do the heroin. It's very powerful. You already have heroin. Is Pakistan in the house? Really? You're not from Pakistan. I would've noticed you. - Are you kidding me? - Mmm. He just gave you Montreal? Like, you don't have to showcase or audition or anything? No. It was too easy, almost. Like, I wanted to struggle. I wanted... I wanted a story to be able to tell on talk shows, and instead, like... You guys don't know how tough it is not to struggle. It's... It's a struggle succeeding effortlessly. - Did he say anything about me? - Sure. - What about me? - He... They, both of you. He said, ""Those guys performed."" I truly hate you, actually. We all hate you. - Hi. - Hi. - Hello. - Um, my name's Kumail. Yeah, we know. Yeah, we saw you perform. Now that the niceties are out of the way, um, I have to tell you that when you yelled at me, it really threw me off, and, uh, you really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's so rude. I didn't heckle you. I just whoo-hoo'd you. It was supportive. Okay, that's a common misconception. But yelling anything at a comedian is considered heckling. Heckling doesn't have to be negative. So, if I... If I yelled out, like, ""You're amazing in bed!"" That'd be a heckle? Yeah. It would be an accurate heckle. - Cool. - Whoa. Bye. - Oh. - Don't go. - No, you can... - I'm going. You scared my friend off now. What's your name? Emily. Emily. Here... I want to show you something, Emily. This is your name in Urdu. Oh. Does this move work? I've had some minor success with it. Bullshit. So, you just came to a comedy show with your friends? Yeah. We're all grad students at the University of Chicago. What are you studying at grad school? I study psychology. I'm going to be a therapist. Oh, so you're gonna sit on a couch, and, like, ask people, like, ""How does that make you feel?"" I mean, eventually, yeah. Right now I'm just doing fieldwork with this group of guys who are convicted of domestic violence. - Jesus. Oh, wow. - Cheers to that. No, don't cheers to that. To you being a therapist. Great. To me getting my master's. We'll start there, and then we'll go to the rest of it. So, my roommate Chris is probably on the couch. He's gonna want to try and start a conversation. So, do not engage. Okay. Let's go. - Hey, pals. - Hey. Hi. Good for him. Good for him. Do you want to watch a movie? - Sure. - Okay. Should I just, like, put my stuff down or... Yeah, I would say it's safe. You know what? That area's... Go for that area. I cleaned that earlier this year, so... Should I take my shoes off or is this a shoes-on bed? No, it's a shoes-off bed. I have... I have strict rules. Cool. Cool. Oh, wow. That is totally, uh, an inflated mattress. Yeah. Well, did you think it was gonna be a flat, inflatable mattress? I did think it might be an actual mattress, but you know. Well, air mattresses are actual mattresses. You're being bigoted... - Okay. Uh-huh. - ...towards air-based... Uh-huh. - Towards air-based mattresses? - ...comfort items. Night of the Living Dead? Sure, I haven't ever seen that movie. Okay, so, basically, the dead start rising. - Mmm-hmm. - And the good guys, um... Text Lauren. You up, girl? No, fuck, no. What do you want to say to Warren? She... What do you want to say to... You up, period. Send. That may be beyond my abilities at the moment. Fuck. No. What are these scars? Oh, they're, uh, smallpox vaccination. I thought only old people had those. Well, I'm from Pakistan, and we're still fighting some battles you guys have already won. What were you like in high school? Were you, like, super funny? Were you really smart? Were you... I was very shy. They called me Chashmullee. What is that? It roughly translates to ""dweeb."" I'll show you a picture. Of you in high school? Oh, my God. - Boom. - No. And I'm thinking I'm killing it right now. - What inspired this haircut? - Hugh Grant. - No. - Yeah. - Oh, no. - Big fan. - And you're so serious, too. - Okay. I read an interview with Hugh Grant. - He said he doesn't smile. - No. That's not real. 'Cause it makes his face look fat, so I didn't... I didn't smile in pictures for many years. What were you like in high school? Um... Were you, like, voted, like, most sexy? No. I was voted most noticeable. - That's good. - No, it's really not good. I, uh, had acne, and I was a goth, and... I had this terrible perm. Um, yeah, the kids called me Beetlejuice. I don't know why. Actually, I do know why. It's because they thought I looked like Beetlejuice. I think I'm done with this subject. In fact, I think I'm gonna go home. Wait, wait. We haven't even had sex again yet. Yeah, I'm just not that kind of girl. I only have sex once on the first date. - Wow. - Plus a hand job. Okay, well, I haven't had that, so... You don't get that because you made fun of me. What is happening? What are you doing? I'm changing under this blanket. I've seen everything. Do you remember? We were just having sex. Yeah, but we were, like, in the throes of passion then, and... Listen, I had a really nice time. Thank you very much. I'm just gonna, like, call an Uber, go home, and I hope... Just... Your driver will be ready as soon as he puts on his pants. Were you available for rides while we were fucking? Yeah, but I only looked a couple times. So, maybe I'll, uh, run into you at the club sometime, and we can grab a drink? Um, I'm not... I know this sounds like a line, but I'm not really, like... I'm not really dating right now. I just... I've got a lot of school and work and... - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Just a lot on my plate. Yeah, no, I get it. Totally. That's perfect 'cause I'm not... ...dating right now, either. - Okay. - Yeah. And I actually have a pretty strict two-day rule where I can't see someone more than two days in a row. So, since we hung out for two days, even if I were to see you again, which I won't 'cause you're not dating, I'm not dating, I wouldn't be able to see you till Monday. We haven't hung out for two days. We've hung out for about five hours. - Yeah, but... - Just to be totally clear. Yesterday and today 'cause it's after midnight. So, today is actually tomorrow, earlier tonight was yesterday, so two days. You see, I don't date time-nerds, so that really takes you off the table. That works out 'cause I am a hardcore time-nerd. Yeah, I can tell. I'm, like, very strict about a.m.p.m. stuff and... So, wait. So, just to establish, what did we decide? We decided we aren't ever gonna see each other again. Great. I'm glad we're on the same page. Look at my jeans, Kumi. They're from Citizens of Humanity. - That's the brand's name. - Oh. They're so soft. Touch them. I don't want to touch your jeans. - Come on, touch them. - I'll touch them. They're like sweatpants, you know. You should be stylish like your father, you know. It's not very difficult. Just observe me. - Get some Daddy style. - Yeah. Kumi, why don't you grow a beard? Not like Naveed's, just a small one. - Not like his. - Maybe like mine. Small, cool, and stylish. Kumi, I've been thinking. You know, why you don't enroll for LSAT now? Yeah, sorry, Ma, I haven't done it yet. I like that you bring it up as if you've never brought it up before. How's the stand-up coming, Bhai? It's going fine. Thank you. Yeah, since when are you someone to stand up? You know who I think should stand up is Malala. - She has something to say. - Malala, yeah. - Ooh, I love Malala. - She has something to say. - Malala. - Yeah. I know. She does open mics, and she crushes. A lot of ethnic material, which I think is a crutch, and that one story gets a lot of play, but... You should be on that show - Saturday Night Live. - SNL. That's a great idea. I should e-mail them. I don't know why I hadn't thought of that. You know, I hacked into your cousin Rehan's Facebook account. - You hacked into it? - Oh. Yeah, they were not accepting my friends request, - so I had to hack into it... - Okay. ...and I discovered that he and that white woman that he's living with are having a baby. - They're married. - Yeah, whatever. And then I hacked into Tumblr, and I discovered that they have named the baby Da-vé. - Can you imagine? - Dave. - Dave? - It's probably Dave. Oh. Oh, Dave. Dave. - Nobody's named Da-vé. - It's very, very, very sad. No one is going to visit that baby, and that baby, mark my words, will grow up without a family. It's like he's dead or worse. It is very sad. Kumi, go and pray now, so then we can eat ice cream. Go. - Go. Please, go. - Yeah, Ma, I need to finish. Hurry up, Bhai. Ice cream. And then we'll eat ice cream. Stop, stop. Janamaz is downstairs. Go. Stop. What is this? I don't know, I think... My mother used to make best kulfi. - Your grandmother. - Oh, yeah? I think ice cream is better than kulfi. No, no, no. Oh. I wonder who that could be. - Yeah. - Let me check. I don't know. I'm guessing it's a young, single Pakistani woman who just happened to be driving by our house, which is on a cul-de-sac. - Well... - And I'm also guessing that the phrase ""dropped in"" will be said in the next ten seconds. - Ten. - Ten, nine... - ...eight, seven... - Quiet. Everyone, this is Zubeida. - She just dropped in. - Salaam. - Come, please. Sit. - Mmm. Oh, here, Kumail, for your files. - Thank you. - Your X-Files because... - Thank you. - ...that's your favorite show. Huh? Thank you so much. ""The truth is out there."" - Uh-huh. - It's from the show. Thank you. - Thank you. Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. - I hope you come back. Kumi, there's not just going to be a magic spark, okay? You have to work at it. You have to stay open. - Okay, Ma. Okay. Yeah, yeah. - Okay. Good. I just wish you were better at it, you know? I mean, you've had so much practice, and you're still... - You're not that good at it. - Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Brought your A-game with NAVEED, but with me, you're just phoning it in a little bit. Again with the comedy, the comedy. All the time with the comedy. Be serious sometimes. I am serious. I want to help you get better. So, are you ever gonna let me sit in the front seat? No, I'm a professional, and you're paying for this ride. I don't want to pay for this ride. It's surging right now. Yeah. Sorry. You shouldn't have typed in the number. Okay, the year is 1969. MGM has had a string of failures, so it turns to its most bankable star, Vincent Price. Is this your compatibility test? Like the way some people are with Vonnegut or Big Lebowski? No, just watch the movie and take it seriously - because it's very serious. - I'm gonna love it. I love it when men test me on my taste. I just want to share this movie with you, so I don't know why you're reading into... How many women have you showed this movie to? Zero. How many women have you shown a ""B"" horror movie to on, like, a third date? This is not a ""B"" horror movie. Okay, are you ready? Just close your eyes 'cause when the menu comes on, there's some spoilers in the menu. - Okay? - I'm ready, I'm ready. Okay, I'll hit play. Okay, go. Watch. - I'm watching. - Shh. Watch this part. - No. - What? If you're tired, we can watch it later. Sorry. Just have that weird, like, yawning thing that happens when you're watching a really boring film. It's not boring. Just wait for it to kick in. - The plot kicks in really soon. - Okay. Your loss. Nine times nine. Nine killed you. That was fun. Uh, thanks for the ride home, but we got to stop doing this. - Yeah. - I know I've said that before, but I really do mean it. I can't be doing this right now. I know, I know. Totally. percent. I agree with you. - So, don't call me again. - I won't. I promise. Good luck on all your future endeavors. Oh, yeah, thank you. Hey, can we have an awkward hug before we part forever? - Okay. - Okay. Uh... - Bye. - Bye. Uh, you just promised never to call me again, so... It's really cold out here. It's so cold. You make a pretty good point. It is a lot warmer in here. It is warmer in here. You know, it's really nice upstairs. Is it? Whoa... Whoa! What are you doing? Okay. Just trying to get comfy. Oh, let me see. Who could that be? Oh, I wonder who that could be. Uncle. Oh, let me see who is that. Emily, so has Kumail told you that in addition to being an Uber driver, he also has a one-man show? No, he did not tell me that. - Do you really? - Oh, it's really nothing. It's just something I'm fiddling around with. How is a one-man show different from stand-up? - It's really not. - I guess it's because there's lots of, like, wigs and costume changes. And there's a lot of acting in it. Mmm. And then, like, at the end of it, you've got this very awkward conversation where you go, ""I really liked it."" But I thought you really liked it. I really liked it. - I can't wait to see this show. - Oh, yeah. Okay, you will never see the show because it's... - Oh, you have to see it. - You have to. - It's not ready. It's not... - You have to... - You will love the acting. - You have to see it. They're fucking with you. It's not really like this. They're fucking with me or with you? It's actually very significant. It seems like they're fucking with you. I'm years old, and this... This is home. Feels like I never left. Do you smell that? That's my mom cooking the murgh rogan josh. - Fuck. - Do you hear that? That's my father watching cricket on the telly. Do you feel that? That's the weight of Pakistan's history. Pakistan was formed when it separated from its biggest rival, India, on August 14th, 1947. Six runs. Silly mid on. Short mid-wicket. Mid-wicket. Deep mid-wicket. Mid on. Long on. Long off. Bowler. Mid off. A googly is when a... I have to leave as soon as the show's over. - I can't stay. Okay. - Okay. So, if you get a silly mid-on fielder, you know you're getting a yorker soon. So, to review, Pakistan's biggest exports - are cotton and... - Concrete. - Kill me. - That's right. Eid Mubarak. That's our Christmas. Except instead of the traditional Christmas ham, we serve mithai, which my khansamah, Chris, will serve to you right now. Khansamah is Urdu for ""servant."" If you want to make it at home, the main ingredients are condensed milk, sugar, and love. At least, that was my mom's recipe. Hey, you look like a children's toy from Malaysia. Now would you all please rise for the Pakistani national anthem? Pak sarzamin shad bad Kishwar-i hasin shad bad Hey. Hey. So, what'd you think? - Um, I thought it was great. - Yeah? I never knew that Pakistan had the world's largest irrigation system. Yeah, something like million hectares are being irrigated. Like, as soon as I read that, I was like, ""Oh, that's going in the show."" - Totally. - Hi, Emily. - Hey. - Hi, guys. Hey. Dude, that was... You were in the zone, man. That was... That was the best one we've seen. Yeah, that was so honest and good. And you know what I realized halfway through? - You're from Pakistan. - Yes. - Cool, good to see you, Emily. - Yes. Okay, bye, guys. - Great. Bye, guys. - Keep up the... - They seemed to like it. - They're so nice. So, really, what'd you think? Like, it's a work in progress. I really liked it. I learned a lot about Pakistan and cricket, all those positions. But I just wish that I had learned more about you. - Does that make any sense? - Yeah. - Hey. - Oh, hi. It's 3:00 a.m. Is that, uh, diner around the corner open? It's hours. Why, you want an old lemon meringue pie? You're so funny. No, actually, um, I just, I really need to, um, get a cup of coffee. I can make you coffee. I love diner coffee. I just love that burnt taste. All right, I'll come with you. No, no, no, no, no. No, why would you do that? It's a bad neighborhood. I'm not gonna let you go on your own. - Why? 'Cause I'm a woman? - Okay. Seriously, that's the most misogynous thing I've ever heard. - Why are you being so weird? - Fuck you. - I'm not being weird. - You're being so weird. You're being weird. You're being so weird. How am I weird? I want to sleep - while it's sleep time. - This is normal. Girls go to get coffee in the middle of the night. Have you never had a girlfriend before? - This is what it's like. - Are you okay? Everything is not okay. Everything is not good. Hey, hey, hey. You could tell me anything, you know that, right? You could tell me anything. I have to take a shit, okay? I have to take a huge, fucking dookie. I can't poo in your bathroom because you don't have any matches, and you don't have any air freshener. What kind of person doesn't have any matches or air freshener in the bathroom? The walls are so thin, and Chris is right out there. Please, stop laughing. Please, please, please. Okay. I have an idea. Hey. How are you? I do not want to talk about it. Watch and learn, Bhai. It's all about shifting the weight and the torque. Oh, Christ. Oh. Okay. Hey, you're like a Pakistani Sammy Sosa. There you go, honey. Yeah. That's it. He's pretty good. Just do what he's doing. Okay, great. Mine. Come on, man, just let me... Mine. Mine, mine, mine, thank you. - Why do you get the Chana? - You go on that... No. Mmm. This cookie's really good. They're biscuits. Listen to yourself. You hardly sound Pakistani. ""Cookies."" Sound like Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Such a burger. - I'm not a burger. - Yes, you're a burger. - I'm not a burger. - You're a big, fat burger. And biscuit is actually a British term. Oh, thank you for all the information I don't give a shit about. And you should listen to Mom and grow a beard. Gets really itchy. I've tried. - It's all patchy. - Oh, is it itchy? - I know I sound like a baby. - Well, try being a man and conditioning like I do. What's the whole thing with Muslims growing beards, anyway? It's such an arbitrary thing, right? Like, who decided that, ""Oh, we have to have beards."" Oh. But you'll do... So, there's a billion of us, and you're the only one with the truth. Is that right? So, the sun is just shining down on you right now. It's just parting. You know, I have to tell you something, Bhai. Here we go. Yeah. I've been dating this girl. - She's white. - Oh. I thought you were gonna say you were involved in a hit-and-run or you got caught forging some checks, but a white girl? I mean, that's such a cliché. It's okay, and we hate terrorists. - It's... - Just... sorry. Listen, I understand. You're in America, and you want to mow a few lawns and see what it's like, but... Eventually, you have to marry a Pakistani girl. Like... Like, I hung out with other girls, but then I married Fatima. And we hardly spoke two words to each other in the first few months, but now, Kumi, - she's like my best friend. - I know. You have to break up with her immediately. If I find someone who's as good for me as Fatima is for you, Mom would understand, right? I mean, she wouldn't love me less. Oh, she'd definitely love you less. Slowly, it'd sort of... What's the word when guys stop returning girl's calls? - Ghosting? - Yes. You have to end it now, or Mom will fucking ghost you. Now, come on. Batting. I am getting, like, a lot of bright fruit. I'd say it's very fruit-forward. Mmm-hmm. It tastes like grape juice that's gone bad. - Like... - Yeah. Why do you know so much about wine? Um, because, uh... I was pretty unhappy in my first marriage, and I drank a lot, and, uh, one way to cover drinking a lot is to just, like, know a lot about wine. Wait. I'm sorry. What did you just say? That knowing a lot about wine covers for drinking a lot. Uh, no, I mean the huge piece of information that you're trying to just blow right past. Yeah. Yeah, I was married. - You were married? - Um... I was. I was married. Do you want to talk about something else or... Yeah, 'cause I don't really have any questions. - No. - Other than... When did you get married? When did you get divorced? What's his name? How tall is he? Did you love him? I guess I have a couple questions. Uh-huh. Um, his name was... is Ryan. We met in college. Everyone I knew was getting married super young, so we did, and, um, one day I was at a restaurant, and I saw this couple making out. And I thought, ""Huh. I don't think about my husband like that. ""But that's okay."" And then another part of my brain was like, ""No, that's not okay. This is your life."" I feel like this is freaking you out. - Is this freaking you out? - It's not freaking me out. I don't want to put pressure on you. And I know it's only been a few months, but I just wanted to tell you, I... ...am... overwhelmed by you. It's the last thing I was expecting. This is also the last thing I was expecting. And I also feel completely overwhelmed by you. - That's a weird thing to say. - Why? I just said what you said, exactly what you said. Yeah, it wasn't weird when I said it. - No... - It's okay. So, listen, my parents are going - to be in town this weekend. - Oh, that's great. Will you maybe want to come and meet them for lunch? Oh, we can't 'cause of the two-day rule, right? Well, you'll come to Mary's party Friday night, right? And then we'll probably spend the night, so I won't be able to see you till Monday, so... Okay. Well, I would love to meet your parents. They live in the city, right? Well, they live in the suburbs, and, uh, you know, I don't really see them very much. Have they asked about me? - What do they think? - Oh, um... Do they... Do they want to meet me? My parents want to meet you. Of course, of course. They're dying to meet you. - Ow. Oh, my God. - Whoa, you okay? - Yep. - What happened? - Do you... - Totally fine. Do you need... No, I think I just tweaked my ankle. ...assistance? I took this stupid hip-hop dance class last weekend. You should get it looked at. Do you want ice? - I don't need anything. - I can get you a bag of ice. Look, I'm walking on it. I'm totally fine. - I can carry you. - Kumail, seriously, stop. I can carry you the rest of the day. Stop. Hey, I liked your friends. That Craig guy? Or was it Greg? You know, I can never tell with those names. I'm glad I like him 'cause I don't want have to, like, come up with excuses to avoid him, you know? Like... Like, ""Oh, no. I have kite-surfing tonight."" You know, in the UK, Craig is pronounced Crayg, which is good 'cause that's how it's written, right? Anyway, he's a great guy. I was gonna tell you about that. Are you judging Pakistan's Next Top Model or something? - No. - Seriously. - Who are these women? - Okay, um... You know how we have arranged marriage in my culture? These are those women. These are women in Pakistan who want to marry you? They're not in Pakistan. You've met these women? Just with my parents and stuff, but we haven't, like... But you're not serious about this, are you? It's my mom's thing. I just go along with it. So, what does your mom think about you and me then? She doesn't know about me, does she? No. - Emily, just... - Fuck! Five fucking months of red flags. Oh, my God, I'm so stupid. You ducking my parents. Oh, my God, the two-day rule. No, that had nothing to do with it. Seriously. Red flag after red flag. You're such a liar. You lied to me. You lied to your parents. And those are just the people you like. Is there someone that you're not lying to? I'd love to meet them because then I could tell them - what a fucking liar you are! - You know what? You didn't tell me about your divorce until recently. So, you were hiding fucking something, too. My divorce does not mean that our future is impossible. It actually means the direct opposite. I'm not hiding anything from you. Okay? I'm an open fucking book. You want to know what's in my cigar box? Stickers. Stickers and stamps. Aren't you a therapist? Aren't you supposed to be good - at handling this kind of... - Where are my fucking shoes? Aren't you supposed to be, like, able to deal with this better than you are right now? I am expressing myself! You know what we call arranged marriage in Pakistan, Emily? Marriage. Okay? We just call it marriage. There's another type of marriage. It's called love marriage, and that's bad. My cousin Rehan married an Irish woman, and he was kicked out of the family. Nobody is allowed to talk to him. Why didn't you tell me any of this? Because I didn't think you'd fucking understand, and I was fucking right. You don't think that I could fathom your life in any fucking way? Oh, you think you could understand me? I'm fighting a 1,400-year-old culture. You were ugly in high school. There's a big fucking difference. I'm sorry. I can't lose my family. Can you imagine a world in w... In which we end up together? I don't know. I have to go. Don't fucking call me. Multigrain, pumpernickel, pita bread, hot dog bun, croutons. I can't eat any of it. I don't want kids. People say, ""Sam, you're gonna love it. ""This kid... You're gonna have a kid, ""he's gonna be your best friend."" A best friend that... that pukes on you and shits everywhere and is constantly screaming. I already have friends like that. People say, ""Sam..."" I know you're bummed, all right, but, like... Emily's a good person. I'm not saying she's not. All I'm saying is, this is the universe telling you, ""Seize your moment. ""Be a little selfish and pursue your career."" Bob Dalavan's gonna be here on Thursday. If you get the Montreal Comedy Festival, it would change things for you. You don't want to get stuck in Chicago, right? You don't want to end up like Sam Highsmith, who's been doing the ""People say Sam"" bit since '03. I don't like kids. - People say, ""Sam..."" - See? - Is that what you want? - It's like... Is that what you want for your life? It's amazing. And it's the same material. - What do people say? - Sam. - People say what? - Sam. I'm Sam Highsmith. Thank you very much. You know what, I'm gonna tell him... - He's a hack. - ...how I feel about it. - Fucking tell him. - Never writes anything new. - I'm gonna tell him... - It's fucking bullshit. - Great set, dude. - I'm feeling it, bro. - Killing me, man. - Crushing. Love the new stuff. We should be ashamed of ourselves. We're weak. We're weak. I wouldn't call it an obsession, but I'm pretty good at magic. Yeah. Can you make his belly disappear? - Oh. - Come on. I'm too happy with my belly. Does anyone have a dollar? - I will give you something. - Okay. Twenty? Big spender. All right. Andrew Jackson. Don't you think he would look cool with a pair of sunglasses? Yeah, I really... - Okay. Mmm. - Okay. - Oh, he's... Okay. - Right? - Okay, stylish. - Yes. Mmm-hmm. Okay. And now we sprinkle the magic dust on. Just a little bit. Yeah, you can't do it without the magic dust. Yeah. No, yeah, I need it. All right. - Abracadabra. - Okay. - Watching carefully. - Mmm-hmm. That is amazing. And he does look better with glasses. - Right? - He does. How did you do that? Oh, no, a magician never reveals her tricks. Here's your back, Mr. Nanjiani. Do you think I can use this 20 bill now to buy something? It look better now, right? I was watching this monster movie with my friend. And he turned to me, and he was like, ""What would you do in that situation?"" I'm never gonna be one of the last guys alive. I'm gonna be the first guy to die. I die so the other characters get to find out that something weird's going on. I go off alone to find the cat. I never even find out that there were monsters. To me, the plot of the movie was we're at a research facility and the cat's missing! The end. Denise, this... ...is your name in Urdu. Wow, that is so cool. - Kumail? - Hey. - Hey, Bob Dalavan. - Yeah. I know you. Some very interesting premises in your set tonight. - Oh, thanks. - Yeah. I just wanted you to know. I'm about to take off. But you made it to the finals for the Montreal showcase. Oh, my God. Thank you. - You, too, Mary. - Oh! - Okay. - Okay. So we'll see you guys up there. - Yeah. - We'll be in touch. - Well, what about C-Dog? - Who's that? Uh, me. What about me? Oh, you know what? Funny stuff, okay? I'll walk you out. Hey, do you want to go somewhere? Yeah, let's go somewhere. Hello? Kumail, it's Jessie. Hey. Who? Jessie. I'm in school with Emily. Listen, Emily's in the hospital. She has a really bad flu or something. What? Could you just go, please? We need someone there. We have exams tomorrow, so nobody else can go. She's still in the ER. Could you just go and sit with her, and then drive her home, please? I was there for as long as I could, but I had to leave. Hi. I'm looking for Emily Gardner. Um... Emily Gardner. She was checked in... Hey. What are you doing here? Um, Jessie called me and wanted me to make sure you were okay. - So how are you doing? - Fine. I'm totally fine. Never been better. A 1,000 fine. Just, like, fainted a little at work. I didn't have breakfast this morning. Breakfast, the most important meal of the day. You know that. Ms. Gardner, your room will be ready soon, okay? Oh, no, no, actually, I would just love to go home and sleep in my own bed. Sir, can you step outside for a moment, please? If you want to stay, you have to go to the security desk and get a pass. All right. Where is the security desk? It's downstairs, exactly where you walked in at the security desk. The security desk is at the security desk. Got it. Can I get you something? Water? Juice? Coffee? May I speak with you for a second? I'll be right back. There's a massive infection in her lungs, and all her vitals are elevated. Does she have HIV? What? No. I mean, she... - Are you her husband? - No. Oh, we need to intubate her immediately. I need a family member to sign this. So I'm gonna ask you again, are you her husband? What does, uh, ""intubate"" mean? We have to put her on a respirator, and to do that, we need to put her in a medically-induced coma. - Coma? - Yes. To stabilize her so we can work on the infection. And it needs to happen right now. So, I'm gonna ask you one last time, are you her husband? What's going on? - What's going on? - You're gonna be okay. - Just relax and... - Where are you taking me? You should call her family. Sorry. Hey, Mrs. Gardner, um, this is Kumail, Emily's friend. Uh, sorry to call you so late. Um, Emily's... Emily's fine. Just want to get that taken care of. She's fine. Um, she is at City View Hospital in Chicago in a medically-induced coma, but the doctors say that all... Yes, I did say ""coma."" Hey. I'm Kumail. We know who you are, Kumail. Mr. and Mrs. Gardner, the doctors would like to see you now. I'll be right back. Uh, listen, the doctor will be here any minute. She's just running a little late. Don't read anything into this being the bereavement room. It's the only room we had available. - Okay. Thank you. Okay. - Okay. - Terry, Terry, I... I... - It's... - It's driving me insane. - Yes, I know, I know, but it makes me feel better. I just... Hello. No. Please sit. Please sit. I'm Dr. Cunningham, Emily's attending. I'll be coordinating all the doctors and orchestrating her treatment strategy. All the doctors? How many are there? - Five. - Five? Why so many? I mean, is that... is that normal? Yes. It's standard for patients in the ICU. We come at it from many angles, we confer... After assessing her, we immediately initiated orotracheal intubation. Thankfully, it hasn't affected her heart at this point. We don't know the exact nature of the infection yet, but we got her on a broad spectrum of antibiotics. ...battling critical infection centering around the costodiaphragmatic recess. Our theory is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. Staphyl... Hold on. That's a ""P""? Yeah. That's an ""F"" or a ""P-H""? P-H. No. It's staphylococcus... That was very reassuring, wasn't it? Apparently, there are good and bad comas, and the kind that they put her in, the medically-induced coma, are definitely, like, the good kind of coma. Like... You know how there are good and bad carbs? Gremlins. Those can be good or bad. Listen, Kumail... Uh... We're gonna handle things from here, okay? You've been very helpful. Thank you for... For signing the thing, and... Yeah, my pleasure. But, uh, you can go now. - Okay. Um... - All right? All right. Peace in the Mideast. What about this? I saw a sniffer dog at the airport. He had a boner. Does that mean drugs or bombs? That's good. What if... What if instead of it being at the airport, you quit comedy and never do comedy ever again? Yeah. Fuck you! It's a good bit. That's a funny bit. Just for the sake of the public that they wouldn't have to look at your face or hear your words. That's... Hey, it's okay that I'm not there, right? Like... I don't need to be there, right? What's up? What happened? He put his girlfriend in a coma. - Yeah. - Yeah. - You know, the way you do. - She's not my girlfriend. He didn't, but he signed a paper that allowed doctors to put... He suggested it. She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine. They said she's gonna be fine, so... They're gonna be fine. Doctors know medical stuff. Mmm-hmm. That's what doctors do. They're good at medical stuff. This is a medically-induced coma. This is their specialty. Maybe. You know, it might be a good thing. Like, she might wake up with a new skill. Like, my cousin, uh, blacked out once, and then, when he came to, he thought he knew a different language. - Did he? - No. Apparently, it was... It was just gibberish that he made up. It was brain damage. I got another Taco Bell one. Did you forget somethin'? - Is she up yet? - No, she's not. And, uh, they won't tell us anything. We've been here all morning. I know you guys said that you don't need me to stay, but I think I'm just gonna wait anyway. You guys broke up. I'm not sure why you're here. You don't have to worry about being committed to anything, Kumail. You didn't want to when she was awake. There's no need to do it when she's unconscious. It's more complicated than that. Is it? 'Cause I know about the two-day rule. I know about the head shots and the secrets. She tells us everything. You really don't have to stay, Kumail. You have already done a lot. I'm just gonna stay for a second. Is this seat... Okay. Is... Is that lady still looking at me? Oh. Hey. Mr. Cuevas, please see Dr. Toscado. Mr. Cuevas, please see Dr. Toscado. Yeah. Yeah, come on. There's no reason, uh... Should eat there by yourself, right, hon? It's a free country. How's your sandwich? Best fuckin' sandwich I ever had. Mine's good. Tuna's always a gamble, but, you know, we're not by the water. Well, we are by the water. But it's a lake. There's no tuna in the lake. Whatever. I... I threw the dice. I got the sevens, I guess. Whatever... Whatever the good dice number is. So, uh... 911. No, I mean... I've always wanted to have a conversation with... About it. With... people. You've never talked to people about 911? No, what's your... What's your stance? What's my stance on 911? Oh, um... Anti. It was a tragedy. I mean, we lost of our best guys. Huh? That was a joke. Obviously. 911 was a terrible tragedy, and it's not funny to joke about it. Mr. and Mrs. Gardner, please report to the ICU. Mr. and Mrs. Gardner... - All right. Come on. - To the ICU. Thank you. Hey, can I come? - No. - Yeah. Yeah. Whatever. Hello, come in. Please, have a seat. I know this isn't the news you were hoping for, but we aren't ready to bring Emily out of the coma yet. Oh. Why? Uh, what happened? The antibiotics aren't doing what we'd hoped they would, and we don't want to mess around, so tomorrow morning, we're gonna perform surgery to remove the infection. Oh, wait one second. Dr. Spellman told us that the antibiotics would work. Yeah. I mean, he didn't say anything at all about surgery. So what does that mean? Surgery? What kind of surgery? It's called thoracentesis. It's a very common procedure. We're gonna go in between the ribs and remove the infection. How do you spell that, please? And what is it? What's the name? What's the last part? - Thora... - And the infection is... is... - On the lung. - ""Thora"" what? ""Thora"" what? - And we're going to remove it. - What is it? Thoracentesis. C-E-N-T-E-S-I-S. - And what's the risk? - It's a common thing - that they do? - Low. Yes. My advice to you is that you go home, you get something to eat, and try to relax. She left the lights on, huh? My favorite sweater. - I'm gonna do some research. - Oh, hey. That's the book I gave her. No, I gave her that one. Hey, do you have that little notebook from the doctor's? - This is the book I gave her. - Uh... I'm just gonna clean up Emily's room real quick. No, I... I remember. I met her at the Falafel place, and then we went to that bookstore that's hardly ever open, and I bought it for her. You're not the only one who gives her things. What's up with you? I'm just tired of you thinking you're the only one who gives her things. I gave her that book. - Look at the inscription. - No. No, that's stupid. - Hey, uh, Kumail. - Hey. Oh. Hey. Sorry. Didn't mean to surprise you. I was just wondering, are we gonna do anything? - You got any parlor games? - I... I don't... What are parlor games? Card games. Word games. Play any word games? - Um, no, I've never... - You ever play... - You Can't Rhyme It? - How does that go? It's... Eh, basically, you know, you try to find out a word, a real word, - that nobody can rhyme. - Okay. - And then... - Stonehenge. Yeah, see, you would win. - Ah. Hmm. - Yeah. That'd be a winner. I don't play board games. I play, like... - I play video games. - That's the thing. Everybody now needs, like, you know, a Nintendo. A game thing. The thing. Electronics. 1,000. When I was a kid, piece of chalk and a pavement, and that's your entertainment. Hopscotch. Tic-tac-toe. Throw the chalk at Jimmy. There you go. Three games right there. Jimmy was a real guy? Yeah, well, I mean, there was no particular Jimmy. You know, whoever got hit with the chalk, he was the Jimmy. Uh... I'm just trying to figure out, you know, what to do. Yeah. I... Tonight's no good for me. I'd love to, but, um... I'm actually, uh... I'm actually gigging tonight, which is, like, an industry word we use for when we do, like, shows and stuff, so... - Really? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a big Montreal Comedy Festival audition coming up, and, um... I'm actually headlining tonight, so, yeah. Oh, wow. Hey. I should... I should... Run on out. Wow, that's cool. I haven't been to a comedy club since... Oh, boy. Since the '80s, right? Rita Rudner over at Caroline's. - Remember that, hon? - Christ. I... A pleural effusion of the empyema. Maybe we should go, huh? Maybe we should go to Kumail's show. What do you think? - Wouldn't that be fun? - Oh, my God! - These... pictures are horrible. - Okay, listen. Why don't we go to the comedy club with him? And this... It'll take our mind off of things right now. I don't want to take my mind off it, Terry. Our daughter's having surgery tomorrow. Please. - That's a fair point. - Please, please listen. I need the distraction. - Well, then why don't you go? - No. I want you to come with me. I don't want to go alone. Okay. But I'm bringing my iPad. Ah, it's sold out. I should have said it before you guys had the whole discussion. It sold out, like, super quickly. They were shocked at how quickly it sold out. - Like... - Well, you can get us in. You're the headliner, right? That's what you said. I mean, if you're the headliner, you can get two more in, right? - That's a good point. - Yeah. We'll sit in the back, right? We'll sit in the back. They got food there? Yeah, they've got waffle fries and, um... Yeah. The hospital had the waffle fries, too. Right. I... I actually have never been to Pakistan. My parents moved here for grad school, and then they just stayed here. I've never even been to Canada. So, um, when is Kumail coming? He's coming. Right, NAVEED? - Ah. Huh. - Traffic. I heard there's, uh, bumper-to-bumper traffic on the Dan Ryan Expressway. - That's weird, because... - You know, rush hour. I took the Dan Ryan Expressway here. What is your dad's sister's favorite kind of music to dance to? - Emily's parents are here. - Aunts, aunts, aunts, aunts. - Tonight? Why? - Get it? 'Cause it's ""aunt."" It's ""aunts."" It's ""aunts."" All right, forget it. All right. Uh, is anybody here from out of town? All right, a few, a few. What's your name, sir? Uh, Terry. Terry. And, uh, who's this lovely lady next to you? Oh, my God. That's Emily's dad. Is that cloth? Little terry cloth? It's Beth. Beth. That's pretty close. Why would he do this? Terry, Beth, where you guys from? - We're from North Carolina. - Ooh. North Carolina. Tar Heel state. - Stop. Stop it. - Oh. Home of Krispy Kreme donuts. What brings you to Chicago? Our daughter's in a coma. Yeah, uh, how... What, uh... Where are you from? Okay, it's getting late. - I should go. - No, no, no. - Betho, betho. He will be here. - Hold on, hold on. I think I should call him up. I'll just call him up. Hello? Kum-beta? What do you mean, who's calling? This is your father. Okay, okay, okay. He will be here any moment. I... I think I should make something clear. Um... I want to name my kid Void, so he won't be able to cash any of his paychecks. ""I'm sorry, sir, this says 'Void' on it."" ""But that's my name. ""Curse you, Father!"" I work on the second floor of the bank - in this fantasy scenario. - Go back to ISIS. Did he just say that? Toast is a really strange food. What... What did you just say? You put bread, and you make it... It was nothing. Come on. I said he should go back to ISIS. - Toast is the only food... - No, I mean, that is a really confusing position. I mean, do you want ISIS to have more people? No, I was saying that... Guess what, everybody? We got an ISIS recruiter here. All right, glad we got to the bottom of that. Toast is like a... What is it about him that made you say that? I think we know what the answer is. I don't... Lady, I wasn't talking to you. What is it about him? We don't have to go down this path. We know what's at the end of it... 'Cause of how he looks. There it is. That is like saying that all frat boys wearing country club hats and Hawaiian shirts have shriveled-up, tiny, little dicks. Okay, actually... Actually, Beth, this is a bad way for you to find out, but he's right. I actually am a terrorist. I just do stand-up comedy on the side to keep a low profile. Fuck you. First of all, very clever. What? Did you... Did you write that at home? Toast... - is a very strange... - Fuck you! - Fuck you. - No, fuck you. You're a bitch, you know that? Fuck you! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, no. No, no, no, no. No. Listen. Fucking kill you! What's your fucking phone number? Sorry, everybody. I'm sorry. I... I'm not sorry, actually, 'cause you're a terrible person. I don't want to kick your ass here in front of everybody. Yeah, that's right. I got levels, motherfucker. Okay? This elevator goes all the way fucking down, you fucking prick! I think I'll make tea. Actually, I'll open a bottle of wine. Actually, um, does Emily have whiskey? On top of the fridge. So, uh, Cubs doing good, huh? I don't know anything about baseball. No? Hmm. I'm so sorry about that. That was... I just sort of lost control. - I thought it was sexy. - Me, too. Not like sexy, but like cool sexy, not like aroused sexy. I'm gonna not say ""sexy"" anymore. Hey, you guys want to get something to eat? I know you guys got a formula. You know, I've been to a couple shows now. So is it always like that? - Oh, like tonight? - Yeah. No, usually a different mom comes in to help me. I'm joking. No, it's... It's not always like that. I'd quit if it was. - Here's a joke. No. - No. Terry, don't. Terry's about as funny as a fart at a funeral. No. This is funny. This is a funny one. - Okay. - All right. A giraffe walks into a bar, and he says to the bartender, ""Highballs on me."" You get it, right? Oh, that was the end of the joke? Yeah, of course it was. - That was the whole joke? - That's the joke. That's the beauty of it. Boom. - I thought there was more. - But you get it? He's giraffe, he's tall, so it would stand to reason, his testicles are high. - Yeah. - And a highball is a drink. And you ruined it by saying I wasn't funny first. - That's what it was. - No. No. No, it's good. I like my jokes, like, thoroughly explained. You're just busting... You're bustin' my highballs. Yeah. Hmm. Mmm-hmm. Complex finish, flamboyant mouth-feel. Good. How about you? - My turn? - Yeah. Mmm-hmm. Fruit-forward. Good term, absolutely. Fruit-forward. - Yeah. No. - I'm impressed. This one... It's in the front seat. - It's driving the wine car. - Exactly. It is. I like wine 'cause of the buzz. Mmm. She's a bit of a lightweight, Beth. - So is Terry. - Come on. He'll be passed out on the sofa in less than an hour. Aah. That's nonsense. You know that's not true.  You don't want to see me hangin' on...  You weren't supposed to be on the show tonight, were you? Oh, me, on the show tonight? Yeah, I was. I was the headliner.  You said I was a complicated boy  Okay. I lied about the show to get out of hanging out with you guys, and then I lied about headlining to impress you guys. Well, that didn't work. Also, I think I screwed up with your daughter. Yeah. You did. I don't know how people do it when their family's sick. My Uncle Lew, he got cancer. Then he had a stroke, then a heart attack. Then he had a recurrence of the cancer. But you know what killed him? - Cancer? - Car accident. We think maybe it was a heart attack while he was driving, and he did still have cancer, too. And you know what? He ate sprouts his whole fucking life. Hadn't had a yolk in years.  Then I won't stand in your way  I don't know how I'm gonna sleep tonight. You want to stress eat? Fuck, yeah. Oh, my God. I know. ""Most noticeable."" Oh, now, now, hold on, hold on. There's more. Look. The legendary cemetery photo shoot. Oh. Oh... My God. - Nah! - Oh! Wow! Oh. I laughed so hard when I saw these, she got so... So mad at me. You're gonna wake him up. Are you kidding? He could sleep though anything. - Hey, Terry! - Shh! How did you and Terry meet? I was, um, going to East Carolina University. And I was, um, waiting tables, and, you know, we met at this coffee shop. I was waiting on him, you know, and I liked his hair. He was a teacher already, you know. Thick New York accent, like... like nobody I'd ever met, you know. Totally wrong for me. So, naturally, we fell in love. My family could not stand him. We're all military people. Army pilots. All my brothers played football. Terry couldn't even change a tire. My father got so mad at me, he broke every dinner plate we had. Now back then, um, you go to the gas station, you fill up your tank, you get a dinner plate. Oh. But just one at a time, like cup, saucer. It took a year of fill-ups to get the whole set back. And Terry... Terry just stuck around. Eventually, they just all got over it. - They just got over it? - Mm-hmm. How? Lots of fucked-up dinners. How'd your parents meet, Kumail? So we have arranged marriage, as you know, and a big group got together to go see a movie, but really it was just a set-up so my mom and my dad could meet. What movie did they see? I have no idea. I never asked. - She's great, you know? - Yeah. I know. I feel good about the surgery. Yeah. Me, too. These doctors know what they're doing. No, they don't. They're just winging it like everybody else. Oh... fuck. Hey, it's me. So, um, I tried making some Pakistani food, uh, to surprise you, and either I'm a bad cook or all Pakistani food is terrible. I don't know yet. Bye! Hey, it's me. Um, if you just want to come over and, like, kiss me for two seconds, I'd really love that tonight. Okay, bye. Hey, it's me. So, uh, did you want to meet at the gallery? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! A bird just hit me in the head! Oh, my God! I'm not kidding! I'll call you right back. Oh, my God, is it okay? The infection around the lungs has been removed. We should be able to pull her out soon. Oh, boy! Whew. Oh. Well, how soon? She should be up by tomorrow morning at the latest. Oh, wow. We'll also test the pleural fluid from the thoracentesis to create a more targeted antibiotic strategy. - So this is good news? - It's very good news. - Yeah. - We'll just hold on to her for a few more days, and then you can have her back. She's a fighter, right? Yes. I was so worried. We saw on the news that a train derailed, and we thought that you were on the train, and you had died. Nobody died on that train, Ma. But did they look under the train? So where were you last night? What were you doing? Nothing. I wasn't doing anything. - Kumail? - All right, I'll tell you. - Tell. - I was... I was studying for the LSAT. - Really? - Yup. I signed up, and if I pass, I'm going to go to law school and become a lawyer and do law. Hmm. Oh, let me see who that could be. - Really, Dad? - What? You said that nobody was going to come, it was just... - Gonna be just us. - Kumail, do you know this guy? People say Sam! People say Sam! Do you know him? Yeah, I know him. He should be on Saturday Night Live. SNL. People don't say ""Sam."" They say salaam. Everybody, you remember Khadija? She just dropped in. She was just in the neighborhood. And these are her parents, Rahan and Tina. They also just dropped in. I've just been on so many of these appointments, and I just never have anything in common with the guys. Yeah. You know, when girls at work complain to me about dating, I just... I want to body-slam them. They have no idea. - Right. - I don't know. My mom says I'm becoming like the bruised apple at the bottom of the apple bucket. - No. No, no, no, you're not. - Yeah. - I am. - No, you're not. So, do you want to hang out sometime? Like, without our parents. Have you been to the Cat Café? The cats just come up to you and nestle in your lap, and you just pet them. I don't think that's a good idea. You don't like... cats? I mean... I don't think it's a good idea for us to hang out again. It's not you. You're fantastic. I just can't do this arranged marriage thing. With anybody. So why did you meet me? It wasn't my idea. I'm just really tired. Do you ever want to just be in a relationship so you can just finally relax? I'm sorry. You deserve better than me. People always telling me what I deserve. It's bullshit. And stop being so sorry about everything. I'm gonna go. And do you know what? I watched The X-Files. Like, three whole episodes, and it's a bad show. Wow, they should call this web site, ""everything is cancer dot-com."" Whatever symptom you put in, it could be cancer. Hiccups could be cancer. Come on. Take the fun out of hiccups now. But, you know, this is the 17th best hospital in Chicago? - Really? Out of how many? - I don't know. But Northwestern's number one. How do they rate, - or what's the methodology? - I don't know, Terry. But 17th is bad. It's not great. Unless the sample size is... You know, that all depends. Here, look at the comments. This is why I don't want to go online 'cause it's never good. You go online, they hated Forrest Gump. Frickin' best movie ever. Yeah, I know. Well, it, no, it hasn't been that long. Like, three hours, maybe. Oh, hey, I... I... All right, I got to go. - Terry, hi. - Hey. - Can we talk? - Yeah, yeah. Okay. We got the biopsy results. They are, unfortunately, inconclusive. Uh, we're concerned because it is also... Well, wait, wait, what does that mean? It means it's aggressive. It means that... I mean, they... They couldn't find out what the disease was or where the... Where the virus came from, the bacteria, whatever. But they took out the infection, - so it shouldn't matter. - I know. That's what I said. But, uh, her vitals didn't normalize. And now they say, the infection, it's continuing to spread. It's in her kidneys now. But the kidneys are so far from the lungs. I know. It's an aggressive infection, and they said what they got to do now is they just got to figure out what this mystery disease actually is. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. I'm calling Northwestern. - Just hold on, hold on. - Terry, Goddammit... I think we should talk about... Shut up. I'm sick of this shit, Terry. We're getting her out of here. They're in the middle of the... Of the whole process of elimination. So you're saying Northwestern can't take that information and continue the search? This place is a shithole. I'm sorry. Anna, could I have that? Will you just stop for a second, all right? They are the doctors. You act like you know what you're talking about. - Doctors are not the same. - You don't. I can't find my cell phone. - You got a phone? - Yeah. Don't give her the phone. Don't... You don't need a phone. You don't need to call anybody right now. The... They're doing it. They're the experts here, and... - And I trust them. - One, five... Oh, well, that's very nice, but I don't. Can you unlock that thing? There... There's a reason they're number and Northwestern's number one. And that's not because people trust them. Thank you. Wait, you think you're smarter than me. You say big sentences. Okay, well, you're not. You're not. I don't think I'm smarter than you. You just don't think you're as smart as I am. - That's not my fault. - Right, it's... It's never your fault. Everything's my fault. Oh, there are some things that are definitely... ...just your fault. Okay, that's... That's bullshit. You need to stop freaking out and calm down. And you need to stop being a coward. Right. The greatest hits comin' back. Okay, you can just... Well, you can stop. I'll... I'll replay the rest of this from memory. Yeah, don't... Listen to me... Oh. You're giraffe-ing it. It's the biggest thing they had. I don't even know if she likes giraffes. We never talked about... ...giraffes. Hey, do they know what they're doing? 'Cause they don't tell us anything. Like, uh, Lyme disease. You know, the girl on The Real World had it. - Did you guys look for that? - Yes, we did. You know, she gets hurt all the time, and she messed up her ankle recently. Could that be lupus? Listen, we're looking into everything. We're not holding anything back from you. We're still just eliminating possibilities. 'Cause Beth wants to move her to Northwestern. No. Emily should not be moved. The hospital will approve it because it'll get the liability off their hands. But we put her in a coma for a reason, to stabilize her. Moving her could be very dangerous. Trust me, she is fighting this, and so are we. Hey, Terry, I was just talking to the... - You okay? - Yeah. Yeah, of course. Fine. Totally fine. Just, uh... Beth went to Emily, so, uh... I'm gonna wait here till they kick me out, you know? Just keep an eye on her. Do you want to crash at my place? - You got Golf Channel? - No. That wasn't funny, right? Oh, I didn't... I thought that was a serious question. Let's get the fuck out of here. So... This is the place. Huh. Wow. This place is terrible. Hey, uh, I talked to Nurse Judy, and she was saying that, like, moving Emily could be a bad idea. Really? Yeah, she said it could be dangerous. Like, something... Yeah, I hear you. And... Hmm. I just... I'd give anything just to... trade places with Emily. You know? Being a parent, it's... It's a nightmare. Loving somebody this much sucks. Yeah. And, uh, I guess you've noticed the tension between Beth and me. Uh, not really. Uh, it's none of my business, - so I don't try to... - Yeah, well, it's... Uh, it's there. Big-time. It's getting really late. We should go to sleep. I cheated on her. Fuck. I did. It was just a one-night stand. - Okay. - We met at some bar in Cincinnati. They... They have these teacher conferences. Who goes to a math conference to get laid? Math teachers? Yeah. I... I think I was depressed. - That's what it was. - Yeah. Let's talk about it tomorrow. Get a full night's sleep, tackle it fresh in the morning... She just smelled so... good. It was horrible, too. As soon as I was finished, as soon as I'd finished, I was like, ""What did you fucking do? ""What did you just do? ""What did you do?"" You know, that... that, uh, moment of clarity you get, right after an orgasm. Yeah. I told Beth right away. I had to. She was devastated. And now she hates me. She might be mad at you, but... But she doesn't hate you. Should've heard the way she was talking about you. Mmm. Hey, can I ask you something? Why'd you tell her? Oh, I had to. I'm no good with guilt. Do you guys talk about it? Not anymore. She said she forgave me, but... but, no. She hasn't. Let me give you some advice, Kumail. You're gonna know the woman that you want to spend the rest of your life with when you cheat on her. When you cheat on her and you just feel like shit. So to fully know I love someone, I have to cheat on them? Out loud, it sounds stupid. Eh, it's... Yeah, that's terrible advice. Love... Love isn't easy. That's why they call it love. I don't really get that either. I know. I thought I could just start saying something, and something smart would come out. Hey, did you see Terry? Yeah, I heard him leave this morning. I'm going to Subbies. You want anything? Nah, I'm good. Thank you. You don't want a hot dog or nothin'? Dude, it's 8:30 in the morning. Okay. No hot dog. Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, you can go right in. We just spoke to Khadija's parents. - What are you doing here? - What is wrong with you, Kumi? Nothing is wrong with me. I'm sorry. Sorry? That's all you have to say? Okay, I... I don't... I wasn't that into her. - Into her? - Yeah. Do you know how difficult it is to get an appointment with her? She's in very high demand. - Okay, so? - So? Can we please talk about this another time? I... I... No, no, Kumi. We will talk about this now. We have sacrificed everything for you. I know. Okay? We have left our family. We have left our home. I have missed the birth of my sister's daughter. I have not seen my mother for years. Your father, he had to do his graduate school again. He had to give exams again. I was in my mid-50s. They were in 20s. They used to call me Father Time. Okay, okay. I know that. And I... I really appreciate everything you did for me. But can we talk about this another time? Kumi, if you don't want to be a lawyer, fine. If you want to do the stand-up comedy and embarrass us as a family, fine. There is only one thing that we have ever asked for you, Kumi, that you be a good Muslim and you marry a Pakistani girl! That is it! One thing! Can I ask you something? Something that has never made sense to me. Why did you bring me here if you wanted me to not have an American life? We come here, but we pretend like we're still back there. That's so stupid. Don't you talk to your mother like that. You don't care what I think. You just want me to follow the rules. But the r... the rules don't make sense to me. I don't pray. I don't. I haven't prayed in years. I just go down there, and I play video games. You don't believe in Allah? I don't know what I believe, Dad. I don't know. And I can't marry someone you find for me. And why not? Because I am in love with someone. I am. Her name is Emily. And she's gonna be a therapist. And right now she's very sick. But I couldn't tell you that. It makes me so sad that I couldn't tell you any of that. I really appreciate everything you've done for me. I truly, truly, truly do. I really do. And I know Islam has been really good for you, and it has made you good people. But I don't know what I believe. I just need to figure it out on my own. You're not my son. Kumail. You're being selfish, you're not thinking about us. You're not thinking about Khadija, in fact, you're not even thinking about that girl you are in love with. You think American dream is doing just about whatever you want and not thinking about other people? You're wrong! You are wrong! Excuse us, please. Sorry. What's wrong with you, man? - CHRIS Hey. - Hey. I, uh, never went to the store. I was just listening at the door. Hey... My mom kicked me out for dealing weed at 16, so I get it, man. - Hey. - Hey, um, so, wh... when are we gonna talk to Beth about this thing - that we talked about? - We... we... we... We're gonna move her, is what we're gonna do. What? - What? We're gonna move her. - What you... What are you talking about? You fucking caved? - I didn't cave. - You fucking caved? - I don't cave, okay? - Okay, okay, okay, okay. I know you don't, you don't cave, you don't cave, you're great. But we talked about this last night, - and we decided... - I know. I know. ...that it wasn't gonna be a good... - We're moving her. - No. What? - Yeah. - I... I told you what - the nurse said. - She's right. Hey, Beth, um, the nurse told me that moving Emily could be a very bad idea. Well, Northwestern told us it could be very good. Well, they don't see her, this nurse sees her, and she told me herself. She said... That's okay, Kumail, they don't need to see her. No, it's not okay! There. - That's... - I got it. That's a map of the garage. Don't... Wait, wait, wait. You want to be responsible? Huh? She could die! Kumail, we're responsible for her no matter what. We're her parents. Now, I'm sorry, we're moving her. Welcome to Quick 'n Hot. Can I take your order, please? Yeah, um, can I get a burger with four slices of cheese? Four burgers. Anything else, sir? No, one burger with four slices of cheese. One burger with four slice... I'm sorry, we can't do that. Just put four slices of cheese on a burger. We can't do that. There's no button... Who the fuck is this ""we,"" man? Who the fuck is this ""we""? It's me and you! We're just people! Fucking listen to me! Fuck this corporate entity! Put four slices of cheese on the fucking burger! - We can't do that. - What the fuck? You fucking idiot! Hey! Hey, look at me, look at me. 'Cause I'm a human being, you are a human being. Look at me! Look me in the eyes when you fuck me! Look at me! Please! Today's my first day. Fuck you! I'll just ring you up for four burgers. I'm sorry. Do you want any fries or drink with that? I'll take four fries. I'm sorry. Fuck! ...your life dramatically. Um, so then I started keeping this journal. And the journal is, like, you know, me overcompensating and trying to act like I'm living this, like, cool, rock-and-roll lifestyle. When, in reality, I'm in third grade, crying all the time. Hey, man, Montreal Finals. You ready? Oh, wait, are you getting all, like, dark and moody before your set? Yeah, punish yourself like a nasty, little baby. Okay, okay, I am not in the mood, okay, Chris? I'll get you in the mood. - You all right? - I'll get you all in the mood! Why is everybody saying the same fucking thing? - Yeah, I decide... - Dude, are you all right? Yeah, I'm doing great. Okay, all right, dude, I'm just checking on you. It would have stuff, like, you know, like, an in-unit washer and dryer... The fuck have you been, man? - You're on next. - Okay, okay. Thank you, guys. I love you. Hello? Kumail, is that you? - Yeah. - It's Terry. Uh, listen, we're not moving her. The doctor, they said... Have you guys heard of this new drug cocktail called cheese? Like, that's the name of it, it's called cheese. Um... I saw all these news reports, and they were like, ""There's a new drug, it's called cheese. ""Everyone's doing it in the Midwest. ""Kids are doing it."" It's just really hard to do stand-up comedy when your girlfriend is in a coma. Uh... Not quite sure what part you were laughing at. They say she's fighting, but she doesn't look like she's fighting, she looks like she's just... She looks like she's just laying there. I said horrible things to her, and, um, I said horrible things to her, I h... I hurt her. Um... She loves birds. Like, she gets excited every time she sees a bird. She's like, ""Look at this, it's a bird."" I'm always like, ""Yeah, they're all over the place. ""They're birds."" But she, like... She likes that bird, you know? Every bird she sees, she sees it. Her dad just called and said that they can't transfer her because the infection has reached her heart. Uh... Which... Which means she... Which means she could die. I don't know if you can hear me or not, but... ...it would be really good if you pulled through. If you have to go, you can go, but... It would be really great if you stayed. Uh... And I'm really sorry for what I did, okay? Dr. Singh, to the pharmacy. Dr. Singh, to the pharmacy. Mom. You're getting your tears all over me. When am I gonna be able to feel my face? Hmm. Hey, you gave us quite a scare there, scout. - Really. - Scout? Come on, I call you that all the time. No, not since - I was a grown-up. - Yes, I do. I've been calling you that my whole life. Oh, oh, oh, oh! Oh. - Sorry, hon. - What's happening? - You okay? You all right? - What is that crap? We have to thicken your liquids for a bit. Your esophagus isn't strong enough to swallow yet. That shit tastes like semen. That's nice - for a father to hear. - She won't have any social inhibitions until the... The anesthetic wears off. Seriously, Mom, you should try this. - No, wait a minute, honey. - Stop saying that. - Not the cup. - Oh, come on, come on, come on. They'll charge us 48 for it, don't worry about it. Why are you here? I... I haven't heard her voice in a while. He's been... He's been here the whole time. Could I speak with you both outside? Yeah. - We'll be right back. - Yeah, we'll be right outside. All right. Hey. Emily has a rare condition called adult-onset Still's disease. Kumail mentioned Emily's hurt ankle, and the swelling still hadn't gone down even after several days in bed, - which is strange. - Mmm. Still's disease is when the body thinks healthy tissue is an infection, so it tries to fight it. - Uh-huh. - It's like a big biological misunderstanding. - Yeah, yeah. - So, we gave her anti-inflammatories, and she stabilized within hours. She's gonna take time to recover, but she'll be fine. - Wow. - Full recovery. What are you doing here? I was visiting someone down the hall, and I was, like, I'll just pop in - and say hi to Emily. - Oh. No, I'm joking. I'm here for you. You're an asshole, and I don't like you. I'm not an asshole. I'm really not. Oh, no, you're an asshole. You have a lot of drugs in you, so you're, like, not thinking as clearly. No, dawg, I'm not joking. You're not funny to me. You just make me sad. You make me sad inside of my heart, and it makes me sad to look at you. So, I think you should probably go. Just go, and tell my mom I want her. Will you please get my mom? - I'm so sorry about that. - Yeah, it's fine. Yeah. Um, Emily wants to see you. Oh. Um, I'm gonna head out. I don't think I should be here. Ah, Kumail, here's the thing. Your living condition, it's, uh... It's a potential health risk. And you're not that funny. But you're probably not suited to do anything else either, so that's troublesome. You really made it sound like you were gonna say something positive there. Yeah, I guess I did, didn't I? Well, you know... You know I know the good stuff. I know the good stuff. I don't know, so you know... You know how I feel. I got to... - I got to get in. - Yeah. What'd I miss? What'd I miss? Brick on top of the grilled cheese and... Yeah. Yeah, I want that. - Be right back. - Bacon or something... - Hey. - Hey. So you're gonna hang around Chicago for a while? Yeah. - She's got physical therapy. - Oh. Did you ever think you'd be excited to have your daughter go through physical therapy? It's so strange that we could go through one of the most intense experiences of our lives together and just... Just never see each other again. Maybe. But I hope not. ...threw a bird at you, and then ran away, and you're like, ""Oh, crap! ""I own a bird now!"" Hi, little sad man. Mopey boy. Hey. We have something to tell you. Yes. Tell him. - We're moving to New York. - New York. - What? - Mm-hmm. And we want you to come with us. Are you serious? You got to do it. It's gonna suck at first, but we're gonna have each other, and maybe we'll eventually get paid to write jokes. Mm-hmm. - It's gonna be the best. Come on, dude. You have to come. I know you did not get Montreal, and that is only because you did one of the worst sets I've ever seen in my goddamn life. - Yeah. - It was nonsense. A living disgrace. I would call it shit, but I would be worried that I'd be insulting actual shit. Yeah, it was so bone-chilling to me, I thought a ghost had passed right through me. We don't have to keep going over how bad the set was. I saw their faces and the noises they didn't make. I felt one of my eggs die. Doesn't that happen, like, every month? It happens every month, Kumail, but I don't always feel it and go... And that's what you made me do. - Yeah. - I... I'm packing my things up, and I'm moving to New York, and guess what, baby. You're coming with me. What about Chris? Have you ever seen a pigeon try and pick up another pigeon? He will be fine. There's not enough room in the car, probably. We leave in a week. All right? And I already called shotgun, Chicago to Pittsburgh. Do not fuck this up. Your destiny awaits. This'll be the biggest move of your life, other than the one from Pakistan. Yeah. I didn't have any kind of epiphany or anything... Hey, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink. Hey, everybody. Thank you for, uh, for coming. I just want to say a couple, uh... A couple of words here. Mom, why is Kumail here? 'Cause he was there the whole time, you know. I invited the nurses, I invited him. And, um, for... Emily, come on up, come on up here. I want to say something. - I want to say something. - Dad. Talk amongst yourselves. This might take a... Emily successfully peeled an orange this morning. - Dad! - Yeah. It was... It was a clementine. Full disclosure, a clementine. It's those little ones that, you know, a baby monkey could peel it. But, uh, but she did it. And... And, yeah, so that's all. We just... Thank you, everybody. Hey... Hi. I like your cane. - I heard pimpin' ain't easy. - Right. Hey, could we talk for a second? Sure. So I've been collecting some things, uh, that are important to me, and I wanted to show them to you. I call this my bag of devotion. Uh, so this is, uh, all the visitor passes from when I visited you when you were in the... um... So... these are the tickets from when your parents came to see me perform, and, uh, I... I realized how great they are, and how great you are, and how great honesty is. What did you do? Did you cremate someone? These are the ashes of all the Pakistani women... Not the women... The pictures of the Pakistani women. I thought this was a good idea, and it feels kind of... It feels a little stupid. I know I was a terrible boyfriend, but I have changed. And I am the person you need me to be. I really am. So... Will you take me back? Kumail, I'm really glad that you... went through this experience, but you have to understand that that all happened when I was asleep. Like, you felt one way a few weeks ago, and now you're saying you feel the total opposite way, and the only thing that's changed is that I was in a coma. Honestly, I... I... I look at all of this, and I just think, you know, I just can't do it again. - And I can't... - I... I can't be the reason that you don't have a family. It just feels totally different now. And I can't do that again. Do you understand? - Okay. - Okay? Okay. Sorry. Ma. Dad. Fatima. Bhai. Kya haal hai? Oh, there's no plate. Oh. Oh, I forgot, um, I've decided I won't let you kick me out of the family. Since I'm a member of the family, it would stand to reason that I would get a vote in whether or not I get kicked out, and that vote would have to be unanimous, standard parliamentary procedure. So, all those in favor of not kicking Kumail out of the family, raise your hand. Great. Motion to kick Kumail out of the family denied. So, you guys can just talk to me. Okay, you're giving me the silent treatment. I figured that was what was gonna happen. I have a solution. So, ""Hi, how are you?"" That's just a real basic one. You know. ""Pass the salt."" Practical. ""Always with the comedy."" Mom, made that one specially for you. ""Kumail, how did you become so much more handsome ""than your brother NAVEED?"" Bullshit. I admit, this one is designed to stir up some controversy. ""It's interesting how you can't really ""kick someone out of your family because ""they will always be your family."" I agree with that one. That's a good one. So, I'm gonna leave these here for you. I am sorry I lied about the girls and the LSAT and all of that. That was wrong. And one more thing. I'm moving to New York to pursue stand-up, but I am not leaving this family. My parents, um, they want me to get arrange married. Or, as it's, uh, called in Pakistan, romance! And earlier today, I told them everything. I told them about my life, I told them about Emily. They kicked me out of the family. I may never talk to them again. So, that happened. - What is it? - Can I come in? Okay. I swear, you and Dad are just like my freshman year roommate, but instead of just, like, boning random dudes, you're just parenting all the time. All over the place. In every room of the house. Including right next to me. We got to go. Home? - No. - Yeah. It's time. I'm not ready. Yeah, you know what? You're strong. And you are. And we would go to the mosque and hear graphic details of religious people being killed 1,400 years ago. I mean, like, Tarantino-esque details. And everyone would be crying, like, competing to see who could cry the hardest. And I could never cry. And I was like, what is wrong with me? Am I broken? The only time I've cried that much is during the first minutes of Up. This is a picture of me and my mother. I'm seven years old. You know people, they talk about the... the New York water. Chicago water is very underrated, I think. It's good. Hey, guys. I think I might just pop out for a bit. What, by yourself? Yeah, just hop around the block. Maybe get some frozen yogurt. You okay? Can you do it? Can you walk by yourself? - Yeah, Dad. - All right. Have fun. If you feel a coma coming on, call us. - Dad, it's too soon. - Right. I love you, I'll see you in the morning. - Love you. - Bye. Okay. Love you. Bye. - Have fun. - I will. - Got your phone? - Yep. But you liked it, huh? Yeah. I mean... Yeah. I mean... - Hey. - Hi. - What are you doing here? - Uh... I was in the neighborhood, and I saw that you were gonna be here, so I thought I'd come say hi. You look great. How's your blood oxygen level? Oh, well within range. Nice. Um, this is my brother, NAVEED. - Hi. Hi. - Hi. I'm Emily. I've heard lots about you. It's so good to finally meet you. Yeah. There's actually something I wanted to, uh, tell you. Okay, well, I'm gonna just... - Good-bye. - Bye. See you, Bhai. Are you warm enough? Yeah, yeah. I got my two pairs of socks on. Do you mind? No. I'm glad we're going home tomorrow. Me, too. See? I should've brushed my teeth. I like it. When something like this happens, there's this sort of expectation that you're gonna have this completely, like, new lease on life, and... feel totally different about everything, and, like, cherish every sunrise, and, like, for the most part, I just feel like, ugh, I can't get up that early. You know? I'm sorry, I feel like I've been talking about myself so much. No. Are you doing a lot of stand-up? - Are you... - Yeah. I, uh, bombed my Montreal Comedy Festival audition. Like, horrifically, like... I saw the video. Yeah. - It wasn't great. - No... No. I'll be honest with you, it wasn't great. No. I know. But there was a lot I liked. Like a... like a lot I liked. I'm moving to New York. Really? Yeah, um... Mary and CJ and I are, like... Just gonna drive out, and we have a place all ready, and... - When do you leave? - Next weekend. I... I'm so excited for you. That is so great. Like, you are going to just... do so great in New York. What were you gonna say? What? You said you were gonna say something to me. What was it? Oh, just that I, um, I wanted to thank you. Uh, my parents told me everything that you did for me, and I feel like the last time we spoke, I didn't properly thank you, so... Oh. Yeah. Totally fine. I should probably go. - Do you want to call an Uber? - No, I'm gonna walk, actually. So, this has been really great. All right. - Okay, bye. - Yeah. The scene is gonna be, like, so different with you guys gone. Well, you should come out. No, I'm... I'm good here. - I'm gonna miss you. - I'm gonna miss you. Get out of here, you assholes. All right. Come here, you big dummy. - Bye. - I'll miss you. You're still kicked out of the family. But because we did not get a proper chance to say bye to you, so... Your mother is so angry with you. She's not going to get out of the car. She's not even going to look at you. I don't believe that you kept so much of secret from me, your father. Sorry. Here. She asked me to give this to you. Mutton biryani. For your trip. Your favorite. She made it herself, specially for you, with extra potatoes. Thank you, Ma! - Is she okay? - Right now? No. I'll miss you. I'm forbidden from hugging you, so... ...it was nice to have you as my son. Good-bye forever. And do me a favor, when you reach New York, just text us and tell us that you've reached safely, okay? I will. Dad, can I ask you something? When you and Mom went on your first date, what movie did you see? Satte Pe Satta. Her favorite song. Why you asking? I was just curious. Okay. - Let's do it. - Let's do it. - Okay. - All right. - See you later, dudes. - Let's do it. - See you. - Hey, we'll text. - Ooh, sorry. - Yeah, please do. So, the first time I came to America, I was, like, 14, and I was just visiting my uncle in New York, and it just happened to be Thanksgiving. My first day in America, my uncle took me to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. And I was like, ""This is every day in America!"" As advertised. Every day, they have a party celebrating Garfield. No day has lived up to that day. I was, uh, lying to my parents, I was telling them I was gonna be a lawyer. And they're very disappointed 'cause they wanted me to be a doctor. You guys are like, why didn't you just tell them that you wanted to be a doctor? It's a lie anyway, and I'm like, well, it has to be believable. If I told them ""I want to be a doctor,"" they'd be like, ""Bullshit."" If I said ""lawyer,"" they're like, ""Oh, okay. ""That's something."" 'Cause there's a strict hierarchy. It's doctor, engineer, lawyer, hundreds of jobs, ISIS, then comedian. Ah, I'm sorry. It's very rude to heckle comedians. Oh, that wasn't a heckle. I just kind of whoo-hoo'd for you. Well, see, that's a common misconception. Heckling doesn't have to be negative. So if I was like, ""Oh, my God, you're amazing in bed!"" That would be a... ...heckle? Yeah, and now you're getting more laughs than me, and I don't like that. Do you want to come up, do my job? Let's talk about... So, are you from out of town, ma'am? - Chicago. - Ooh, Windy City. And what brings you to New York? - Here to see someone. - And, um... Have you seen him? Or her? I mean, I don't... I don't know what your deal is, but... Yeah, I've seen him."
39,2002, Narc,American,"Undercover narcotics officer Nick Tellis chases a drug dealer through the streets of Detroit after Tellis' identity has been discovered. During the pursuit, the dealer holds a child hostage. Tellis shoots and kills the dealer, but a stray bullet hits the child's pregnant mother, causing her to miscarry.
Eighteen months later, the Detroit Police Department asks Tellis to investigate the murder of an undercover narcotics officer named Michael Calvess. Tellis is initially reluctant, but reads the investigation files and agrees to take the case on two conditions. First, he will get a desk job if he secures a conviction. Second, he is partnered with detective Henry Oak, whom Tellis is aware of from the files. Tellis' reason for wanting Oak is his opinion that the only useful evidence in the investigation came from him. The department chief informs Tellis of Oak's reputation, but also warns him about his instability. Oak is assigned to the case.
Oak believes the department wants the Calvess case buried. He reveals that his wife died of cancer, and they had no children. He recalls a drug bust decades prior, where he found a ten-year-old girl who was being sold into prostitution by her stepfather, resulting in Oak beating the man. He sees parallels between that case and the current one.
Meanwhile, Tellis' wife is worried about her husband. Tellis visits Calvess' widow Kathryn, and asks about her relationship with her husband while he was on the street. Oak, who is protective of Kathryn and her children, turns up at the house and is furious at Tellis.
Tellis and Oak visit the scene of an apparent murder of a drug dealer, shot dead in his bathtub. Tellis discovers the bullet had no fire-pin mark, and surmises that the man used it as a bong and forgot it was loaded. Once heated, the shotgun discharged, killing him. Tellis also notes that the shotgun in question is a SWAT weapon with the serial number filed off.
Determining that this lead is fruitless, they visit the house of a man involved in the initial shootout involving Tellis. Although they find no evidence to suggest he murdered Calvess, they find another officer's badge on the premises. The man pulls a gun and wounds Tellis before Oak kills him in self-defense.
At home, Tellis' wife leaves him. The case is closed as Sheps is determined to be Calvess' killer. Tellis and Oak are furious as they believe the killer is yet to be found, and continue to investigate independently.
Oak determines that suspects are in an auto body shop. There, Oak finds and disarms one suspect while Tellis chases another outside and shoots him in the leg. After they are bound, Oak attempts to force a confession out of them. Tellis is increasingly suspicious of Oak's tactics, especially after viewing files that suggest Oak had thrown out prostitution charges for a woman. Oak finds police issue guns in the trunk of one man's car, including one that belonged to Calvess, and he beats both men until Tellis tells him to get CSI tools from the car.
When Oak leaves the room, Tellis locks the door, turns on the tape recorder, and asks for the truth. The dealers explain that Calvess blew Tellis' cover eighteen months before, causing the shootout. They recount Calvess' degeneration into chemical dependency. On the day of the murder, Calvess tried to deal with the two dealers, but it went badly. At that point Oak arrived, having trailed Calvess to confirm rumors that he was an addict. Calvess went for his weapon, which was the dealers' justification for attacking him. The two men ran off as Oak shot at them.
Tellis confronts Oak, telling him that the dealers claim Oak shot at them, hitting one in the shoulder, before murdering Calvess. Oak denies this, then Tellis raises the issue of Oaks' relationship with Calvess' wife Kathryn.
Kathryn was the ten-year-old girl who was pimped out by her stepfather. Oak considers her the daughter he never had, and has remained close. He has been protecting her by covering crimes she committed in her teenage years. Tellis tells Oak he will make the arrest, and Oak beats him with the shotgun, and resumes brutalizing the dealers. He turns the tape recorder on and attempts to beat a confession out of the men, threatening to shoot them. Tellis breaks into their car, retrieves a gun, calls for back-up, and re-enters the building. He shoots Oak when Oak refuses to put his gun down. Tellis moves to aid Oak, and, realizing he's dying, pleads for the truth of what happened the night Calvess died.
Oak explains that Calvess shot at the dealers as they fled from Oak, leaving the shoulder wound. Oak argued with him, explaining that he had had enough of defending Calvess and would turn him in to the Department. In despair, Calvess took his gun and shot himself. Oak had been protecting his name and family, so Calvess' wife could receive his pension. Oak's motive was to convict the dealers who he felt made Mike a junkie. Oak dies in Tellis' arms, leaving the confession on tape.",8.5,tt12163674,"indistinct chatter My name is Gene Hasenfus. Where are you from? Marinette, Wisconsin. Can you tell us how you came to be here? I was shot out of the sky. REPORTER: A Wisconsin man has been the focus of international news this week. 45-year-old Eugene Hasenfus of Marinette was captured in Nicaragua after his cargo plane was shot down. Hasenfus said his mission was directed by the CIA, but US officials say the flights were privately directed. There must be no Soviet beachhead in Central America. There is no doubt that the President wanted the policy of support for the Nicaraguan resistance pursued, and I did so to the very best of my abilities. Because there's kind of nagging away that I knew something about an operation with these Contras and all, which isn't true. Now, do I support the Contras? You bet. There are notations to ""conversations with VP,"" ""met with VP."" MAN: ""Calls from VP,"" ""Felix talking about VP."" Things like that. There's lots of other references. Good afternoon, Mr. Rodriguez. Your true name is Felix Rodriguez, correct? That is correct, sir. And you have also been known by the name of Max Gomez, correct? Yes, sir. BERRELLEZ: Felix Rodriguez was a CIA operative. He interrogated Kiki Camarena and was there at the scene where Kiki was killed.  NARRATOR: While Kiki Camarena investigated the Guadalajara Cartel in the early 1980s, the CIA waged a secret war that led to the scandal called Iran-Contra. It was in Nicaragua, where a Communist regime was under siege by the Contras. A guerrilla army, funded, armed, and trained by the CIA. REAGAN: Until these men are successful in their freedom struggle, there will be no peace in Central America. NARRATOR: In 1984, one year before Camarena was murdered, the US Congress cut off funding to the Contras, and passed a law banning the CIA from backing the anti-communist rebels. In response, CIA and National Security Council officials cooked up new, covert ways to get money and guns to the Contras. Senate hearings and media investigations later alleged that CIA operatives smuggled tons of cocaine into the US to fund the illegal war in Nicaragua. But until now, it's remained a mystery how the war on communism and the war on drugs collided to make a martyr of Kiki Camarena. BERRELLEZ: During the investigation, the name of Max Gomez, a Cuban, kept coming up. So, I do photo lineups, pictures of Hispanic males, and included Ismael Felix Rodriguez. And I asked René, ""Do you see anybody here that interrogated Kiki Camarena?"" And he goes, ""Yeah, this guy right here, I told you about him, Max Gomez."" I go to Godoy with the same photo lineup. I says, ""Who do you see here that was involved in pre-abduction meetings, and might've been involved in picking up Kiki?"" ""Max Gomez, this guy right here, the guy that I've heard on the tapes interrogating Kiki Camarena."" Boom. I go to Ramon Lira. ""Who do you see that you recognize here was at Lope de Vega?"" He says, ""Ismael Felix Rodriguez right there, I told you about him, that's him."" I identified him. I go to my people and I says, ""Run this guy all over!"" And he lit up like a Christmas tree. I mean, this guy is all over the place. HOLM: Felix Rodriguez worked for the CIA. He was on the hunt for Che Guevara in Bolivia when they tracked him down and the Bolivian army killed him. Then, he was assigned to Operation Phoenix in Vietnam where they identified and assassinated Vietcong commanders. The guy's a legend. REPORTER: Felix Rodriguez was born in Cuba in into a life of comfort and privilege. Early on he was fascinated by guns and the military. But when Fidel Castro overthrew the US-backed Bautista regime in 1959, Rodriguez became obsessed with just one goal, to liberate Cuba from communism. How did the CIA get to you? Well, I got to them. BERRELLEZ: Felix Rodriguez participated in the Bay of Pigs. And by the way, he's very close to old man Bush. MIKE WALLACE: Rodriguez says he first went to Salvador in on his own initiative as a private citizen to help the Salvadorians in their fight against the Communists. Just months after arriving in Salvador, Rodriguez says he received a letter from Oliver North, whom he had met in Washington, a letter that began, ""Dear Felix, after reading this letter, please destroy it."" North went on to recruit Rodriguez into managing the illegal Contra resupply operation headquartered at the Ilopango Airbase outside San Salvador. Felix Rodriguez was an experienced interrogator. What business did he have interrogating DEA Agent Enrique Camarena? I have another question, sir. You've been in that part of the world for a long time. Were you aware of any drugs being transported out of Central America into the United States? No, sir. Never heard of that? Well, I have heard of that, but direct knowledge of it, I haven't, or participation or any type of that thing. Did you hear of any activity by those contracted by Americans? What I have seen in the papers, sir. Other than that, you're not aware of it. No, sir. BERRELLEZ: I went to Godoy and said, ""Where have you seen this guy Max GomezFelix Rodriguez?"" And he said, ""Well, one time, ""we were sent by Fonseca to the airport, ""and we met with this guy Max GomezFelix Rodriguez. And he delivered a whole bunch of weapons to us."" Not only did I see Max Gomez at the airport, I also saw him in safe houses taking money in bags, narco-dollars, blood money, death money... Blood money. BERRELLEZ: He was delivering weapons to Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo? ""Definitely, yes he was."" And I went to Ramon Lira. ""Ramon, tell me about this guy Felix Rodriguez, who is he?"" ""He's a CIA guy, I told you already. He would bring weapons to Fonseca."" This was in mid-1984, when he delivered a shipment of AK-47s and hand grenades to a house owned by Ernesto Fonseca, located down Mar Marmara Street. At one point, Fonseca and Felix Rodriguez disappeared. They went to talk inside a room. After a while, Felix Rodriguez came out of the room with a suitcase. The suitcase wasn't full of clothes. It was packed with money. BERRELLEZ: Blew my mind. I said, what am I dealing with here? This is not the Camarena case that I thought I was supposed to be investigating. It seems like our own government's involved, the CIA's involved, the DFS is involved. Then, I'm really now getting like worried about this investigation, where am I going with this stuff? I kept focusing in on Max Gomez. And I asked, ""Rene, where did you see this guy?"" LOPEZ: I saw him on three occasions. When the kidnapping of Kiki was planned. He was at the Hotel Fiesta Americana and at the Hyatt Hotel. GODOY: At the Hyatt Hotel, in another meeting, I also heard the plans being made. They wanted to kidnap a DEA agent. I saw Felix Rodriguez again on February 6th, 1985, in a house owned by Rafael Caro Quintero, located on Hidalgo Avenue. Felix Rodriguez was there, Felix Gallardo was there. Caro Quintero was there. Manuel Bartlett Diaz was there. General Arevalo Gardoqui was there. General Vinicio Santoyo Feria was there. It was a meeting of the cartel leaders. What a coincidence this meeting happened the night before the kidnapping, torture and murder of Camarena. The top Narco leaders held a meeting, along with politicians, CIA, Mexican Army. Call it whatever you want. What a coincidence this took place one day before the capture, torture, and death of Camarena. I then went back to Rene and I said, ""Where else did you see this guy, Rodriguez, the CIA guy?"" ""I also saw him at Rancho Veracruz."" LOPEZ: We went to the ranch in Veracruz, we flew with Ernesto Fonseca on his jet. When we landed at the ranch, I saw a lot of people there. I was really impressed. I'd never seen anything like it before. So many weapons, so many drugs. Especially cocaine. Some 10, tons. They were in big packages. I'd seen a lot of marijuana before. But this was cocaine, weapons, money. And a lot of important people, a lot of the big shots. It was a very big ranch. And the air strip, well, it was very professional. Even with workers who directed planes like at the airport. INTERVIEWER: And what did they explain to you about the ranch? No, no, they didn't give you any explanation. You were never given an explanation. I was just a bodyguard. Of course, you could see everything there. INTERVIEWER: And who owned the ranch? That was Caro Quintero's ranch. INTERVIEWER: And what were they loading or unloading from the planes? Well, when we arrived at the ranch, the cocaine was already there. They were unloading weapons from a plane. They finished unloading the weapons and started to load the drugs. BERRELLEZ: ""What else did you see there?"" ""Well, we saw military operations, people training there, ""shooting fields and stuff like that. ""And there was a big airstrip with American government planes."" LIRA: They would not stop asking him the same questions. What had he found out about the CIA, what investigations he had into the CIA, the nexus of the CIA with drug trafficking, and what he knew about the relationship between the Mexican government, the CIA, and the Narcos. MAN: I've been spending some time looking at the numbers here of the amount of aid that the Contras were getting at various times... ...and I come to the conclusion that we're missing something. That there's got to be another source of funding for the Contras... Well, I don't think I can help you there. I don't know of anything else. I think there's gotta be some other source of funds that we - we meaning this committee - has not yet uncovered. BERRELLEZ: Guillermo González Calderoni, he worked well with DEA even though he also received money from the cartels. When the president of Mexico asked for his arrest, he knew that he was going to be killed, so he calls me and he says, ""Hector,"" he says, ""You gotta help me. ""They're gonna kill me in my own country here. ""The president Carlos Salinas and his brother are out to get me."" Raul Salinas, the president's brother in Mexico was a major drug dealer. And I says, ""Guillermo, run to the States, I'll hide you over here."" And I hid him in Palm Springs. He told me that in favor of me saving his life, he was now gonna save my life. And I said, ""How are you gonna save my life?"" He says, ""Take this advice,"" and first he told me in Spanish. ""Get out of this investigation, ""you're just going to make yourself stink, brother. ""They don't want you to solve the Camarena case. ""Your own government ordered him killed. ""Don't you know that all the cocaine coming in right now ""is being brought in by the CIA ""to support that dirty war in Nicaragua? Aren't you aware what happened in Nicaragua?"" I said, ""Well, yeah, the Sandonista government took over."" ""Yeah, and who funded them? Who supported them? ""The Russians and the damn Cubans. ""And they overthrew the Anastasio Somoza government. ""The Contras are his old guard ""and Felix Rodriguez, and those guys ""are arming them with drug monies. You getting the picture?"" He says Kiki Camarena was picked up because they thought that he was about to uncover the nexus of the CIA, DFS together with the drug lords to fund a war which has not been authorized in Nicaragua. The drug traffickers were used. INTERVIEWER: Mike Holm was there? Mike Holm can corroborate that? BERRELLEZ: Yes, he was. HOLM: Guillermo Calderoni defected from the Mexican Federal Judicial Police, and Hector linked up with him in Palm Springs. He told us about corruption in Mexico, and he also told Hector, ""Stop investigating the murder of Kiki Camarena, your government killed him."" Hector Berrellez, he was uncovering stuff that was unbelievable. He was putting it on reports of investigation, we call them DEA 6's. BERRELLEZ: DEA 6's are numbered, catalogued, they are investigative reports that you cannot get rid of. Once you write it in a DEA 6, it's set in stone, it cannot be destroyed. JORDAN: Being in the senior executive level, I know that he was told to stop putting the involvement of CIA operations into DEA 6's. Now, you put it in a memo, you can do the Ollie North shuffle and shred. INTERVIEWER: What was the reaction when he brought back his findings with regards to Felix Rodriguez' presence at Camarena's torture? Classified, don't get involved. ""You don't have the jurisdiction to investigate him. You know, he's with the CIA."" ""So, what do I do about him?"" ""Write the memo, ""send him up to the Inspector General's office. ""They have jurisdiction to investigate that aspect of it. You just stay with the drug lords."" I'm naive, I'm dumb. I figure ""Okay, somebody's gonna go after him."" I have to tell you, Hector sent information back to them in boxes. He sent them back to DEA headquarters, they disappeared. BERRELLEZ: So I flew into Washington and I met with the Administrator. Jack Lawn, he asked me if I could conduct an extraterritorial rendition. I looked at him like I'm kinda dumb, and I said, ""What's that?"" He kinda smiled and he laughed a little bit, and he goes ""Kidnapping."" ""Yeah, I can do that."" And he's kinda really taking his time, just looking at me, not saying much. I say, ""Who do you want kidnapped? Who do you want me to get?"" He says, ""Can you get that doctor for me?"" I said, ""Humberto Machain?"" MEDRANO: Humberto Alvarez Machain was the physician to the drug cartel. When the drug cartel leaders would party, they'd party hard. It's not just a three-hour party, they would party every day for a week. And it was not uncommon for someone at one of these big parties to overdose. So, they would have a physician present to assist that person. So, fast forward, Agent Camarena is kidnapped, he's put in this small room at the house at Lope de Vega. He is beaten, he is tortured. And the body can only take so much, so he would lapse into unconsciousness. Humberto Alvarez Machain was brought in and he would administer medication to Camarena to revive him so the torture could continue. BERRELLEZ: Jack Lawn asked me, ""Can you get him?"" ""Absolutely, I can get him. He's easy. Why don't we go after some bigger fish?"" He said, ""No, no, no, no, no,"" just like that. ""How would you do it?"" ""How would I do it? ""I'd hire the Mexicans to do it, ""I'd hire Comandantes to do it. ""Pay them money the way the traffickers do. ""Pay them money, they'll-- they'll-- they'll kidnap the President for the right amount of money."" ""How much would he cost?"" ""Not much. I can probably do it for about 250,000, a quarter of a million."" He said, ""Okay, do it. I want it done."" So I started calling comandantes that I know. And I know this comandante. I set up a meeting with him in El Paso, Texas. And I said ""Can you kidnap this guy for me?"" He says, ""Yeah, absolutely, I can do it."" ""Will you do it for 250,000?"" He said, ""Yeah."" About two weeks later he calls me up and he says, ""Hey,"" he says, ""You know how we're gonna get him? He likes young beautiful girls."" And I said, ""Yeah, let's do that. Hire a couple of prostitutes."" They called me and they said, ""Okay, it's all set up."" So, they cordoned off a whole block around the clinic with police roadblock. The girls went in there. When the doctor shows up, signal goes off, and they go in and take him and they put him in a hotel room. From the hotel room, they called me, and they said, ""We got him."" I says, ""Get a pilot and get him to El Paso."" So, when I get there, I go to the tower and I tell them, ""DEA, Special Operations. This plane is going to land, let him land."" And, of course FAA, ""We can't do that, and customs and anybody, we can't--"" I says, ""You're gonna do it, I don't want to hear no shit. ""This is a very special operation being planned out of headquarters, Please guys, don't give me any crap, let him land."" They said, ""Okay, okay,"" and they finally backed off. So, we're there at the airport and the plane lands. And before it even stopped, the door opens, and then I see this big fat guy being pushed out of the plane. The plane doesn't even stop. They close the gate up again and the plane takes off again. Good, south to Mexico. And this guy's laying there on the tarmac. So I walk up, got my DEA badge. ""Dr. Machain, Hector Berrellez, pleased to meet you. Get up!"" REPORTER 1: Ruben Zuno Arce, brother-in-law to former Mexican President Echeverria, was arrested as a material witness in San Antonio last week. DEA agents believe that Zuno has information about the murder. REPORTER 2: Ruben Zuno Arce has ties to the drug traffickers who tortured and killed Camarena. REPORTER 1: Attorneys for Zuno deny any drug involvement by their client. MEDRANO: Ruben Zuno Arce was the owner of Lope de Vega. We had numerous informants who described Ruben Zuno Arce as a drug dealer himself and in bed with the drug cartel. Ruben Zuno Arce was the brother-in-law of one of the former presidents of Mexico. That shows you how high the Zuno Arce tentacles reached into the Mexican government. Let there be no question about this. The evidence against Ruben Zuno Arce was overwhelming. JORDAN: You have a DEA agent, who was the supervisor of Kiki Camarena, testify in federal court that Zuno Arce was really not in the dope business. I cannot believe that right there and then-- That son of a bitch should've been out. He should not have been a DEA agent. This is Kiki Camarena's supervisor. And he testifies to the fact that Ruben Zuno is not a drug dealer. We are shocked. HOLM: He testified under oath in trial, and the assistant US attorney was just apoplectic. BERRELLEZ: After he testifies, we take a little break. While we're in the elevator, Manny Medrano, the AUSA, gets his briefcase and he slams it on the elevator floor and he says, ""Hector, take your gun out and shoot me right now. ""We're gonna lose this case! ""He's supposed to be on our side. He's Kiki's supervisor. He's gonna taint the whole jury."" Then I've got the CIA receiving money from Fonseca, and arming Fonseca and the drug lords, and using Caro Quintero's ranch. Then I've got my own government saying, ""Oh, don't report that. Don't do DEA 6s on this, that and the other."" There's layers and layers of this case. We told Hector, ""They are going to shut down your investigation..."" He says, ""Why?"" ""Because the CIA and the DEA are mixed up in this. ""They are allied with the Narcos, and with politicians, and with the Mexican government."" But Hector didn't believe us then. He told us, ""No way."" And he got very pissed off. ""No fucking way bastards, this is not Mexico! ""Whoever deserves to fall will fall. ""If the President himself was involved in this, I'm going to fuck him up myself."" I said, ""Fine, if you say so."" REPORTER: The drug war had Vice President Dan Quayle in a tense meeting today with Mexico's President Salinas. The issue, the abduction of a Mexican doctor to stand trial in the United States in connection with the torture and murder of an American drug agent. President Salinas expressed to me his strong displeasure with the Dr. Alvarez incident. There were no DEA agents in Mexico who are involved in this particular situation. REPORTER: The head of the DEA said hard feelings can be smoothed over. There will be some report forthcoming in the next couple of days that will totally resolve this matter. BERRELLEZ: Next thing I know, I'm under investigation myself. ""DEA agent, Hector Berrellez, Kidnapper."" ""Kidnapped a doctor without headquarters' knowledge or authorization. Wanted man."" I was there, I was the lead prosecutor. We did our job, we followed the rules, followed the law. So, anything that happened in this case, including kidnappings of bad guys from foreign jurisdictions, was entirely authorized by the American government. I want to be very clear about that, because that's how it all came down. REPORTER: Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain was released last week by a federal judge. After the judge's ruling, Dr. Alvarez broke down and cried. He hugged and thanked his lawyers. HOLM: Then the plane that belonged to the Mexican Attorney General flew to Los Angeles and picked up Machain and flew him back to Mexico. BERRELLEZ: He was treated like a hero. Next day was a ""David and Goliath"" story in Mexico, that he beat the case in the United States. He beat Goliath. BERRELLEZ: So, I was transferred back to Washington, DC, and was given a desk and a phone. Really no job, not a real serious job. They just said, ""This is where you're going to work in DC. ""We don't want you contacting any of your sources. No more contact with your witnesses."" So here I am. I don't know what's gonna happen to me, and I'm very fearful. I'm not fearful that the traffickers are gonna kill me, I'm fearful that my own government is gonna kill me. INTERVIEWER: Did Hector know too much? JORDAN: Yes. Hector, to this day... knows too much. BERRELLEZ: Before I left the agency, I was visited by a supposedly very high-up CIA official. And he told me, ""Hector, you see, ""the CIA is not a law enforcement agency. ""We are not bound ""by Constitutional law. ""Our job is to protect the United States from foreign enemies."" And he says, ""So listen, you be a good soldier, ""you don't want to piss off your own government. ""Just keep all this stuff about the CIA bringing in drugs, ""the CIA, you know, being complicit in Kiki's murder that you allege. ""You can't prove it anyway, so you might as well just keep it all quiet. ""Have a nice life, enjoy your retirement. ""Because, remember, if you upset this government, ""you still have that warrant in Mexico. ""You might find yourself in a Mexican prison, ""and you know you won't last a week there. ""So if I was you, mum is the word. That's all I have to say to you."" And I said, ""Thank you, have a nice day."" I felt totally betrayed by the DEA. Totally, totally betrayed. There's never been a war on drugs. It's all a fallacy. It's all a facade. Our politicians get up, ""Oh, we're gonna fight drugs, we're gonna stop the drug flows from coming into the country."" That's not true. They deal drugs themselves to support their black operations, to support their wars that are not authorized. There were many injustices done to him. I could really feel Hector's sorrow. BERRELLEZ: You miss your kids, you miss not being there for football games, school events, they sing at the-- with the choir on Christmas and you're not there. Sometimes you'll be gone seven months out of a year, and your family was by themselves in the States. And, I suffered for it later, I had one of my sons take his life. He shot himself. My son was destroyed, my poor Hector. INTERVIEWER: Do you blame yourself for that? -BERRELLEZ: I do. -INTERVIEWER: Why? Because his last words were, ""Nobody loves me."" And I felt I didn't show him enough love as a little boy. I was absent in his life too much. He was a hell of a baseball player, and I was never there for his games. INTERVIEWER: What were you saying about Camarena's ghost? Give me some time... It's just... Enrique Camarena. He represents all the spirits behind me. They are with me every day. And now I feel them, with all their energy. Here, we have him on our side. And behind him, there are some souls, grim souls... asking the Lord for divine justice. indistinct chatter MIKA CAMARENA: I want to know why our government let Kiki down. One of their best agents... and they let him down. JORDAN: He was a friend. And he was a good friend, he was a working friend, he was one of the guys that you would want on your team if you were gonna hit a house. Kiki was a Marine. And they did him. INTERVIEWER: What are you thinking? sighs Of the torture. The guy didn't have a chance. The betrayal, which makes it even harder... to comprehend. I can't believe it. I can't believe, uh, that this really, really happened. But it did. It did, it did happen. INTERVIEWER: Why are you talking now? BERRELLEZ: Well, now I'm talking because the warrant in Mexico has expired. They can't send me to Mexico any more. I'm getting older, and I've had this little thorn in my heart, knowing the truth of what really happened to Kiki. I want the world to know the truth. It's time. I don't want to carry this to the grave with me. And now, if they kill me, well, okay, I've had a great life. And they might still kill me. I am not gonna quit this, I'm gonna be on this crusade of putting out the true story 'til I die. And if I die doing it, well that's-- that's what God wanted. telephone rings ringing continues GODOY: Camarena wasn't killed by a single person. Camarena was killed by many people. He was killed by politicians, police officers, by the military, by Narcos, by the CIA. Enrique Camarena was just a fucking sacrificial goat. Just a sacrificial goat."
40,2000,Where the Money Is,American,"Professional thief Henry Manning is in an Oregon nursing home's care. Having suffered a massive stroke, he is immobile and mute. Henry is in the care of Carol Ann McKay, a high school prom queen who married her boyfriend Wayne, the star of her school's football team, and whose glamour days are well behind her.
Carol Ann starts to suspect that Henry isn't as sick as he seems. She attempts to get a rise out of him by doing a lap dance, but fails. So convinced is she that Henry is faking, she gives him the ultimate test, pushing Henry and his wheelchair off a pier into the water, defying him to swim or die.
Preferring this place to prison, Harry had studied yoga as a way to fake the symptoms of a stroke. Exposed as a fraud, Henry is at least relieved to be able to walk and talk again. Soon he is dancing and drinking with Carol Ann and Wayne at a local bar, then coaxing them to be his accomplices in his last and greatest score, an armored transport heist.

Looks like you did a lot of dancing in the joint. Those were guys. This is different. Laughs Ow. Take it easy. Are you gonna be all right? - Huh? - I'm okay. What were you talking about? What? You're jealous. Why would I be jealous? - You are. You're jealous. - No way. I mean, look at the guy. He's about to keel over. Where'd he go? Carol. Check the men's room. Oh, goddamn it! He's gone. He took the car. Oh, no. No, that's it. I'm calling the cops. - And tell them what? - Anything. We turned our backs, he was in the wheelchair, he was gone. I don't know. Oh, was that before or after I was seen dancing with him? You can't call the cops. How could you do this? You come up with these ideas and I end up having to go along. And every time, the shit hits the fan, who's gotta clean it up? Me! What are we gonna do here? What do we do? What do we do, huh? I don't know. Why don't we fix the Mustang... - and just get the hell out of here? - Yeah. - And then what? - Well, just keep going till we find someplace we like. You know what? I like it here just fine. I couldn't call earlier. I'll explain later. Hey, just come and get me and bring the money. There's a train station. It's about a mile from the home on Route 6. - Is this better?

I want you to pay special attention to her. I'm concerned. She might be a danger to herself. Okay, great. - Great? - Um... I'll take care of it. Don't worry. Sighs Why did you come back? Nobody's business. You knew I wouldn't call the cops on you, but that doesn't mean I won't sign you up for bingo. So... Why did you come back? All right. I'll do it for you. After making a complete ass of me, you went and called someone, but you couldn't reach them. No. Maybe you did reach them, and they're gonna pick you up here. I mean, you're a lot safer here than you are on the outside... with the cops looking for you, right? Or maybe... you came back because you didn't want to get me in trouble. Man ""N""43. Ah.

What, they're giving away free toaster ovens. Can you imagine what kind of moron it takes... to open a bank account in order to get a free toaster oven? - Think we could knock that place off? - Beg your pardon? Do you think we could knock that place off? - Who? - You and me. Honey, I am playing brain-dead, not brain-damaged. Tell me, how can you go from just taking care of dead people... to what I'm listening to now? - You're the one who said I needed a new town. - When? When we were dancing... and you said me and Wayne didn't make sense anymore. You wanna save your marriage by robbing a bank. Why don't you go see a priest? - That's not what I'm saying. - What are you saying? I'm saying...

You know something? - I used to be the prom queen. - Really? - I'm not surprised. - But the sad fact is, prom queen, it doesn't really prepare you for much in life. It's been kind of downhill ever since. I'm not saying I'm bitter. I'm just saying that I don't have much time. And there's only one thing that's gonna make me feel good about myself again. Toast. Uh, I'm afraid I don't understand. - Then give me a toaster oven. - Sorry, ma'am, l... I don't wanna have to get ugly on you, Farwell. Hurry. God, I need a cigarette.

A depository, Henry, where the banks bank. The only one around for a hundred miles. That's a lot of honey, honey. How's that for homework? Good on the money, not so good on the choice.

I can do whatever the hell I want! - Shh! You're gonna blow everything. - I'm gonna blow everything? What about you, the other day in your damn car? - Don't bother lying. I saw you. - Shh! We have to talk. It's not what you think, if that's what you're thinking. - Tell me about it. - Okay. - We're working together. - What are you talking about? We're doing a job together. - What job? - A bank job. You expect me to believe that? - Yes. - Okay, so you don't want to screw the old guy. You just want to rob a bank with him. No. It's just an armored car. Oh. Just one of those steel-plated trucks, bulletproof glass, a couple guys inside with shotguns, Carol?

He's just him. - Honey... - I'm gonna tell that son of a bitch... No! It was my idea. Yeah? Well, you never wanted to rob a bank until he came along. - Henry, what are you doing here? - How am I gonna run the sprinklers... - when you leave your people all over the place? - I don't know.

He saw us in the car together. I lied to him. Of course he went nuts. I mean, what if it were reversed? What if it were you and me? You would've flattened him right in his wheelchair... in the TV room, in front of all the little old ladies. You should give Wayne some credit for self-control. - Hey, don't push it. - Okay. Try this. Either he's in or I'm out. Ohh! Amateur hour. If anybody had ever told me a husband and wife amateur hour... But one thing clear. If anything goes sour, I'm gone.

Gas station. Wayne Oh, this next one's mine. That's that sports bar where they got all the sports channels. Yeah, but nobody spends any money in there. Hey, well, at least it's not a gas station.

We have our work cut out for us then, don't we? I think we should... have a little picnic for the ladies.

41,2015,We'll Never Have Paris,American,"Quinn (Simon Helberg) and Devon (Melanie Lynskey) are a couple since highschool. Quinn works in a flower shop with Kelsey (Maggie Grace) and Devon teaches in local university. Kelsey tells Quinn she is in love with him and starts flirting with him. Quinn tells Devon he wants to take a step back in the relationship, she understands it's about Kelsey, storms out and stays at her parents. Quinn goes to Kelsey's, they kiss and she gives him a handjob which ends too soon and they go to sleep. In the morning Quinn feels guilty and decides to visit Devon at her parents and propose to her. He ends up confessing what happened with Kelsey and though it's over he still works with her. Devon gets angry, says they need time separately to figure things out and maybe he should be with other girls, so it won't plague him that he only slept with her. He finds on Facebook a single schoolmate, they have a date and sleep together. He understands he wants to be with Devon and quits his job. He goes to Devon's parents only to find out she left to Paris, where they have relatives. He asks for her address to send her flowers, and shows up at her door. She tells Quinn she started dating Guillaume (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), and she doesn't want to be back with him. Quinn surprises her at her grandparents, but to his surprise Guillaume is also there. After eating, both Guillaume and Quinn play short recitals. As Quinn finishes, his left eye is very red due to a medical problem he has (Pingueculitis). Ignoring the situation he takes out the ring and gets ready to propose. Devon enters the room, but surprisingly she is accompanied by Kelsey, coming to win Quinn back. This causes Quinn to accidentally step on Guillaume's heirloom violin and he crushes it, which causes a slap fight between the two. Ashamed, Quinn leaves and returns to his home alone. Devon surprises him at his new work and he proposes in his car. Right after she says yes he tells her about the one-night stand he had. After some tense talk, and groveling on Quinn's part, Devon takes off the ring and asks Quinn to propose again.",4.6,tt3079016,"Like any organ does as we grow older, the eye deteriorates and decays. Whether it be genetic predisposition or environmental factors, we are subject to losing the gift of sight, clouding the windows to our souls, if you will. Did you know that cataracts are now responsible for 48 of world blindness? Though aging is the primary cause, there are a wide variety... Devon, you're just going to grade papers the whole time? What? This is my lunch break. What do you want me to do, pray for you? Your eye is fine, okay? Just like your teeth aren't getting looser, and you didn't have foot rot. Knock on wood. Okay. I got to get the rest of these papers to my TA. But, I love you. You're okay. - Love you. - Say hi to the doc for me. See you after work, assuming I can still see. ...to irreversible loss of vision. Quinn. - Hey there, pal. - Hi, Dad. So, what is it this time? A little redness? Yeah, just in the left eye. A little dot's been there for about a week. Okay. Let's go. Let's just lean forward. Place your chin on the plastic piece there and look directly into the light. Right here. Good. Oh, by the way, your mother made some of that egg salad that you love, you know, with the tarragon, I brought some in for you. Thanks. Well, what do you know, pingueculitis. It's an irritation or a thinning of the conjunctiva. It's usually found in elderly people, Latinos, people who work outdoors. You the outdoorsy type now? I'd go with Latino before outdoorsy. It could also have something to do with your nose. What's wrong with my nose? Nothing. It's a beautiful nose, you got the Berman nose. Only it's, slightly more pronounced than other noses might be. How does my nose size contribute to this? It's acting as a kind of... large reflector, if you will. Wait, so my nose is so large that... What, the reflection is burning a hole in my eye? No, no, no, no, no... Just the lining of it. The treatment is artificial tears and UV-protection sunglasses. - You're getting older there, my boy. - Twenty-eight's not old. Yeah. It's not really the age where it makes any sense. Nor the race. All right, I'll get your UV sunglasses. The ladies are gonna love you. Dad, I have a girlfriend for years. Kidding, I love Devon. When are you gonna propose? I was about to. I have Mama's ring. But now, with this illness... It's not an illness. It's a condition. It's treatable. Marriage, I mean. How many times a day do I have to put in the artificial tears? Six to eight. Or I could just insert some punctal plugs. - Insert where? - In your punctum. - In my what? - Tear ducts. Little, tiny, umbrella-shaped, silicon plugs that block out the drainage of tears, - thus, irrigating the eye. - I'm sorry. I'm a little... Sit, sit. Come on. Come on, sit down, sit down. That's it. Put your head between your legs. Your grandmother used to say... That means, ""You only get one first marriage."" - That's inspiring. - Look... If Devon is the one, unless there's a piece of coal in that ring, instead of a diamond, your sitting on it longer, isn't doing you any good. You saw the people in the waiting room. They were all you, yesterday. - Dev. - What? Aren't you supposed to be at work? Impersonating late Miles Davis? What happened? No, nothing. I wanted sir to prize... To precise... I wanted to surprise you. You know. Okay. Wait, what did he say about your eye? Oh, no, it's fine. Actually, it put everything into perspective. That, well, I'm finally... You know... And I love you more than... Okay, I... I... love you too. But, you're scaring me. So, there's nothing wrong with your eye? Yes, there's... No... Yes, there's... It's pingueculitis. It's not a big deal, I'm just supposed to wear those glasses but... Well, you know, I do know how seriously you take fashion. - Yeah, says the girl who only wears clogs. - What? They're comfortable. Yeah, well, that doesn't make them not clogs. Very cloggy. - What? - I mean, you're just my favorite. Well, you're up there for me too. Well... The day has come... Oh, my God. You got a gig playing piano. I... No, no... no, no. But didn't you send in your demo tape to the Thai restaurant? No one wants to hear live jazz while they're eating mee krob, it's too much. Come on, at some point you're gonna have to play in front of people. Anyway I just wanted to... - I have to go. - What? You have class. - Thank you so much for surprising me. - Okay. Okay. I'm gonna call you on the way home. I'm sorry. I'm just supposed to be giving a lecture on Flaubert. You don't have to lecture them about Flaubert. Just... say it nicely. - All right. Love you. - Love you. It's just this eye condition. - Pinga... Wait, what? - Pingueculitis. Is it... Is it contagious? No. What are we doing with the rose petals, did I miss an order? I'm... I'm... Okay, don't say anything, Kelsey. But, I'm gonna ask Devon to marry me. I mean, you know, I used to propose to girls in elementary school. I mean, I was in elementary school too. It wasn't just illegal. Yay! Yay! Yeah. Thanks. I mean, of course. I called it in high school. You did, yeah? What about you? You're still with... - We broke up. - The basketball player. - We broke up too. - Oh. But, there's a new guy, Isaac, you'll meet him tonight. We are having pizza before Jameson's, right? - Yes, yeah. And you're bringing... - Isaac. - Isaac. - Yeah, the mechanic. Cool. Well, if it doesn't work out with him I have a great mechanic. - Thanks. - Yay. - Can I talk to you for a second? - Sure. I think I might be in love with you. A little. With me? No, you're right. Never mind. No. Wait. What? I mean... Obviously, I don't want to ruin what we have here. And, I love Devon. She buys me lottery tickets on my birthday 'cause she know how much I want to win. But, it just hit me, that all these guys, I mean, they don't challenge me. And you... You make me feel like a lady. And... and you listen. And you make eye contact. Are you really gonna marry the first girl you've ever been with? Well... One girl in your entire life. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told you. Yes, you should have. But you can do better. Look at you, you're like a model. I mean, when we hug, I look like a skin tag hanging off of you. Come on, you're a man. A man? What lead you to believe that? Sorry. I can get a little rough sometimes. Sure. Me too. I'll see you tonight. Right. Tonight, yeah. I'll see you tonight. - Oh, this one? - Yeah, that one. Yeah, thanks. This is lucky seven. My mom got it for me, 'cause in my family this is like... So, what does the tattoo on your neck say? ""Veni, vidi, vici."" ""I came, I saw, I conquered."" Is it ""vici"" or ""vicky""? Vici. It's Latin, so a soft 'V'. - You got tattoos? - Me? No. Unless you count ""thug life"" scrawled across my chest. But that's henna, so... No, I was just super scared, like... He's gonna be fine. He freaks out about everything. What? I do not. Every time you sit down at the piano now you mention that your hands are shrinking. My hand span does seem smaller. Okay, and then last week you thought your hair was going white. - I found all these white hairs on my collar. - Okay, which was cat fur. - I didn't do a DNA test. - Okay, this is so ridiculous. You know what I just realized, I have never heard you play the piano. No, he doesn't play in front of anybody. If I'm gonna be heckled, I just prefer that it's by me, that's all. That's cool. I mean, it makes you all mysterious and like tortured. See... Yes, tortured. That's my wheelhouse. Oh, thank you so much. - What did you do? - How'd that happen? Dev! - Well, I am stealthy. - Well, thank you. Also, I'm sorry to just dash out on everyone, - but I think I'm gonna grab a cab home. - Why? I'm just, like, so tired. I have that thing in the morning. Can you give these guys a ride to Jameson's? - Okay. Well, I love you. - I love you. Bye. I'm probably gonna head out pretty soon, too. - I'm gonna go meet up with my boys. - Okay. I don't feel like going to this party. All right. Why don't I just go drop you back off with Isaac and his boys. Because I don't feel like getting stoned and playing foosball. You philistine. Don't call me names. Did I hurt the fragile flower? I'm sorry. Is that okay? I mean, kissing my neck is okay. It's like the same thing as hugging. - No, no, no. - What? I just really want to kiss you. Well, that would not be good. No, I know. I could show you my boobs. Okay, wait, wait. This feels rapey. Why? 'Cause you don't want to kiss me. I want to. But, I can't. Yeah. - It's not like I could be with Kelsey. - No, you couldn't. Her legs, though, Jameson, they're so long. I've never seen legs like that in person. They are freakishly long. I just... I haven't been in another relationship. And now this tall model likes me. I mean, she thinks I'm sexy. Manly. Okay, she modeled one time in a catalog for Mervyn's, and a lot of girls think you're sexy. More than think I'm sexy. Okay, first off, girls think I'm cute, not sexy. And, second of all, you're just unaware of your good looks. I wish I was unaware of my looks, I'm aware they're not good. Shit. I just lost a grand. - What kind of dealer gets every time? - A computerized one. Maybe you do need to explore... Wait a minute. I thought you wanted to marry Devon one day. I do, that's what I'm saying. It's just... Those legs... Dude, you really need to chill out. I feel like you're about to ask me to help you hide the body. I'm fine, I'm thinking clearly. I just... I have a lot of energy. I'm galvanized. Hey, check it out. I... am corning my own beef. Better to corn your own than someone else's, I guess. Okay, you're right. I need to talk to Kelsey. Just patch that up and then I... She's so sexy. No, no. See, think of it like... a wet dream, right, nothing really happened. - So to talk about it, would be awkward. - So what? Suppress my feelings? And then, by the time I examine them, they're all tainted and deformed, and then the idea of the event and the event itself would become inseparable and, therefore, impossible to analyze? I need to act now. Okay, this is not Darfur, you don't need to act now. You need to go home. You're not making sense. Hey. Imagine that was me slapping you in the face. That was. - Hey. - Still learning that same song? Yeah, I just can't seem to get past this one part. How was the faculty meeting? Hilarious. Why are you being so cold? What are you talking about? I just got back from work. I want to take a bath. We just spent the last two hours debating the plural of ""syllabus."" Sorry, I... I just wanted to ask you something. Okay, can I just run my bath first? Sure, fine. - I said, I wanted to ask you something. - Okay. But, you're in the bath. You said you were going to run it, not get in it. Yeah, who could've predicted this? What is wrong with you? Nothing. I guess I've just been feeling kind of confused recently. - About what? - I'm so immersed in everything. I can't... see clearly. Maybe, I just need to take a step back for a moment. Wait a minute. - What is happening right now? - Nothing. I don't know. Why? Are you talking about us? Not... No... I don't know... Maybe. Are you trying to break up with me? I don't even know what's happening... to me. - What are you doing? What are you doing? - I can't fucking believe this. - Devon, wait a second. - Turn around. - What? - Don't look at me, I'm getting dressed. Now, I can't see you naked? Ten seconds ago it was fine. Yeah, well, a lot's happened in the last seconds. Nothing's happened. You're overreacting. I don't even know what I'm saying right now. Who is it? - Who is what? - It's always someone else. What? The only girls I know are you and Kelsey. And I'm with you, and Kelsey is like a model... No, I didn't mean that. I do hear how that sounded. - Devon, what are you doing? - Do you like Kelsey? Do I... No. Not like that. I swear. Wait... There's nothing that you did. My head is just spinning... Maybe I need to gain some sort of perspective, or objectivity for a second before... What are you doing? Don't touch me! I'm gonna stay somewhere else tonight. Look, if you don't want to see me, I can go somewhere. No, I'm going, you stay here. - Where are you gonna go? - I don't know, to my parents'. - With wet hair? You'll get pneumonia. - Oh, please. - Fuck. - I know. No. Thought I lost a piece. Maybe you're not really ready to get married, dude, I mean, obviously your brain is trying to tell you something. No, I want to marry Devon. I think. I've just been so comfortable with her for so long. I can't tell. It's easier to feel when you're in pain. I guess I just... fear that I've been confusing complacency with happiness. I'm already 28, it's just going to start flying by. I want to feel like a man. I want to experience crazy romance and pining and jealousy. And whirlwind affairs in foreign countries. Hey, check it out. It's a Middle Eastern man on the camel. They make those? Well, I did have to special order it, but, yeah. Okay, I'm gonna go now. Hey, man. Hey. Are you doing all right? No, I just explained that, while you were building a scene from Aladdin. - No. Look, I'm here for you. - Okay, thank you, I need to go. - Home? - Yes, home. - No proposing? - None. - No Kelsey. - No. - I hope I was able to help. - Yeah. Are you thinking about Devon? I don't even feel bad though. Maybe I'm a sociopath. I guess we're allowed to kiss now. That is so romantic. Do you think maybe we should get ready for bed? Yeah. I mean, I'm ready, but... okay. Okay. I don't really know how to ramp up to where we were before. - Do you want to talk to me? - Sure. About what? No, like dirty. I'm good. I don't really have anything to say dirtily. - Okay. - Why? Did you want me to talk to you? - No. No, I mean, if you wanted to. - Do you want to talk to me like that? - Sure. Yeah, that could be fun. - Okay. Yeah. Go for it. Whenever you're ready or take your time. Let me just set the mood. Okay, so... - Take out your cock. - I haven't put it in yet. No, not out of... Never mind. Okay, yes. Yes, ma'am. Or do you want me to address you as something? No. This is not that. You know, forget it. No, hey, I'm taking out my cock. Give me that thing. - What? - Nothing. I'm sorry. Your hand is cold. That feels so good, Kelsey. Keep going. Thanks, Quinn. Yeah, that does feel good. Keep going. Do it faster, Kelsey. Do it. Whatever you say, Quinn. Sorry, this is making me a little uncomfortable. I feel like I'm in a threesome with two of me. - Wait. - What? 'Cause my hand feels too good on your cock? I don't think I'm gonna last. - Why, 'cause it feels too good? - Yes, it feels good. Sorry, I didn't make it, Kelsey. - That's okay. I'm flattered. - Who are you? What is that? - Hi. - Hi, hey. So the toilet is broken. So I hope you can wait to go to the bathroom. Sure. I was thinking maybe we could get brunch and go to the beach. What do you think? The beach. Wow. They still have sand at those things? 'Cause I always found that to be the one flaw with beaches. Come on. Get up. Okay, you get ready, and I... before we go, I have to stop at my landlord's because I lost my checkbook again. - And the toilet is... - Okay. What is this? It's a face scrubber. It's for Edward James Olmos? Jesus! Oh, my God! Perhaps a sacrificial offering. You building a pipe organ? You like my new lipstick? It's called creamsicle. What's wrong? Is it something with the toilet? Quinn? Are you okay, boo? - ""Boo""? - Yeah. I can't, I can't. - You can't what? - I can't go to the beach. - I don't feel well. - What do you want? I want to go home. I need to go rest. - Okay. - Are you angry? Yeah, a little. Kel, I'm sorry. I just... need to go home for a minute. Okay. I'm sorry. Oh, no. Oh, my God. Please, God, forgive me. I'm sorry. Help me live with this guilt or help me get past it. I think I had to do this with Kelsey to better my relationship with Devon. Amen. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, you. Wait. My bush! It's for love, man. Crime of passion. What a lucky girl. Devon. What? What are you doing here? - Are your parents here? - No. Oh, my God! I picked this flower from that angry man's garden. Did you come from somewhere? Did you come from 1973? No. I just wanted to look nice for you. And you come bearing a rose that you picked. What do you think I am, a florist? So you started smoking? Starting is the hardest part. So what made you decide to do this? I realized... that I couldn't run away from you and everything else. The problem existed somewhere in me and my fears of moving forward. And you're not feeling curious about other people? I was, maybe. I don't know. I think it was just that moment, you know, when you either turn away or go deeper. Yeah. I did think I had feelings for Kelsey. Yeah, I knew it. - Did anything happen? - No. We kissed last night, and then we did a couple other things too. - Did you sleep with her? - No. It was... stupid, but I'm just happy that it's over and... I mean, it'll be a little uncomfortable with her at work now, but... Are you kidding me? - What? - You're gonna keep working with her? I need a job, and honestly, she's just a friend. You are a fucking weaselly fuck! No! - What? - No! - Hey. - Everything all right? It's fine, Kurt. Can you just, please... You didn't tell me your brother was home. I tried calling you, man... He's my brother. You don't get to call him right now. And you know what? You're right. We have problems that we need to figure out separately. - You're not ready. - No. Wait. And maybe you should go be with other girls. Otherwise, it's always going to be plaguing you. I'm not plagued. Besides, what girls would I... Oh, I'm sorry. Let me go and find some girls for you to fuck. Devon, that's not what I meant. - I just don't know anybody. - Just leave. So now you've got to go bone a bunch of other girls. - I guess. - And Devon's all right with this? She told me I had to. - Kelsey keeps calling, texting. - See? You're magnetic. Okay, so I'll do that with the boning. Take a moment. Then I'll see what the deal is with Devon. I don't know. I mean, right now, I have to get it out of my system, like a poison. - Very romantic. - It's not supposed to be romantic. I need to be a guy, a guy who fucks girls. I need to fucking fuck. I still don't think you should be with anybody right now. Maybe we should have a party here or something. No. My parents are coming back from the Dutch house in a couple months. A couple months... I'm not looking to remodel. Look, you just need to clear your head for a moment. Why don't we go somewhere? Like out of town. Like... We'll forget about girls. Yes, thank you. That is what I'm saying. Great. Yeah, we'll just go be guys. - We'll go be fucking guys. - Yes. This is Fresh Air. I'm Terry Gross. The fear of ticks is taking some of the pleasure out of walking in the woods... You ever send a check to them, NPR? Yeah, all the time. Yeah, I gotta do that. See, those are the kinda things, you know, when you're in a relationship, that just get... swept under the rug. - I miss Devon. - No. Yes, dude. I think I got it out of my system, you know, with this and the surrey and the weird little horse. - Dude, you have to take time. - You know, her brother won't call me back? - What? You called Kurt? - Here you go. I left him a couple messages just saying I hope we can still hang out and be friends. - Dude, that is her brother. - But he's my friend. - And it's been, like, two days. - Preemptive. Oh, my God. Quinn, listen. You really have to chill out, you maniac. You have to be alone. Don't see anybody. Just take a deep breath. And enjoy this freedom. What do I do? What do people do? Single. Pennsylvania, ranch, family... Beach. Okay. All right. All right. Shit! - Quinn. - Hi. - Hi. - Hey. Pull up a saddle. Howdy. The last time I was in a saddle was on a horse at summer camp. I had an anxiety attack and woke up in the cantor's office. No pun intended. Cantor... See, if they would just put an Ethiopian restaurant in Ethiopia, it would solve a lot of problems. - Sorry, I'm nervous. - Yeah, yeah. I am now too. So you like the beach? The beach? Yeah, well, I saw on... On what? I saw on... on Facebook. Did I, like, write that somewhere or something? No, no. - Do you know what you're getting? - No. Sorry. I didn't follow you here. - I just need a moment. - Kelsey. This isn't me. I don't do these kind of things. Sorry. This is... I'm the girl Quinn left his girlfriend for. And you must be the girl he left his girlfriend for the second time after he left me for his girlfriend. No. Excuse me. What is going on? How did you know I'd be here? - Facebook. - That was a private message. - You're so non-savvy with computers. - My ineptitude does not make this okay. Look, I've been thinking, and I think you made a mistake. I mean, that we made a mistake because this is not rotten at the core, like there were symptoms of something gone awry that we were ignoring. And I think that if we were just really honest... Calm down. I'm just trying to cool off for a moment. I don't want to see anyone right now. She's nobody. I'm not seeing her. Maybe you need to get your eyes checked again because I see the fuck out of her. You need to grow up. I'm sorry. I don't even know what to say. You can leave now. I'm not this kind of guy, juggling women. Okay. I think it's out of my system. What? What? What's out of your system? What are you talking about? You just said this is out of your system. What is out of your system? You're a pint-sized narcissist! And I could barely feel you inside me! - You sure you got it out of your system? - Yes. It was never in my system to begin with. Try... this. I quit my job this morning which is a big step. Yeah, you made a pledge to NPR, you went on one date, and now you're unemployed. I'd call that personal growth. Yes. I've matured. You sure you want Devon? That's all I've ever wanted. Cheers to that, man. And it's been good having you around again. Cheers, man. It's spicy. No, it's good... Good spice. It's painful. I call it the Oaxacan dirty bomb. It's pleasant though, right? Just like the name suggests. It's made with real habanero chilies that I cultivated hydroponically. - I'm gonna go get Devon back. - What about your drink? Hi, Jean. Is Devon here? No. Okay. Is Devon here? No. Is she here though? What the fuck are you doing, Quinn? This isn't Anne Frank. She's not here. What do you want? I want to be back with her. I was an idiot. I know it now, and... I need her. I'm falling apart. Hey, man. Quinn, I thought when I saw you again, I would slap you till you had to have your jaw wired shut. But I look at you now and you're like a poor, pathetic, wounded gazelle. Thank you. She's gone. - Devon? - She left last week. - Where? - Paris. We have family there. She got a place. She's gonna take a semester off from the university, find herself. Well, how long is she gonna be there? I can't get in the middle of this. Hello. Hi. Hi. I'm so sorry that I showed up at the Ethiopian place. No. It's fine. What are you doing? Honestly, trying to figure out Devon's exact location in Paris so I can chase her down. Didn't she send flowers through the shop to her, like, grandparents in France? Their address is probably in the database. She's not staying with them. They don't speak English. Well, I really just wanted to say I was sorry for being a total idiot. No. Sometimes the healthiest thing we can do is make a fool of ourself. - Yes, Quinn. - Hi. Hey, Kurt. Listen, I want to send her flowers. A housewarming gift. You gotta let me do that. Please. I'm an ex-florist, okay? I know what flowers she wants, what she needs. Can I just have her address? I mean, come on, what am I gonna do? What? Quinn. Oh, my God! You're... You're here. - I am. - Okay. Okay. - Come on in. - All right. You sure or... Yeah. I mean, I assume that's why you're in Paris, - at my door, with a suitcase. - Yeah. I mean, if it's a bad time or... - Come in. - Okay. How did you know where I was? I have my ways. - This is beautiful, nice. - Thanks. Yeah. Thanks. I brought you something. Right. - Clogs. - Yeah. - They're handmade, in America. - Thanks. How did you find this place? Well, a couple who are friends of my mom's... It's their son's. Yeah. - Is he here? - No, no. He was when I got here, but he is staying in Provence with his family now. I actually went down there for a couple of days to stay with his family and him. - Yeah? - Yeah. What is he... What does he do, this son? How old is he? He is 32. He's a classical violinist. He tours around with his dad. It's funny, I just watched 400 Blows. Yeah? Well, I'm just saying 'cause it's French and all, and here we are. It's... coincidence. Did he play for you? - Did who... - The kid. Guillaume. Yeah. - Is he okay or... - He was amazing. - What did he play? - Oh, gee, I think he played some Mozart. Mozart it's... yeah, it's pretty music. It's interesting 'cause it's not as technically challenging as other composers, you know, Bach and... - It sounded nice. - No. That's the thing. It does, you know. Even though it's easier. So how long are... When are you supposed to go back? How long are you here for? Oh, I can't remember. I have to check the ticket. It's flexible. I mean... Yeah. What is happening? Do you not want me here? No, it's not that. I... I'm sorry, it's just... Jesus Christ! I was not expecting this. Yeah, because it was a surprise. I'm here in Paris to win you back. This was supposed to be my time to... - Find yourself, I know. - Yeah. Well, I came to tell you that you can stop looking because you're perfect the way you are. You know, this has brought up a lot of issues for me too. And... I just don't know if you're ready to be with me. I am. I, you know, explored and grew... I may need to do that too. Is there... Did you meet someone or something? Wait, you met some fucking guy named Guillaume? In like the last week? What happened? Are you with him now? You don't even know him. - This is bullshit. - It's not bullshit. So what? It's real love? Okay. Sorry, I forgot running off to Paris. The odds are that within the first week, you'll meet the man of your dreams. The world according to Nancy Meyers. It has nothing to do with getting back at me. You weren't even supposed to be here. How is this about you right now? And don't judge my feelings or romances. You thought you're in love with some wannabe model. She modelled once for Mervyn's. And my feelings were misguided and I am now mature enough to see that. Are you? - Have you slept with him? - No. - But you stayed with him in Prussia or... - Provence. - Whatever and you didn't sleep with him? - No. - Did you kiss him? - Quinn... You know what, I don't even want to know. Where are you going? You don't even know your way back home and you grew up there. Maybe we should phone Guillaume at his country house and ask him for directions to see if he has any recommendations for city hotspots. I'm sure he could tell us where the Fitzgeralds, or Hemingway used to smoke opium or whatever. What? No, it's just... F. Scott Fitzgerald actually lived in their house in Provence for a while. Well, that is most fucking amusing. Merci. You don't smoke. Starting is the hardest part, ma cherie. Gauloises. It'll put hair on your chest. I preferred your chest the way it was. One, two, three. If I spit it in the water, will it come back to life? No, no, no, we can't do it on his bed. What? Okay, okay. - This is only good if you have scoliosis. - Yeah, this is not the greatest. Oh, my God, that's like a Danish deco, like really expensive. - How about this thing? - This thing, it's like a Napoleon era... - I don't give a shit. Just, here. - I do, I'm sorry. I'm a guest. Okay. Just be careful. It's like a Franco-Prussian teacup. - What, are you his fucking curator? - Sorry, kind of. Kind of. - Good morning. - Hi. Sleep good? So I was thinking, we should call the airline and try to get tickets to go home today or tonight. What? Or tomorrow. Devon. Fuck it! I'm going to enjoy Paris. I'm not going to let some fucking cultural attache, or whatever he is, ruin my time here. You want to sip dandelion wine in the country and rave about socialism and eat whelks and winkles and suck the meat out of a cockle, go ahead. Move to France, why not? Yeah, but... I'm on vacation. So I'll see you when I see you. And right now... I'm in the mood for a crepe. I'm sorry. Wouldn't want to embarrass you by crying in a fucking graveyard. Why him? It's not that I want to be with him. It's just opened my eyes, you know? He... He's older, he cooks. He and his dad played sonatas for me in their living room. We talked about art and politics and... He loves Flaubert. His family's just very passionate about real stuff and... we just connected. So he cooks. I'm sorry, I don't cook. My family ordered in a lot when I was kid. I think I'd like to be buried here. Today, if possible. It must have been a bad crepe, I've never had the dry heaves before. Yeah, it was incredibly anti-climactic. What are you doing? I have a lunch in about an hour. A lunch? With who? My grandparents. I've never met them. I'm going alone, Quinn. - I'm not invited? - Quinn... I flew all the way out here to be with you and you just sleep with me like I'm some kind of boy-toy and... Okay, first of all, I didn't ask you to come out here. No, you couldn't do that because you don't know what you want. So you're just stringing me along? Yeah, right, okay. You're the victim. You're the martyr. Did you pack your crucifix or did they let you carry it on? Baby Jesus. I am not martyring myself. - Do you know how selfish this is of you? - Of me? You live your life like it's going to be brilliant when it really counts. Well, it is passing you by. Look at your music. How can you be a musician when you're too afraid to play in front of anyone? I'm a perfectionist. And I told you my hand span... Shut the fuck up about your goddamned hand span. You're just mascarading as this sensitive, magnanimous, self-deprecating person. Your idea of self-deprecation is everybody else's definition of narcissism. Well... I know you came here to bring me back with you. But I don't want to go back, I want to move forward. I feel like I'm just... looking for the name of the disease that makes me make sense. How do I be a man? Hello, hello. Hi! You do speak a little English. - Hello, hello. - Okay. Sorry, I'm late. I couldn't find the address, but then I did. - Quinn... - Devon, please. Look, I've been trying to ask you something. - Quinn, this is Guillaume. - Quinn... I didn't know you were joining us for lunch, pal. Super. I'm Guillaume. So nice to meet you. I thought you were French. Oh, yeah, well, my father's French. Yeah, just like Devon. I'll go fetch you a plate. What is he doing here? And why's he being so fucking nice to me? Yeah, what an asshole. He says, he's sorry that they only have a footstool for you to sit on. No, no, no. It's my favorite kind of stool. Yeah, speaking with a French accent isn't going to help him understand you. He wants you to have an aperitif with him. I just had a crepe... Okay. It's Pernod. He says, he's been drinking it since he was a baby. - What's in it? - It's derived from licorice. It's a successor of absinthe, relative of ouzo in Greece. That does put it in many contexts for me. She got sushi for me because she knows I like it. They're saying, you have a French face. Thank you. It's awkward, because I have an Algerian neck. So they're always fighting. They're not going to get it, also it's offensive. - Don't edit my jokes. - Fine. - See. - The timing wasn't... I thought it was very funny. She says, she knows you weren't originally going to come out to Paris. What changed your mind? I... realized I couldn't be without Devon. I want to wake up early just so I can spend more time with her. When I'm around her, the rhythm of... my breathing... literally changes. I need her. That's why I'm here. What did she say? She wants to know if anyone wants cheese? Bravo. Mozart? - A genius. - Yeah. Second concerto, right? Yeah. Hey, how about that. Are you a fan? More familiar with jazz but yeah. You see, jazz... It all sounds the same to me, no? Guillaume, what was the story you told me about your violin? Not much of a story. But... Yes, this is a Jean Baptiste Vuillaume. There was perhaps 3,000 of them made. This instrument probably costs somewhere in neighborhood of 250,000. If you can put a price on it. It seems unusually small, no? This is my baby. My godfather is Pierre Boulez. A famous conductor. And he gave this violin to my father when he was first chair for the Orchestre de Paris. One of my favorite orchestres. You know, Quinn, Flaubert said, ""Human speech is a cracked kettle ""upon which we tap crude rhythms for the bears to dance to, ""while we long to make music to melt the stars."" - Quinn plays the piano. - Yeah, I do. - Dev, can I ask you something? - Oh, yeah? That's so neat. You going to play for us? Sure. I've never played a Bluthner before. But I'll give it a shot. You finished learning it. Oh, my God. Quinn, your eye is insanely red. What? What? It must be the... - What is it? - Pingueculitis. I don't know how to say it in French. I can barely say it in English. Let me get you a warm washcloth or something. Okay, excusez-moi. Excusez-moi. - Quinn. - I'm in here. - Hi. - What the fuck? Boy, your eye looks crazo. What? What are you doing here? The address in the database, remember? - Okay, this is awkward. - No shit. This is not okay. I am making a fool of myself just like you said. No. No, no, no. I... Thank you for coming all the way out here for me, Kelsey. Quinn... Stop talking to me as me. That's insane that you do that. I don't feel that way about you, Kelsey. Jesus, I'm sorry. I... I was actually... No, no, no. No prostituée. A friend. A comrade. My Vuillaume. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Jameson, pick up. Fuck! Hello. Kurt, don't hang up. Please. I'm in trouble. - You're in trouble? - Yes. I mean, not physically. Although, kind of. All right. I want your sister back. I'm in Paris and I need her. I want to marry her. She's about to go to Provence, with some French tool. Dude, I'm in the middle of a job interview right now. - Kurt, please! You're my friend. - You want her? Because if you hurt her again, I will destroy you. I know. I won't, I promise. Okay. All right. You listen very carefully, okay? And I'm not just saying this because I know my sister, I'm saying this because I know women. If you tell her, she can't see him. She will see him. And she will fuck him... tonight. - Man, I don't know. - She will fuck him. Well, what do I do then? Hello? Hello? Kurt, hello? Shit. Hi. I have caused quite a... tumult... here today. You want to translate that or they'll get the gist? Or you can recap. Anyhow, I am sorry to everyone. I hope to make it up and repay you all... emotionally. I did this in a clumsy attempt to win you back, Devon. I apologize for the carnage that has accrued along the way. Needless to say, I'll be going home now. I love you, Devon. I hope you can remember that. Sorry. Excusez-moi. Like any organ does as we grow older, the eye deteriorates... My baby boy. So Paris was what? All right? It was... I don't want to say epically emasculating on a trans-continental level. But... - No, actually I do. - Yeah, it's hard being a man? And the hardest part is that it becomes less acceptable to be a boy. Do you love her? Devon? I love her so much. But I screwed up. How did you know where I was? I have my ways. I heard you were coming back tomorrow. I wanted to surprise you. - Pretty sweet gig. - Yeah. They pay me in pad see ew, but... You know, I could stay with Jameson tonight if you want some space. Quinn... I came back for you. Really? - I missed you. - There is a ring in my trunk. - What? - I have something in my trunk that I wanted to give you just at some point. What? What is it? Did you say a ring? A ring? Yeah. Are you... are you proposing to me? Hang on. Here. What is this? I guess, I guess... I'm asking you to... - marry me. - You guess? No. No, no, no. I am. I... I am. - Here. - Okay. Sorry. Devon, will you marry me? Oh, my God, yes. - Yes? - Yeah. I will. I can't believe you did this. I can't either. - I wanted it to be more romantic. But... - No. I just couldn't wait. I couldn't wait. I love you. I love you. There's one last thing I should probably tell you. What? I slept with someone while we were apart and I told you I hadn't seen anybody. And that happened, but we weren't together. You didn't even know her. It was just purely me trying to get it out of my system. Like you said, I didn't even like it. I just... wanted to have a clean slate before we get married and that's that. So... Are you mad? You don't want to... I'm sorry. You okay? How could you? How could you ruin this moment for me? I'm not even upset about the other part, but... I can't tell my friends, my parents this story. Sure, you can. You can leave this part out. Just not even excited anymore. I'm not happy. And it's fucking September 11th. Shit, is that today? I didn't realize. Well, we'll never forget. But we can just get past this. I mean, we're still going to get married. I don't want to talk about it right now. You're not considering not... marrying me, are you? I don't want to talk about it. But I... I... I made a mistake. I was just trying to be honest with you, for us. Not for me. I swear. I've been dreaming about how I was going to propose to my girlfriend since third grade. This was not what it looked like. Fuck. Fuck. I ruined it. I fucked this up. You're the love of my life. I fucked this up. I've ruined your moment too. Please, just say yes. Call people. Enjoy this. I'll do anything. Just come back outside. I'll propose again. Please, just switch your brain off. It's willpower. Please! I'm sorry! Please say yes. Say yes! - Please! Please say yes! - Okay, okay. Okay? Okay. Okay. What the fuck is that? - The net didn't open. - What? The plan was to propose when you got back. And if you said yes, I was going to pull this string. I didn't have time to test it. It's filled with rose petals, but... I guess, I rigged it wrong. That's a good thing that you didn't propose to me here. It would've been a total disaster. Hey. You want to try again?"
42,2009,The Informers,American,"The movie opens in 1983 at an elegant Los Angeles party at a mansion. Bruce (Fernando Consagra) wanders away from the party and is killed by a speeding car. After the funeral, his friends Graham, Martin and Tim sit drinking with Raymond on a fancy hotel patio. Only Raymond is truly devastated and cries bitterly. The friends dismiss Raymond's tears. When Raymond leaves, Graham follows him.
Graham Sloan (Jon Foster) is the son of a rich, estranged couple and drives a Porsche, stays in glamorous hotel rooms, and is a drug dealer. His father William (Billy Bob Thornton) is a movie producer with a pill-addled wife (Kim Basinger). William is having an affair with a local TV anchorwoman, Cheryl Moore (Winona Ryder). His wife, meanwhile, is having sex with her son's friend Martin (Austin Nichols). Graham is aware that his girlfriend Christie (Amber Heard) is cheating on him with a number of men, including his best friend Martin, a bisexual rock video producer. Since Graham and Martin are also sleeping together, Graham appears to be trying to accept the open relationship.
A new wave rock singer named Bryan Metro (Mel Raido) flies into L.A. He stumbles through his fancy hotel room and has sex with young groupies. Getting out of the bath, he slips on the wet floor and slashes open his hand. He answers the phone, and he is berated by his manager for sleeping with underage groupies, and he mumbles that he needs a doctor. Later, he is taken to meet a movie producer who hopes to make a profitable B-movie starring the singer. The singer appears to be barely coherent, and his attention is only caught when he sees a young girl wearing braces watching TV in an adjoining room. Bryan staggers towards her and takes her into a bedroom. Later, he stumbles into a hotel room and finds a groupie in his bed. Slurring his words, he asks her to come closer, and he kisses her, and then punches her in the face.
Jack (Brad Renfro), a hotel doorman in Christie's place, has come to seek his fortune in L.A. as an actor. He is making a humble living working as a doorman and lives in a small, run-down house. He is alarmed when he gets a phone call from his grizzled uncle Peter (Mickey Rourke), a drifter ex-con who claims he needs a place to stay. Jack angrily refuses the request, because he wants to leave the immoral, criminal side of his family background behind him. However, when Jack returns home, his uncle is waiting for him in a beaten-up van. To Jack's horror, his uncle is involved in a gangland kidnapping-for-hire plot, and the uncle has brought a kidnapped child to Jack's house. When a cleanly dressed, yet menacing gangster calls on Jack when the uncle is out, and asks to collect the ""package"", Jack feigns ignorance. When the uncle returns he tells Jack that the boy has to be killed, on the grounds that it will be more humane than what the gangsters will do to him, Jack offers to kill the boy. Instead of slitting the boy's throat, Jack pretends to kill the boy but actually releases him. Jack hides his failure to kill the boy by cutting open his hand and smearing blood on his hands and face, and he joins his uncle in the van and flees the scene.
Tim Price (Lou Taylor Pucci) is pressured to go with his father, Les (Chris Isaak), on a trip to Hawaii, ostensibly for the two to share father-son bonding time. They go to a bar, where Les starts a chat with two young women, who may be willing to have sex with them. However, Tim is not interested, and he is disgusted by his father's drunken, leering passes at the women. Tim does later find a girl he likes at the beach, but when the three of them have dinner together, Les begins to make passes at her and then both the father and the young woman make fun of Tim by suggesting that gay men were making passes at him on the beach. Tim leaves the dinner and goes out to be alone. When his father finds him, Tim refuses to talk, saying he has nothing to say.
Graham confronts Martin about Christie and asks Martin if he has been sleeping with her, apart from group sex. Martin denies betraying Graham and is shocked to realize that his friend has developed feelings for her; in their social scene, most interactions are fleeting couplings based on desire, not relationships based on caring. Graham then tells Martin that he feels adrift in his life, as if he does not have anyone who can tell him what is right or wrong. His whole life has become a series of casual encounters and light banter, which is covered over by a pharmaceutical haze. Graham seems to be making the first steps to moving away from his alienated, narcissistic lifestyle. When one of Martin's lovers calls Graham to tell him that Christie has become ill and is lying out on the sand, he drives over to the house to see her. Even though he sees that she has developed lesions, presumably AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma, all over her dying body, he seems unable to take care of her and take her to a hospital. Instead, he kisses her once, and leaves her lying on a towel on the beach dying, alone on an empty stretch of sand.",4.9,tt0865554,"What the fuck? Tell me something, Roger. Set your watch back. There's a time difference. We're landing in Los Angeles. It's a city in California. Anything else you want to know? You all right, Bryan? You on edge? Want a Valium? Lude? Gum? I used to live here, didn't l? What did he call it? A talking tomato? It's a fucking extraterrestrial, Ron. So you're telling me that he's not gonna sign off until we redesign the talking tomato? Well, that's bullshit. Ron, listen, listen to me. Let me inform you of something, okay? We don't let 25- year- olds tell us how to make movies. Listen, I gotta go. I gotta go, Ron. Just call... Ron, call me later, okay? Fast- acting Power Soap really gets in and blasts stains, Ieaving your whole wash fresh and clean, with a brightness that people will really notice. Wow! That's incredible. I thought that ketchup stain would never come out of Joe's polo shirt. Whites simply come out whiter and colors simply come out brighter. It's the kind of clean that people will really notice and talk about. How did you lift those coffee stains? I thought I was gonna have to throw my new pantsuit out. I blasted it out with Power Soap! ...and lets you get on with your day. President and Mrs. Reagan visited the grieving families and bereaved widows of the more than Marines killed last Sunday in Beirut.

Look, you want to know why you're not welcome at my house? Because you're fucked up! That's not a good enough reason. That's not even a reason. That's just one person's opinion. Look, I don't even want to fucking deal with you right now, do you understand me? Listen, I'm calling you from a payphone outside of Barstow, and I ain't got any more quarters. It's simple. Me and the Indian need a place to hang out for a couple of days. We have a plan. I don't want to hear about your fucking plan, Peter. It doesn't involve you, so stop pissing yourself. When you lose a child, you can't help but wonder what that child's life would have been like. You can't help but imagine his future. A future that now doesn't exist. But Bruce lived a full life, and there's some comfort in that. And that he was a good boy, and that he had done all the things he had ever wanted to do. That the privilege and freedom that was granted to him during his brief time in this world were what made him happy. I tell myself that I can only cherish one fact. He had everything. And now, in conclusion, I'm going to play Bruce's favorite song. It meant a lot to him. - Hi. - Hi. So I made the reservations for 8:30. - Where? - Spago. Okay. Did you tell Susan and Graham? Well, no. I thought it was just gonna be the two of us. William, I'm not really comfortable with that right now. Okay. Well, I'll call them and tell them to join us, then. - Or you could call them. - No. No, you should do that. Okay. What the fuck was with that favorite song, man? Bruce had shitty taste in music, but no way. Personally, I think his mom just liked it. The real question is, what in the hell are my mom and dad doing by the sushi bar? I mean, they're actually talking to each other. At least your mom and dad are talking. My mom gets to talk to my dad through his lawyers. Guess what? I get to go to Hawaii with the asshole. I can't fucking believe this shit. I can't believe you guys are acting this way. Acting? What way, Ray- Ray? Don't tell me he's gonna cry again. Fuck! Face it. Bruce was a jerk. Okay? He's dead. It's over. Let's not fucking dwell on it. I can't believe you guys don't fucking give a shit. You seem like you don't give a shit. Look, Raymond, there's nothing we can do, okay? It happened. It's over. It's time to move on. He's right, Raymond. It's already been a week. Okay. Bruce... Bruce was a... A cool guy. What else can I tell you, Raymond? I'm sorry it happened. ""Bruce was a cool guy""? Really, Graham? Okay, what does that even mean, ""Cool""? Especially after that shit he pulled with Christie. - Martin, what the fuck are you doing? - What shit did he pull with Christie? - Martin. - Bruce was fucking her behind your back. What, like, you all knew about this? Graham, you always say that you're not that serious about Christie. And it's not like you haven't fucked around. You know, you're never gonna win Boyfriend of the Year. - She's my girlfriend, Martin. - Look, who even knows if it's true? It's just something Bruce told us and that he bragged about. Hey, does anybody want to go to a movie? Sure, what's playing? I can't believe you guys are gonna go see a fucking movie. What the... I can't believe you don't give a shit, man. - I was there, you asshole. - Hey, come on! I watched him fucking bleed to death just like you did, so don't give me this shit about how I don't care. I had his blood all over my face. Fuck. Someone should go talk to him. Tim, Bruce thought Raymond was an asshole. He fucking loathed the dude, okay? And what the fuck does it even matter? We're having a fucking wake at the Beverly Hilton. I mean, come on, do you get it? Come on. Get up. Bruce wouldn't want to see you like this. He was my friend, right? Yeah. He was your friend. Are you lying to me, Graham? No. I'm telling you the truth. How's work? It's good. I have a full slate of movies that are testing really high. - There's one you might really like. - Yeah? What's that? It's a movie about this 12- year- old boy who becomes the president. The president of what? The United States. Sounds better than the one about the talking car. How's Graham? Well, you know your brother. He's a little hard to reach. But I'm sure he's upset about his friend's death, so, you know, it's tough. When I saw him at the memorial, he seemed fine, though. He seemed fine at Bruce's memorial? Yeah. So how's Cheryl, by the way? I'm not seeing Cheryl anymore. What? When did this happen? That's something I wanted to talk to you about, actually. - You talk to your mom lately? - We talk. You know, when she's coherent, which is rarely. Why? Well, Mom and l are moving back in together. We're going to live together again. She didn't tell me that. - How do you feel about that? - Great. Great. This is a really good move. Yeah. Really good. Seriously? I mean, you really think it's great? Well, to be honest, it hasn't totally hit me that you might actually be serious. I'm serious. We're going to be a family again. Graham and I aren't moving back in, Dad. We're not gonna be a family. You and Mom are gonna be a couple again, but we're not gonna be a family. Martin? You can't call the house anymore. Why? Is there someone here who cares? You just can't come over here anymore. - No. - Are you going to tell me why? William is moving back in. Are you telling me he dumped the newscaster chick? So... Big Bad William is moving back in. So the fuck what? Unless you wanna shell out for a room at the Bel- Air... No, Martin. Martin, you don't understand. We can't do this anymore. We can't do it. It's over. Right. Just like it was over the last time? Martin, don't. Baby. I see. Well, could I at least borrow bucks? I have to pay this guy for these Billy ldol tickets. And I forgot to go to the lnsta- Teller and, you know... You know, it's just really a massive hassle, so... What can I do for you, Mr. Metro? Can you just get these kids out of here, man? - Hey! What are you doing? Come on. - All right. Time to go. No! Hey, Jackson. How's it hanging? What the fuck are you doing here? I told you I was coming. What'd you think, it was a joke? One fucking night. And that's it. You understand me? Jackson, will you chill out, man, and show your Uncle Pete a little love, huh? Well, where's this fucking lndian friend of yours? Indian's in the desert. What the fuck does that even mean, ""The lndian's in the desert""? Indian did some bad stuff. Decided to stay in Barstow. He's laying low, if you get my drift. But Mary's in the van. - Who's Mary? - Come on, I'll show you. Jackson, this is Mary. Mary? Mary, this is Jackson. Is she okay? Yeah, she's sort of just taking it all in. She saw some stuff. Bothered her. - How old is this girl? - I don't know. Sixteen. Seventeen. I never ask. Lucifer? What the fuck are you doing with two underage kids? How many times are we gonna go through this? It does not matter if it was consensual. I fucked up my hand. How'd you do it? Did someone help you? I did it shaving, man. Who the fuck cares? My hand is fucked up. Just... Just call a doctor, Roger. We are meeting Gary Gray, the movie producer. You know, I don't know if I'm going to be able to make that meeting, Roger. Look, I'll send the hotel doctor up and then you're gonna pull it together. And when I knock on your door, you are going to answer it without your cock hanging out of some 14- year- old girl's ass. Got it? And you're going to be wearing something with long sleeves. - Why? - Multiple choice. A, you look nice in long sleeves. B, you have holes in your arms. C, you have holes in your arms. Or D, you have holes in your arms. - C. - Really? Yeah? Graham, it's for you. - It's Dirk. - Shit. Hey, Dirk. Yeah. What do you need? Yeah, I can get that for you. Okay. A little business? Yeah. And my fucking car's at my mom's. - Can you give me a ride? - Can't. I'm going to Hawaii. Well, fuck, dude, give me a better excuse than that. I wish I could. Thanks. Aloha. Can you give me a lift? Don't look at me, dude. Bye. So how're you doing, Tim? I'm good. Fine. How are you? I'm doing good, I guess. - You want a drink? - No, that's all right. Come on. Have a drink. - I'm okay. - I'm gonna pour you one anyway. So, what have you been up to? Kind of a tough thing about that friend of yours dying, huh? - You want to talk about that? - What time does the plane leave? 11:00 sharp. You wanna hear something? Who's this? - I think it's Devo. - Who? It's a group called Devo. Great. I love it. Yeah. Hey. Hey. I think it's great you could finally get away with your old man, you know? Your mom said maybe you weren't gonna be able to make it. - But here you are. - I'm here. We're going to Hawaii. It's gonna be great. The virus's unknown origin and seeming selectivity is creating fear. Gays, intravenous drug users and Haitians seem particularly to be at risk. The virus reacts almost like a contagious form of cancer. I'm trying to stay positive. I think in my situation it's very... And it's where film meets rock and we're all happy. - Bryan. - Okay, an idea for a movie. And the reason we came to Bryan Metro is because people remember how intense that movie turned out about the life of the band. Holy Christ, man, the four of you guys, Sam and Matt and... - Ed. His name was Ed. - Yeah. Yeah. That's known as a real tragedy, huh? A real shame. Upsetting, too, I bet. Right? When your bassist jumps from the roof of the Clift Hotel, I'd say so. They'd already split up by then, so... Yeah. Well, anyways, since that movie about the life of the band turned out to be so cool and so profitable, without exploiting anyone, we were wondering if you'd be pleased and thrilled to star in a movie, one where you would actually play yourself. We get so many scripts. Bryan turned down Amadeus, so we're very fussy. Well, this movie is basically your typical rock- star- in- outer- space- type thing. There's this alien creature, this ET. - ET? - Extraterrestrial. Alien. Yeah. The ET sabotages Bryan's limo after a gig, and there's a big fiery chase and somehow... - We haven't quite got that nailed yet... - Yeah, go on. You all end up on a planet where Bryan falls in love with a princess. We're thinking Pat Benatar or a Go- Go for that. In order to escape the planet, you have to play in this big concert for the emperor, who's basically this giant tomato. So it's madcap, right? - It's not tacky... - Yes. ...and everyone is getting very excited by it. Bryan? Bryan. Bryan? Thank you so much for coming. Hey, what are you doing here? Christie, you know my sister, Susan, right? - Have you guys met? - Yeah. Hi. Okay, well, I'm gonna get a drink. - Cool, baby. You wanna bring me one, too? - Nice shirt. Ditto. Does she always dress like that? Movies, restaurants and stuff? - You a little jealous? - Graham! Hey, mellow out. Did you know they were gonna go through with it? What? Mom and Dad? Yeah. Mom mentioned something when I woke up. What a scandal, huh? Oh, my God, you're so stoned. You're such a stoner. I can't even talk to you. I'm really not stoned, okay? Just mellow out. - You should talk to him. - And say what exactly? I don't know. ""Dad, this isn't a good idea. Don't go through..."" Okay? All right. Let's take off, all right? What do you say? Graham, do you even care what he did to Mom? And now he's back and he's just gonna do the same thing again. Look, I had to take care of her, okay, Graham? I had to take care of Mom, and I'm not gonna do it again! Graham. Graham! Please. We have to do something, okay? If Dad pulls the same shit again, Mom isn't gonna make it. This will destroy her. Do you understand? Cheryl, there's someone on the phone. - William Sloan. - Thank you. - What? - I called the house and no one answered. I was hoping it was the wrong number. Yeah, well, it's not the wrong number. So why haven't you been home? Because I've been busy. I'm filling in for Suzanne Yakomiato. I really want to see you. What about Laura, William? What about her? What about Laura? I think I really miss you. I think I'm making a big mistake. - Let me go! - Shut up! - Mary, go! - I have no license. Get in the fucking car and drive. What do you think? About what? What do you think I mean? Next to us. Them. What about them? Don't you go out with girls? Pardon me? Don't you, like, date females? What are you asking me? The odds look good. The odds look pretty good. Ladies, what are you drinking tonight? Pahohoes. Pahohoes? That sounds intriguing. They're delicious. Hey, Hickey? Why don't you bring these two gorgeous ladies another round of pahohoes? Where you gals from? We came in from Chicago. I'm Patty and this is Darlene. Yeah. The Windy City. - I know it well. - Where are you both from? Los Angeles. City of Angels. I'm Les Price and this is my son, Tim. He's a little shy. Just the two of you? Just the two of us. Hey. I hope... I hope I'm not being too forward if I may ask you something. - I'm sure you won't be, Les. - Jesus. Well, I was just wondering if you're here with anyone. - We're here alone. - All alone. - All alone. - Can I have the key to the room? - Where are you going? - I'm going to the room. Where do you think I'd be going? You didn't finish your drink. I don't want the drink. Just give me the key. I'll go up with you. No. Just stay here, see how it plays out with Patty and Marlene. That's Darlene. What's wrong with him, Les? Troubles in school. - His mother. - Okay. No, no thanks. You said you were hungry. I made this for you. No, my stomach's queasy. I'm not really hungry anymore. I really don't know how something like this could happen. It all seemed to be going so well and now it's just a big mess. It'll never happen again, I promise. You're not gonna fire me, are you? Well, no, I'm not gonna fire you. Look, I have no idea what this is. - And another one on my foot. - Yeah, I don't know what it is either. Look, Christie, tell me something. What? What do you think about Martin? He's cool. He's hot. Yeah, hot. Well, I know that, but I'm just not sure I'm at the same place that you are, you know, with everything that's been going on with him. Forget it. Sorry I brought it up. Graham. Martin's not even staying here. He's staying at Nina Metro's. Even though he said she was insane. That reminds me. Did you get tickets for tomorrow night at the Greek? Bryan Metro? Graham. You know he doesn't mean as much as you to me. Come on. Graham, we're all just having fun, you know? Like, you take it all so seriously. Yeah, but you're also sleeping with him, and it's just stressing me out. What's wrong? You know I'm on the pill. Graham? - Graham? - Yeah? You're forgetting something. What? We're both sleeping with him. We're both sleeping with Martin. And if I'm cool with that, then... To new beginnings. So I'm totally psyched. We're gonna go see Bryan Metro at the Greek tomorrow night. That is, if Graham remembered to get the tickets. Yeah, I got the tickets, and stop saying ""totally."" - Who'd you get them from? - Actually, honey, from me. - Through the studio. - Good. I'm glad he didn't go through Martin. I didn't want to go through Martin, even though he could have gotten us backstage. Who cares? He's such a stoner. He's so into himself. Him and his totally grody tan and his stupid hair. Plus, Mom, get this. He's a male prostitute. - Why did you direct that statement to me? - Just mellow out, okay? I don't even know why we're talking about Martin. And Mom, Martin's not a male prostitute. That's on the record. Why do you think I would care? Martin is coming to the show with me and Christie, so I hope you get over how, ""like, totally grody"" you think he is by tomorrow night. I hope your girlfriend remembers to wear a shirt by tomorrow night. - Where are you going? - I'm going to the restroom. And hopefully, when I get back, my lovely children will have finished their conversation about their delightful friends. Hi, honey. You're here with her, aren't you? - Yeah. - Oh, God. No, don't. Sweetie, I know you're pissed. I understand, I understand. But I missed you. I couldn't help it. - I can't do this. - You can't do what? You don't want me anymore? Sweetie, I want you so bad. That's not the point, William. I can't sit here again and listen to you quote numbers about how expensive your fucking divorce is gonna be. Is it not enough that you've made everyone fucking miserable? Just stay away. Please. You know, I kept the condo. I haven't given it up yet. We could meet there tomorrow night. What do you say? Or I got the Piper Cub back. It's at the hangar. It's ready to go. We could fly to Vegas and stay at Caesars. - lt'll be amazing. - My God, William, I'm not going to Vegas with you. Well, at least you're going to be at the Brodkey benefit Friday, right? We could talk there. Okay? Sure. - Why not? - Great, honey. That's what I want to hear. It's so good to see your face. We'll figure it out. It'll be okay. - Yeah. - Anyway, I better go. Okay? Fuck! Laura, are we going to the Brodkey benefit on Friday? Why would we go to the Brodkey benefit on Friday night? That's TV. It's not only TV. And it should be fun. - Besides that, it's for a good cause. - It's for a perfume, William. I don't want to go to the Brodkey benefit Friday night. What would you like to do instead? Sleep? Lay by the pool? Maybe count your shoes? Can Daddy borrow 4,000? What the fuck are you still doing here? I thought I told you to go. What? Are you gonna fucking ignore me? What the fuck's going on? What the fuck are you doing, Peter? What the fuck did you do? Answer me, God damn it! Shut your mouth, Jack. What the fuck? The kid's gonna bring us some money. That's the plan. That's the plan I informed you about. This is the plan. Your fucking plan is goddamn holding a kid ransom? It's not me, Jack. It's them freaks I met out in West LA. The people I heard about out in Barstow. They pay 6,000, 7,000 a pop for a package like that. You make me fucking sick. Hey, man, you need to relax. That's your problem, Jackson. You don't know how to kick back. Even when you was a kid out in the desert, and all there was was the sand and the rock and the silence, you could never accept the fact that that's where you belong, and that's where you're always gonna be. That was a long time ago. And we're not in the fucking desert anymore, Uncle Pete. I think we still are. - Hello? - ls Martin there? I don't know. Let me check. Couldn't find him. Do you know where he might be? Have you tried his place in Westwood? - No, I haven't. - He could be there, or he could be finishing up that music video on the hills. - ls this Julie? - Julie? Yeah. The girl Martin picked up at North? With the white rabbit? We all went back to my place and partied with Graham? You and Martin disappeared? Hello? No. This isn't her. I'll call back. Fuck me. Cut. Cut! What the fuck are you doing, dude? I can't see shit. - Hey, Graham. - Yes, totally fucking excellent. Perfect timing, dude. We are so in need of your services. Wait, hold on a second, Leon. We really have to get this shot. The video doesn't make sense without it. It's a fucking video, Martin. It doesn't need to make sense. It just needs to be not lame. Graham, you got us covered? - Yeah, man, you're all set. - Totally excellent. Hey, hey, hey. Isn't Christie supposed to be here? I thought she was supposed to be the star. I did, too. But she's a little unreliable. Maybe you realize that now? So, where are you staying tonight? Probably at Nina's, in Malibu. - Who's Nina? - Nina. Nina Metro. - Bryan Metro's wife? - Ex- wife. Christ. Where are you staying? Honestly, Martin, I don't know how I feel about the situation anymore. I think I'm just gonna crash at my mom's. - Look, I've got eight more shots. - Yeah. You're busy. Can we shoot this, you fucking cokeheads? Hey, Tim, why don't you get your old man another mai tai? - Hey. - What? Why don't you get your dad and yourself a drink? - What do you want? - Mai tai. Okay. What are you up to? Met a girl from San Diego. Hey, come on. - Hey, Cheryl. Nice to see you. - Hi. - How are you, sweetie? - Good. I just wanted to grab a quick salad or something. - Do you have anything open? - Sure. Let me see. Excuse me. Shit! Fuck you, you fucking asshole! - Hi. - Hi. What would you like, hun? A garden salad and a glass of water, please. Okay. - You're Cheryl Moore, right? - Yeah. - I think you're great, honey. - Thank you. The piece you did on the anniversary of Sharon Tate. I remember when that happened. It was so awful. - Yeah. - lt was just so sad. - Thank you. - Yeah. All right. Hey! Aren't you on the news or something? - Yes. - You're Cheryl Moore, right? - Yeah. Do you have a light? - Sure. Listen... Can I have your autograph? 'Cause I am, like, your biggest fan. There you go. Thanks a lot, Cher. By the way, we're opening for Bryan Metro at the Greek tonight. You wanna go? You know, I really don't think I can. Got it. Thanks a lot, Cheryl. Hello? What's going on? How are you? How did you get this number? Did Roger give it to you? Could I just speak to Jamie, please? Well, he can't right now. He's... - He's on the beach with a friend. - Who? A friend of his or a friend of yours? You know, that's just great, Nina. That's great. Can we... Can we just get this over with? Can I just speak to my kid this time without having to freak out? Please? You know you don't even have visitation rights, Bryan. Just put him on the phone, Nina. No, I mean, I don't even know why you want me to say this... Just tell whoever you're fucking to bring my kid out and put him on the phone! Okay. No. You know what, Bryan? I'm going to hang up now. Just because I don't have visitation rights does not mean I'm not allowed to talk to my kid. Now, if you want me to call my lawyers, Nina, I'll call my fucking lawyers! Fuck your fucking lawyers, Bryan! - I'll call my fucking lawyers. - Fuck them! Fuck, all right, Nina, look, I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Please, Nina. I don't mean to shout. I just... Bryan, listen to me. Don't you fucking call me or him ever again. He's fucking afraid of you! Fucking afraid of me? And don't fucking... You... What about you, you Medusa? You fucking Medusa! - Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! - Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! - Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! - Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! - Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! - Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Good evening, sir. Surprised? Do you want to know who I am? Are you from around here? Not really. I'm actually from Nebraska. A little town near Lincoln. You had a job at the mall, right? But the mall closed down, right? It's all empty now, huh? Have you been there? I've been to a mall in Nebraska. It's all flat. It's all totally, totally flat. Come here. Clear the area. All of these vehicles need to be moved. What's going on? You scared me. I don't know. I guess some guy's like threatening to shoot his wife or maybe he shot her or something. They got the SWAT team out there and everything, man. - lf I were you, I wouldn't go out there. - Yeah, I won't. So you're on the eleventh floor, right? Yeah, the guy who does the videos visits you all the time. You mean Martin. It's actually my girlfriend's place. - I'm Graham. - Yeah, I know who you are. - You want a cigarette? - Yeah. It's... It's kind of a small world, 'cause the guy who raised me out here? He used to work at the studio your dad runs. You know, so he was part of the system. But I guess they had to let him go. Something happened with some actress or something, and then he kind of had a breakdown, so we went back to Barstow. But I came back here, 'cause I'm an actor. I was in a commercial for gum, and I was the boyfriend in a Clearasil commercial. You know, it's just kind of hard 'cause you can't really make it in this town unless you're really willing to do some awful things. And, you know, I'm willing. - Yeah, I guess. - But I really want to get into video. That's why I was thinking that Mark guy would be a great contact. It's Martin. All right. Well, thanks for the... - Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah. Hey, where you going? I've got to drink some juice and then get some sleep. You sure you don't want to stay? I could really use the company. Sorry, I gotta go. I think something's gonna happen. Les Price for two at 8:00. It's actually three. - I asked Rachel. - Who's Rachel? The girl I met on the beach today. And when were you going to tell me this? I don't know. Now, I guess. I didn't think it would be a problem. I mean, is it? Well, I guess there's going to be three of us. - Hey, Tim. - Hey, how are you? Good, thanks. Rachel, this is my dad, Les Price. - Hi, Mr. Price. - Hello, Rachel. You here in Hawaii on your own? No, but my parents are in Maui tonight. So... You both look nice. - Thanks, you look great. - Yes. You do. So what did you two do after the beach today? Well, I watched Tim perfect his hair for two hours, then spend another two hours choosing which shirt he's gonna wear. Now I understand why. So did anybody see that Robert Waters is here? - Who's that? - Come on, Tim. Robert Waters. Star of The Flight Patrol. It's a television show. On television. I don't know. I guess I just must not watch enough TV. Yeah, right. Wait. You don't know who Robert Waters is? No, I don't. - You do, I guess? - Well, I met him at Reagan's inauguration. God, I thought everybody knew who Robert Waters is. I don't. - Why do you guys care? - Well, it's a little weird. - Why? - He's here with three guys. The very macho star of Flight Patrol is here with three dudes. So? So one of them tried to pick up Tim today. Me? When? At the beach. Today at the bar. - That guy? - Yeah. That guy. Look, he was nice. He was a nice guy. Yeah, I'm sure he was really nice. Real nice. You smoke? - I told you, Tim. - What? - It's bad for you. - He knows. I told him last night. Am I blowing this in your face? I mean, really? Is this actually bothering you? I mean, we're outside. Look, you just shouldn't smoke, Tim. Okay. I'm gonna go finish this cigarette somewhere else, since you two don't like it. The odds looking pretty good tonight, Dad? - Tim, stop. - Let him go. Well, thank you for dinner, Les. - Hey. Hey. We're not done here. - No, look, just tell Tim that I'm sorry. Let's have another drink. Come on. You know, I'll see you guys tomorrow. Don't let him spoil the party. Come on. We're not going to another shitty party just because you're fucking the hostess, okay? And she's married, and her husband's there. I mean, you'll honestly fuck anybody, right? I fucked you, dude. Nice. Where the fuck was Christie tonight? Wasn't she supposed to be at the party? Christ, I guess I forgot to tell you. She hasn't been feeling too well. She had to stay in. - Wait, are you staying at her place? - No. She moved in with me and Nina. - Nina... Nina Metro, out in the colony? - Yeah. - Since when? - It's been a couple of days. It's weird, she has these night sweats and swollen glands and this weird rash - and these little purple bruises... - Wait, she's sick? Yeah. She wanted to get out of the condo and hang at the beach. She said she'd feel better there. Martin, I need to know something. Are you and Christie, like, fucking around? You guys fuck around when I'm not there? No. No. I wouldn't do that to you. Holy shit. You... Wow. You really, really like her, don't you? This isn't just a thing for you. You actually care about her. - I need something, Martin. - You need some fucking ludes. No, I need something more than this! Graham, what else is there? You already have everything. I need someone to tell me what is good. Okay? And I need someone to tell me what's bad. Because if nobody tells you these things, Martin, then how do you know what's good and what's bad? And then what happens? What happens... What happens then, when nobody tells you these things? - Can I help you? - Hi, I'm Dirk. Who are you? - Nobody. What the fuck do you want? - I'm looking for someone. - Well, I'm the only one here, so... - But I have something to pick up here. I think you've probably got the wrong house. Where's Peter? - He's not here. - Dude, a deal was made. Now I don't know who you are, but there's something here that now belongs to us. Look, I don't want any trouble, so I think you should just leave, all right? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, all right? - You got the wrong place. - No. This is the right place. The fuck are you looking at? Look, I told you, Peter's not here. And I don't know anything about what the fuck you're talking about. - I'm just really tired. - This is very important, so think carefully before you answer. Tell me where the fuck Peter is. I can't tell you that, 'cause I don't know. This is simple. Peter was paid. We want what we paid for. - Now where is it? - I swear to God, I don't know. Well, you better find out because he will be in a very dark place if we become disappointed, and we're becoming extremely disappointed. As soon as he gets back, I'll tell him. I just don't know when that's gonna be. I'll see you again. Laura. I... I need a shot, and I couldn't find any syringes anywhere. I mean, with the move and everything. You don't have any, do you? I've got one in here. I saw her, William. I saw her at the restaurant. - You saw who? - Don't make me say her fucking name. - What are you talking about? - Just go get dressed. I'm not gonna have this conversation with you if you're going to lie. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it anymore! If you want to talk to me, you're going to tell me the truth! - Yeah, I want to talk to you. - The other night at dinner. When you came back and you sat down at the table and you said the Brodkeys' benefit. I know why you want to go. I know why you want to go. Do you think I'm an idiot? - No. - You know what I do wonder? If you still have feelings for her, then why are you in this house? Why are you still in this house? Are you that selfish? To think that I would stay here with you while you fucked her? Is that what you're thinking? Do you ever think about anybody else but yourself? Do you ever think about me? Do you ever think about your children? - Our children. - Our children! You did this for our children? For Graham? He's in college. He deals drugs. And he thinks you're a joke. - And Susan? Susan loathes you! - That's not true. Yes, that is very true! For one time, for one time in your goddamned life, be honest with me, William. Did you ever love me? Did you ever love me? - Tell me, did you ever love me... - I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You were afraid you'd be lonely, is that it? You were afraid you'd have to give me 50 of everything you think you own, is that it? No. That's not what this is about. God. Oh, God. I'll go to the benefit with you. And we'll walk in there and we'll wink and we'll wave and we'll have drinks, and we'll let everybody know we're just fine. And then you can come back home here and you can pack your things and you can leave. So, yes, I'll go to the Brodkey benefit with you. Why would you want to do that? I want to see her. Hey! Where you been? You weren't in the room. Tim, what's wrong? What happened? What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. You want to talk? Did you just ask me if I want to talk? Well, yeah. Yeah. We could talk. What? What are we gonna talk about, Dad? I don't know. You tell me. There's nothing to talk about. Please... Please, Tim, come on. There's nothing to talk about. Come on. Give me a chance. Don't ruin my chances. You don't have any chances left to ruin, dude. Come on, Tim, you don't mean that. There's nothing. There's nothing. Just accept it. It's easier that way. Just forget it. There's nothing you can tell me, and there's nothing I'm going to tell you, Dad, that's gonna make any difference. Some fucking blond kid came by the house. Yeah, what did he say? - He was asking me about a package. - Yeah? Did you give it to him? No, I told him we didn't have it. What? - What did Dirk say? - What? You know his fucking name? What did Dirk say, Jack? - He said he'd be back. - Fuck! They're gonna kill us! They're gonna kill us! Who the fuck are these people? I think it would be in our best interest if you get your shit and we get the fuck out of here, okay? I told you. I told you we shouldn't have come here. Shut the fuck up, Mary! Just get your shit and let's get out of here, okay? No, it's not my fucking problem. I got a fucking job. I can't just fucking pack up and move. You don't know what they're capable of, okay? You ain't got a goddamn clue. They're like out of a fucking nightmare. So get your shit together and let's get the fuck out of here. Come on, Mary! What are you doing? Listen, if we leave the kid here and they find him, this is a more humane way than letting them get their hands on him. Let me do it. Let you do what? - Let you do what? - I'll handle it. How are you gonna handle it? I'm gonna cut his fucking throat. Get the fucking van ready. Come on, Mary. - Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! - Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Clean yourself. Just clean yourself up. - Hello? - Yes, hello, I'm looking for Graham. - Yeah? - Graham, it's Nina Metro. - I'm calling about... - Who? We've actually got an emergency with Christie. I was hoping you could come down. - Hello, can I help you? - Hi. - I'm Graham. - You're Graham? Yeah. She's really sick. She needs to see a doctor, but she's so stubborn, we can't talk her into it. - Well, where's her dad? - He's on location in ltaly. - That's an answer? - She needs help, Graham. - Why do you think I can help her? - Well, aren't you the one that loves her? What's that gonna fix? Is that gonna help her? Hey. What are you trying to tell me, baby? What are you saying? I want... I want to stay. But it's getting cold. But I need more sun. There's no more sun."
43,2006,The Prestige,American,"In 1890s London Robert Angier and Alfred Borden work as shills for Milton the Magician, alongside stage engineer (ingénieur) Cutter and assistant Julia, Angier's wife. Milton's famous trick is the water tank trick, where Julia is bound in ropes and dropped in a water tank from which she frees herself. When Borden ties her hands with a riskier slip knot, Julia fails to slip the knot and drowns, devastating Angier and fueling his deep-seated grudge against Borden.
Angier and Borden part ways and launch their own solo magic careers. However, they both work to sabotage each other's acts. Borden develops a trick he calls ""The Transported Man,"" where he instantly travels between two wardrobes on opposite ends of a stage. Angier discovers the trick and steals it for himself. Not knowing how it is performed he hires Root to double for him. ""The New Transported Man"" is a huge success, but Angier is displeased, as he ends the trick hidden under the stage while Root basks in the applause.
Obsessed with Borden's secret, Angier orders his assistant Olivia to spy on him. However, Olivia falls in love with Borden and aids him with his show. When confronted by Angier she gives him a copy of Borden's diary, which he decodes with the help of Cutter and Bordens kidnapped ingénieur. The codeword, a secret to Borden's success, is revealed to be Tesla. Angier decides to travel to America and meet scientist Nikola Tesla. Meanwhile, Bordens wife, Sarah, becomes depressed over his fickle and contradictory ways and commits suicide.
Angier asks Tesla to build him the machine he built for Borden. Angier discovers Borden's diary is fraudulent. Borden ordered Olivia to give Angier the diary to send him away. Angier confronts Tesla, who admits to never having built any device for Borden but has successfully built a replicating machine for Angier, capable of reproducing animate and inanimate objects a distance from the machine. As Tesla departs, he advises Angier to destroy the machine.
Returning to London, Angier debuts 'The Real Transported Man' where he vanishes within the machine and appears atop the balcony at the back of the hall. Baffled by the trick's success, Borden sneaks backstage, only to witness Angier drop through a trap door and plunge into a waiting water tank. Cutter stumbles upon the scene and Borden is arrested. Borden is found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. In prison, Borden is visited by an agent of a Lord Caldlow, who offers to care for Borden's daughter Jess in exchange for all of Borden's tricks.
He agrees to the terms and surrenders all his secrets. Lord Caldlow visits Borden revealing himself as being Angier. Baffled, Borden begs for his life, but Angier ignores his pleas. Borden is hanged and dies. Cutter learns that Caldlow has bought Angier's machine. When he visits him to plead for its destruction, he discovers Caldlow's identity. Although disgusted, Cutter agrees to help him dispose of the machine in his theater.
After Cutter leaves a stranger enters the theater and shoots Angier. He reveals himself as Borden's twin brother. ""Alfred Borden"" is the identity they both assumed as part of their act and maintained outside the stage. One twin loved Sarah, while the other loved Olivia. They both took turns being the ""Transported Man"". Angier dies as his fallen lantern sets the theater on fire. Borden picks up Jess at Cutter's workshop. A final glimpse of the burning theater shows rows of water tanks containing rotting duplicates of Angier.",8.5,tt0482571,"Are you watching closely? Every magic trick consists of three parts, or acts. The first part is called ""the pledge."" The magician shows you something ordinary. A deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it, to see that it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But, of course, it probably isn't. Where do you think you're going? I'm part of the bloody act, you fool. The second act is called ""the turn."" The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret, but you won't find it, because, of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be... fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet, because making something disappear isn't enough. You have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act. The hardest part. The part we call... ...""the prestige."" The prestige? And did Robert Angier, the Great Danton, your employer, get to that final part of his trick that night? - No, sir. Something went wrong. - What went wrong? I saw someone making their way below stage. I followed him. It was Borden, watching Mr. Angier drown. Would you please describe your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter. I'm an ingénieur, I design illusions and construct the apparatus necessary for performing them. So, Mr. Cutter, was this water-filled tank beneath the stage part of Mr. Angier's illusion? No. The tank was brought on for the first trick and then taken offstage. Borden must have placed it under the trap door after the end of it. How large was this tank? It's a normal tank for escape under water, about or gallons. How do you think he was able to move the tank under the trap door without anyone noticing? He's a magician, ask him. I ask again, would this man explain the mechanics of Mr. Angier's illusion. The Real Transported Man is one of the most sought after illusions in this business. I have the right to sell it on. If I reveal the method here, the trick is worthless. How can we know that the tank wasn't simply some part of the trick that went wrong? Mr. Cutter, I see your predicament. But Alfred Borden's life hangs in the balance. If you were prepared to disclose the details to me in private, I might be able to judge their relevance to the case. Might this be an acceptable compromise? I'm going to have to ask you to turn out your pockets. Not my idea, sir. The warden saw his show in Manchester last year where he vanished into thin air. He's convinced he'll try and escape. I told him the only way Borden's going to disappear is if I leave him out there with the other inmates. Check the locks... ...twice. My name is Owens. I'm a solicitor. I represent Lord Caldlow, an accomplished amateur magician and... How much? - He is interested... - How much for my tricks? Five thousand pounds. Talk to Fallon, my ingénieur. Money's for him. Yes, I did. He offered to sell me your tricks. All except the most valuable one, The Transported Man. Well, I won't forgive myself for selling my greatest trick. Even for your daughter? If you are for the drop, your daughter is going to need looking after. Fallon will take care of her. Perfect, Fallon. A man with a past as obscure as your own. The courts have motioned she be removed from his care. She will be an orphan. I know you're no stranger to the workhouse. It's better than here? I'm offering you a way to wrap up your affairs with dignity. I'm offering your daughter a future. As Lord Caldlow's ward, she will want for nothing... ...ever. Well, think it over. And Lord Caldlow would like you to have this, as a show of good faith. It might be of interest. Robert Angier's diary, including the time he spent in Colorado learning your trick. - He never learned it. - Really? On his return, he mounted a version of The Transported Man that the papers said was better even than your original. If you want Angier's secrets, you go dig him up and ask him yourself. I want your secret, Mr. Borden. Consider your daughter. A cipher, an enigma... ...a search, a search for answers. Even if Colorado is the end of my journey, it'll take much longer to unravel the rest of Borden's secrets. See, the cipher in his notebook is unlocked by a single word, but it will still take months to translate his writing. And to know his mind. Well, my passion is equal to the task. Mr. Angier, welcome to Colorado Springs. - The whole town has electricity. - Yes, sir. Well... ...quite a reception. You're our first guest of the season, Mr. Angier. Your telegram didn't indicate how long you'd be staying with us. As long as it takes. I will need a coach tomorrow to take me up the mountain. Well, the peak's closed, sir. For scientific experimentation. Yes, I know. That's why I'm here. Whoa. Whoa. You'll have to walk the rest, I'm afraid, sir. I'm amazed how many of you newspaper writers can't read my sign. Not the welcome I was expecting. I know you. You're the Great Danton. I saw your show in London. Seven times you guessed every object the audience had in their pockets. I'm Alley. Sorry about the fence. People keep interfering with our work. - I've come to see Tesla. - Why? He made a machine for a colleague of mine some time ago. - Can you get me a meeting with him? - Impossible, I'm afraid. I've brought a lot of money. I'm sorry, Mr. Angier. I simply can't help. I'll be staying at the hotel, indefinitely. Hey, what am I holding? Your watch. Borden's journal entry for April 3, 1897, describes a show at the Orpheum Theater. That was just days after he first met me. We were two young men at the start of a great career, two young men devoted to an illusion, two young men who never intended to hurt anyone. Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman? Me! If you would tie her wrists, bind her feet... ...around the ankle. Are either of you two gentlemen sailors? - No. - No. I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot. He's complacent, he's predictable, he's boring. Milton has gotten success, whatever that means, so now he's scared. He won't take any risks at all. He's squandering the goodwill of his audience with tired, - second-rate tricks... - They're all favorites. Give me something fresh. He won't even try a bloody bullet catch. A bullet catch is suicide. All it takes is some smartass volunteer to put a button in the barrel. - Use a plant. - You can't for every trick. No seats left for the punters. All right, no bullet catch, whatever, but the point is a real magician tries to invent something new that other magicians will scratch their heads over. Then you sell it to him for a small fortune. - What? - I suppose you have such a trick? - I sure do. - Would you care to sell it to me? No. No one else can do my trick. - Any trick can be duplicated. - Wrong. If Mr. Borden has invented his masterpiece, he's prepared to do it. Milton is a showman, but Borden is right, he won't get his hands dirty. If you want to see what it takes to make real magic, go to the Tenley. There's a Chinaman there and he really has what it takes. - Chung Ling Soo. - I can't afford that. I know the bloke run the door. You two go and see that show, and whichever one of you can tell me how he does the goldfish bowl trick gets the prize. - Which is? - Ten minutes onstage with my old friend, Mr. Ackerman. - Really? - Who's Ackerman? The top theatrical agent in London. - I saw you drop the knot again. - I turned my wrists. Some nights you just don't get it, do you? I mean, if that knot slips and Julia's on the hoist, she'll break her leg. It's the wrong knot. Like I said, the Langford double will hold tighter. The Langford double isn't a wet knot. It's too dangerous. If the rope swells, she can't slip it. - I can slip a Langford underwater. - We can practice. - Borden, he said no. - Oh, you know knots better than me? Listen, no more mistakes. All right. Yeah? Do you? You want to take over? - Just leave. - I didn't think so. Hey, Cutter, where's he from? Where are you from? He shifts props for Virgil at the hall. - Worried he'll steal your tricks? - Doesn't deal in methods. - How do you know? - Because I hired him to find out how Virgil does the orange trick. - I don't trust him. - He's a natural magician. 'Course you can't trust him. I think he's all right. - You think everyone's all right. - Even you. Watch your sightlines. If I can see you kiss your wife's leg every night, so can the blokes at the ends of rows three and four! You're wrong. It can't be. - Look at the man. - This is the trick. This is the performance. Right here. This is why no one can detect his method. Total devotion to his art. A lot of self-sacrifice. You know. It's the only way to escape... ...all this, you know? I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water. Or fish, look. I don't know. Hang on a second. He must be strong as an ox. He's been pretending to be a cripple for years. Any time he's in public, any time he goes out. It's unthinkable. Borden saw it at once. But I couldn't fathom it. Living my whole life pretending to be someone else. You are pretending. I don't think changing a name compares. Not your name. Who you are and where you're from. I promised I wouldn't embarrass my family with my theatrical endeavors. I thought of a name for you. The Great Danton. Do you like it? But it's sophisticated. It's French. Borden writes as if no one but he understood the true nature of magic. But what does he know of self-sacrifice? You bloody fool. - He killed it. - It's OK. - He killed it. - He didn't. Look, now he'll bring it back. - No, he killed it. - No, he didn't. Look, see, he's all right. He's fine. - Look at him. - But where's his brother? He's a sharp lad, your son. Oh, he's my nephew. Ah. You're the lucky one today. Are you watching closely? Look closer. Never show anyone. They'll beg you and flatter you for the secret, but as soon as you give it up, you'll be nothing to them. You understand? Nothing. The secret impresses no one. The trick you use it for is everything. Well, thank you for lunch, Mr. Borden. You're welcome. Alfred, it's Alfred. Alfred. So I could use a cup of tea. I can't allow... It's the landlord. It's not... You think that's... Is that enough to keep me out? I think so. So I'll see you again? Milk and sugar? What's in there? Angier's machine. You built this, Mr. Cutter? Oh, no, sir. This wasn't built by a magician. This was built by a wizard. A man who can actually do what magicians pretend to do. Tell me, Your Honor, what happens with these things after the trial? They've been sold to a Lord Caldlow. An avid collector, very interested in the case. Yeah. Well, don't let him take this. - Why ever not? - It's too dangerous. I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it's got a simple and disappointing trick. The most disappointing of all, sir. It has no trick. It's real. This is the tank Angier drowned in? Yes. This is the... ...place where the performer's hand reaches through to the trick padlock. A standard magical apparatus for escapes? Yeah, with one important difference. This isn't a trick lock. It's been switched for a real one. What a way to kill someone. They're magicians, Your Honor. Showmen, men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths, to amaze, to shock. Even without an audience? There was an audience. You see, this water tank was of particular significance to these two men. Particularly awful significance. Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman? If you would tie her wrists, bind her feet around the ankle. - Are either of you gentlemen sailors? - No. I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot. Robert! No, no. Julia. Julia! I knew an old sailor once. They told me he went overboard, tangled in the sails. They pulled him out, but it took him five minutes to cough. He said it was like... ...going home. What do you want, Borden? I'm sorry for your loss, Angier. Which knot did you tie? I keep asking myself that. - And? - And... I'm sorry, I just don't know. You don't know? I'm sorry. You don't know? You don't know?! - Alfred? - Good news. We got our first booking. I don't think we've had the pleasure. - Mr. Fallon is my ingénieur. - Where did you get all...? - I had to borrow and... don't ask. - He's a very enterprising soul is... is Mr. Fallon. So... - We can't afford to pay him. - The money will come with the audience. But what about until then? What I earn, it's barely enough for us. Don't worry about it. I'll share half my food with him or something. You're going to be doing that with someone else. No. You're... Having a baby. Oh, my God. We should have told Fallon. That is great. Oh, come here. Oh. Alfred, what is this? Oh, this is just the trick to work Ackerman up at the end of my act. Is it the masterpiece, the great trick? No, no, no, the world is not ready for that one yet. This is just your run-of-the-mill, daring, spectacular bullet catch. - A bullet catch. - Yeah, but it's safe. I promise. Look. - Shoot me. - Shoot you? Go on, shoot me. - Right there. - No, I can't. No, no, not there. Shoot me here. Don't... How's that? That's very good. Tell me how you do it. No, I can't do that. - Well, then you can't do it. - I can't do it? I'm sorry, but I can't raise a child on my own. You don't tell anybody that I told you. - OK. - Gunpowder. Wadding. Then the bullet. Ramrod. Hold out your hand. The bullet is not even in the gun when the charge is fired. Once you know, it's actually very obvious. Well, I mean, you still get... It's dangerous. - People still get killed doing that. - How? You get some smartass who could put a penny or a button or, God forbid, Sarah, somebody could put a bullet down there. Don't worry. Don't worry, because I'm not gonna let anything happen. Everything's gonna be all right because... ...I love you very much. - Say it again. - I love you. - Not today. - What? Well, some days it's not true, and today you don't mean it. Maybe today you're more in love with magic than me. I like being able to tell the difference. It makes the days it is true mean something. All right. Metal rings, ladies and gentlemen. If there are any ladies and gentlemen here. - Solid metal. - Seen that already. Who threw that? This is what you came for, is it? So... ...who wants to volunteer? - I do! - Me! Me. Me. Are you man enough, sir? Yes. Which knot did you tie, Borden? Which knot did you tie, Borden? I don't know. He came in to demand an answer, and I told him the truth. That I have fought with myself over that night, one half of me swearing blind that I tied a simple slipknot, the other half convinced that I tied the Langford double. I can never know for sure. How can he not know! How can he not know? He must know what he did. He must. Sarah, that bloody hurts. I don't understand how it can be bleeding again. It's as bad as the day it happened. - We have to get a doctor back. - We can't afford the doctor back. - You've woken her. - Great. I'm sorry, I need this to heal so I can get back to work. You've got to face things. What tricks can you perform with this injury? I can do car pulls. I can do some prop tricks. I can still do that. I can do the trick I've been telling you about. The one that they're gonna remember me for. Come on. I never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass. Hasn't stopped your looking. Heard about a booking. Nice little theater. - Young, up-and-coming magician. - Who? - You. - Me? Booking? Why? I want to keep on working. Who's going to hire the ingénieur that killed Julia McCullough in front of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum? Someone who knows it wasn't your fault. Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots. I hear he had a spot of bad luck catching a bullet south of the river. That's a dangerous trick, that one. We'll have to whitewash the windows, confound the more curious members of the public, but it will do. - We should see about an assistant. - I've made some arrangements. You settled on a name? Yes, I have. The Great Danton. It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it? No, it's sophisticated. The birdcage can't be our climax. Everybody knows it. - Not like this. - I don't want to kill doves. Then stay off the stage. You're a magician, not a wizard. You got to get your hands dirty, if you're going to achieve the impossible. In here, Miss Wenscombe. No point in meeting Mr. Angier if you don't fit. On the right. - What's so hard about this? - Nothing. You're going... down here. - And this will conceal, right? - Oh, sure. - Tighten up on there. - Yep. OK. This ties up here? - Ties in the back. - Good. Breathe as little as possible. Now, you see? - That's it. - OK. She's not experienced, but she knows how to present herself. A pretty assistant is the most effective form of misdirection. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, for my final trick, I will require the assistance of two volunteers. Mr. Merrit, if you would oblige me? Yep. - Under? - Under, yeah. Come around his foot. - Careful. - It's all right. - Your volunteer, put their hand there. - Yeah? And another one here. If you'll place your hands on either side of the cage, please. Thank you, Olivia. You best not be intending to hurt this animal, Mr. Angier. - Of course not. - Ready? Right. - One... - Two... Three. That's bloody marvelous, Cutter. Very nice. And the best part is... I thought you said I had to get my hands dirty. Someday, perhaps you will. I just had to know that you can. Very nice. Very nice, indeed. I haven't had the chance to compliment you on your beautiful theater. It'll be a lot more beautiful when it's full. Don't worry. You all say that. Why should I worry? If your tricks don't get them in, somebody else's will. Maybe somebody willing to do a bullet catch or a water escape? Cheap thrills, Mr. Merrit. People hoping for an accident, likely to see one too. What would that do for your business? You got a week, John. Thank you, Mr. Merrit. Thank you. Uh... Sir, in the third row there. Please stand up and show us your handkerchief. This isn't mine. Perhaps you'd return it to the lady in the aisle of the second row. I believe she has yours. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm making so many mistakes. I'm so nervous. The audience doesn't seem to be responding. They've seen a lot of tricks before, but not this next one. Cloth over. Keep your fingers crossed. I'll have the champagne ready. - You've seen this one before? - We've seen them all before. I'll make it a little harder then, shall I? Two volunteers, please. A lady and a gentlemen. To hold this cage with me. I'll perform this feat in a manner never before seen by yourselves or any other audience anywhere in the world. Madame, place one hand on the back of the cage, one hand on the front. Sir, one hand on the bottom of the cage one hand on the top. - I should've spotted him. - You had a lot of plates going. - Don't suppose we can do this again. - No. - So, what's the climax of our show? - Show? - You don't have a show. - We have a week's engagement. To perform magic, not butcher birds and break my customers' fingers. Clear out, anything here in the morning gets burned. - Mr. Merrit... - It's done, John. I've hired a comedian. You know I hate comedians. Well, there's plenty of good theaters. If we can come up with a new trick, - change the name of the act. - The name stays. Right, well, then the new trick's gonna have to be irresistible then. I have a couple of methods to try out. And then we need a new angle on the presentation. And if you need some inspiration, there's a technical exposition at the Albert Hall this week. Engineers, scientists, you know? That sort of thing captures the public's imagination. Mind if I join you? Tesla sends me down here during the storms. Perfect excuse to come join the Great Danton for a drink. Two of them. Beautiful, isn't it? God, I miss New York, though. - Why are you here? - The lightning lives here. And not much else. Our work is secret. That a cipher? A rotating transposition that shifts every day of the diary. Simple but time-consuming to translate, even with the five-letter keyword. Which is? We magicians have a circle of trust. You have a circle of trust with someone whose diary you stole? Maybe I bought it. And you're hoping to find a great secret in there? I've already found it. That's why I'm here. Tesla built one for another magician. Why would you want the same thing? Call it a professional rivalry. Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people. - But he would never talk about it. - I understand discretion. I just want the machine. Finish your drink. I want to show you something. I think you'll have a special appreciation for our work. - I thought it was a secret. - You're a magician. Who's gonna believe you? Not long now. Our equipment requires a great deal of current. Tesla electrified the whole town in exchange for using the generators when we need them. We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep. Mr. Tesla doesn't want to scare anyone. Where are the wires? Exactly. Where's the generator? You saw it last week. - That must be ten miles from here. - Fifteen. And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed. I'll send word for you in a few days, Mr. Angier. Magic. Real magic. Now appearing, only here at London's Royal Albert Hall, one of the miracles of our age. A technological marvel. You've never seen anything like it in your lives. Your eyes will not believe what they're witnessing. The miracle of Nikola Tesla, ladies and gentlemen. Free, clean power. Like to know the future? The man who's speaking right now is going to change the world. Come one, come all. Immediate seating, no waiting. Ladies and gentlemen, objections have been raised... They should be raised. Does that look safe to you? Part of Thomas Edison's smear campaign against Mr. Tesla's superior alternating current. We have asked Mr. Tesla to reconsider. Which he will not! But I've been told he refuses to appear under any such restrictions. This thing's gonna blow. Ladies and gentlemen, please. Hey. Hello, Jess. Have you had a nice day with mommy? Huh? Sarah. - I love you. - See, today it's true. - Yeah. - Hello. I saw happiness. Happiness that should have been mine. But I was wrong. His notebook reveals that he never had the life that I envied. The family life that he craves one minute, he rails against the next, demanding freedom. His mind... his mind is a divided one. His soul is restless. His wife and child, tormented by his fickle and contradictory nature. So, what do you think you'll call her? I don't know. Everybody needs a name, so, what's hers? Maybe Sarah. That's a lovely name. That's a lovely name. Well, you talk about what you want to do for the rest of the day. All right, go on, you talk with her. Are they taking her away? To the workhouse? You keep talking. Tell Owens I've reconsidered. Take it. Go on, take it. It's for the best. Let me see. I'm gonna learn all the professor's secrets. Only if I teach you how to read. They're just stupid tricks, right? Haven't helped you get out of here, have they? Or can't you undo real locks, professor? Maybe I'm just biding my time. Maybe one day I'll... ...open my hand, get your attention, ask, ""Are you watching closely?"" Maybe a magic whirl or two. And then I'll be gone. How'd you get so famous then? Magic. Oi! Borden, get back here! Thank you. Shut up! Where's the bloody key?! February 8, 1899. Today, finally, a breakthrough. Tesla's agreed to see me. Perfectly safe. So this is the Great Danton. Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions. Hold out other hand. - What's conducting the electricity? - Our bodies, Mr. Angier. Quite capable of conducting and, indeed, producing energy. Have you eaten, Mr. Angier? I need something impossible. You're familiar with the phrase, ""Man's reach exceeds his grasp""? Is a lie. Man's grasp exceeds his nerve. Society only tolerates one change at a time. First time I tried to change the world, I was hailed as a visionary. Second time... ...I was asked politely to retire. So here I am, enjoying my retirement. Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier. What you want is simply expensive. If I were to build for you this machine, you would be presenting it merely as illusion? Well, if people actually believed the things I did on stage, they wouldn't clap, they'd scream. Think of sawing a woman in half. Have you considered the cost of this? Price is not an object. Perhaps not, but have you considered the cost? I'm not sure I follow. Go home, forget this thing. I can recognize an obsession. - No good will come of it. - Hasn't good come of your obsessions? At first, but I have followed them too long. I am their slave. And one day, they will choose to destroy me. If you understand an obsession, then you know you won't change my mind. So be it. Will you build it? I've already begun to build it, Mr. Angier. I hope you enjoy the mountain air. This will take some time. Uh... I thought you'd gone. I don't really have anywhere to go. You've been sleeping here? Cutter said it'd be all right till we get another booking. What are you doing? Uh... research. Part of a magician's job is to... watch his competition, see what illusions... You're going to do something to that man, aren't you? Cutter's hoping you let things lie. He says if Borden thinks things are even between you... Even? My wife for a couple of his fingers? He has a family now and he's performing again. Borden is out there living his life just as he intended, as if nothing had happened and look at me. I'm alone and no theater will touch me. Us. You're going to need a better disguise. I need a volunteer. What happened? Did you hurt him? What happened, Robert? You, sir. Just a rubber ball, yes? Thank you. Just a rubber ball? No. Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball. It's magic. He had a new trick. Was it good? It was the greatest magic trick I've ever seen. Did they applaud when you saw it? It was too good. It was too simple. The audience hardly had time to see it. - He's a dreadful magician. - A wonderful magician. He's a dreadful showman. He doesn't dress it up, - how to sell it. - How does he do it? - He uses a double. - No, it's too simple. This is a complex illusion. You say that because you don't know the method. It's a double that comes out. It's the only way. I've seen him perform it three times. The prestige is the same man. - No, it's not. - The same man comes out of the cabinet. It's the same man. He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers, but, if you look closely, you can tell. He doesn't know how to sell it to an audience, but I do. Yeah, we could use it as a climax to the show. Yes. The man stole my life, I'm gonna steal his trick. We got to find someone who looks like you. - He doesn't use a double. - I don't know how Borden does it. Either... You either wait for him to retire and buy the secret, or you listen to how I would do it. And the only way that I know how to do it is to find you a bloody good double. All right. Take a good look. Let's get out there and find me. Whoo! Look, look. What's that? - It's for you. - What's this for? Come. You... - I asked you last week... - You caught me in a wrong mood. - But you won't ever... - Sarah, I'm gonna have to change my mind, aren't I? The act is taking off. Soon we'll be in a bigger theater, things will work out. I can't believe it. Thank you. Thank you. It's beautiful. - Gerry? - Darling, look at you. Mr. Cutter, Mr. Angier, I'd like you to meet Gerald Root. Mm-hm. A pleasure. Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen. Would you like for me to tell you a little joke? Come here. Yes. Are you laughing now? I have to take a piss. - He's out of his mind. - Of course, he's an out-of-work actor. He's perfect. He needs a little help. But when I get done with him, he could be your brother. I don't need him to be my brother, I need him to be me. Give me a month. So you open the door... ...and... Come on. Couldn't you have found a softer one? Well, it's not for sleeping on. So, if you come down through there... - ...does Root go up through there? - Yep. It's going to be amazing. Well, it has to be. Borden's trick is getting noticed. The place was packed today. You went and saw his show again. Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Angier? All I have to do is keep myself stinking drunk, and no one will be able to tell the difference. Have a little faith, sir. Now, would you favor us with a performance, Mr. Root? You'd drink, too, if you knew the world half as well as I do. Did you think you were unique? I've been Caesar, I've played Faust. How difficult could it possibly be to play the Great Danton? You can go back to being yourself now, Root, for nothing. I'd rather be him for now. I find it, uh... amusing. ""My liege, I did deny no prisoners."" - You look wonderful. - Oh, thank you. Root has to keep a low profile. Anyone sees him, the game's up. I don't know how you do things. I'm not sure I wanna know. Have you thought what we should call it? There's no point being coy. Borden calls his trick The Transported Man. Ladies and gentlemen, much of what you've seen may be termed as illusions or entertaining trifles. Alas... ...I cannot claim this next feat as illusion. Watch carefully. You will see no trickery, for no trickery is employed. Merely a technique familiar to certain citizens of the Orient and various holy men of the Himalayas. Indeed, many of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who are not, do not be alarmed. What you're about to see is considered safe. To our achievement. The manager says he's never seen a reaction like it. At least he saw it. I spent the ovation hiding under the stage. No one cares about the man who disappears. They care about the one who comes out. I care about the man in the box. Thank you. I don't know, maybe we could switch before the trick. I'm the prestige, and Root's below stage. No, the anticipation of the trick is everything. We need your showmanship to build up the suspense. Once Root opens his mouth, it's over. He can't introduce this trick. Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton. Root, you bloody fool, get out of that wardrobe and makeup. Anyone could walk in here at any minute. Congratulations, all. Life is not full of these moments. We worked hard. We need to celebrate properly. What's wrong? Is it your wife? No, it's the trick. It isn't good enough. Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours. He has no style. He doesn't spend the finale hiding under the stage. - I need to know how he does it. - Why? So I can do it better. I need you to go and work for him. Work for him? Are you joking? You'll be my spy. We just got our start. You want me to leave? That's how we advance. Think of it. People are excited by Cutter's version. Imagine what we'd do with the real illusion. We'd have the greatest magic act anyone's ever seen. - He knows I work for you. - Exactly why he'll want to hire you. - He'll want my secret. - Why would he trust me? Because you're gonna tell him the truth. Hmm? Good girl. You must be curious to see what so much money has bought you. Fitting you should be here for her maiden voyage. Your hat. You might want to stand back. I don't understand. Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it. Is there a problem, Mr. Tesla? - No. Come back next week. - Next week? - Next week, it will be fine. - Tesla! Just a little temperamental. - Interesting workshop. - Yeah, we make do. - My name is Olivia... - I know who you are. Here to steal the rest of my show? To give your show what it's missing. - Yeah, what might that be? - Me. I was just saying that, wasn't I? - A woman's touch. - I've left Angier. - All right. - I want a job. Yeah. I know you've no reason to trust me. Why wouldn't I trust you? You're only the mistress of my enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you? - Mr. Borden. - Alfred. I'm going to tell you the truth. Now that is a slippery notion in our line of work, isn't it, Miss Wenscombe? I am here because he sent me here. He wants me to work for you and steal your secret. What does he need my secret for? His trick is topnotch. He vanishes, and then he reappears instantly on the other side of the stage, mute, overweight and, unless I'm mistaken, very drunk. It's astonishing. How does he do it? And tell me, Olivia, does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage? It's killing him. He's obsessed with discovering your methods. He thinks of nothing else, takes no pleasure in our success. And I've had enough. There is no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've come to offer you his. This is the truth... is it? Think you'd better get dressed, sir. Root, you're late and more drunk than usual. Get down below stairs right away. No. No, we need to have a little chat, Mr. Cutter. We have a problem. Cutter, Borden is performing right across the street. Yeah, we have a bigger problem. Root. He's realized that he can make demands. Wha...? He's blackmailing us? I was surprised, to tell you the truth. It usually takes them a lot longer to figure it out. - How much does he want? - It makes no difference. - We've got to stop doing the trick. - Stop the trick? Look at this. Last week they said you were the premier stage performer in London. Not magician, mind you. Performer of any kind. - What's your point? - My point is, you've climbed too high to get away with professional embarrassment. We don't do any tricks we can't control. Just pay him for now. We keep doing the trick until Borden opens, and then we'll phase it out. All right. Cutter was always surprised how fast Root turned bad. To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale? - You're the Great Danton, aren't you? - Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh. Of course I am, but don't advertise it, because I'll be mobbed with fans. We paid him enough to keep him in beers. You wouldn't expect him to rock the boat. Many of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed. What you're about to see is considered safe. - And who are you? - I am a humble admirer and a fellow practitioner. Mmm. Very good. - Another one? - Oh, if you insist. - Another. - I'm not performing tonight. I'm only doing one show, but to be frank, my people pretty much run things these days. Get up there. Get up! Your illusion, The Transported Man, I'm not claiming to know your methods, but I had a similar trick in my act, and, uh... I used a double. - Mm, I see, very good. - Well, it was, and then it went bad. What I didn't count on was that when I incorporated this bloke into my act, he had complete power over me. Complete power, you say? Ohh! Be very careful giving someone that power over you. Huh. Thank you. Um... Yes, thank you for the warning. Hmm. Cheers. I cannot claim this next feat as illusion. What you're about to see is considered safe. Ahh! Oh! The Great Danton. I apologize. There simply is too much magic... ...for my stage at The Pantages across the street. Pardon my intrusion. And go easy on the poor chap. He does try so very hard. I don't know how Borden found him. Kept him under wraps. I was careful. Yeah, well, he did. Do you think it was her? You weren't expecting me? I expected you sooner. Your message said afternoon. It takes a bit for me to get around these days. He's taken everything from me. My wife, my career, - now you. - You sent me. I sent you to steal his secret, not to improve his act. - It's my job. - Or fall in love! - I did everything you asked! - Yes? Yes? - How does he do it? - Cutter was right, a double. - 'Course he said that. - He didn't say it. I've seen things, makeup, glasses, wigs. We don't use for the show. - I've seen it hidden backstage. - Misdirection. He leaves them lying around to make you think that. He doesn't know when I'm looking. All the time, Olivia! That's who he is! That's what it takes! He lives his act, don't you see? Just because you're sleeping with him doesn't mean he trusts you. You think you can see everything, don't you? The Great Danton is a blind fool. His notebook. You stole it? I borrowed it for tonight. I thought you could translate some of it... I can't. No one can. It's a cipher. Even with the keyword, it will take months to decode. - And without the keyword? - Perhaps never. - We'll see. - We will not see. If I don't get that back by tomorrow he'll know I took it. - Leave him. - I can't. He knows where I live. This is his diary, Olivia. All of his secrets are right here in my hands. It won't bring your wife back. I don't care about my wife. I care about his secret. Look, I'll, um... I'll go to his workshop and stage a break-in. - He'll know you took it. - Yes, me. Not you. Understand? Robert. I have fallen in love with him. Then I know how hard this has been for you. Notebook? Then he's just getting started. Professor! Good evening. I'm walking tonight. Let him come. I don't care. Professor! Professor! Ahh! - You all right? - I'm alive. Saves me cutting you an air hole. - I'm impressed. - Why is that? You're finally getting your hands dirty. It's what a good trick costs, Angier. Risk, sacrifice. The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is all gonna be yours, unless you give me what I want. - Which is? - Your secret. My secret? Your method for The Transported Man. Fallon wouldn't tell me. He doesn't talk at all. - You have my notebook. - Useless without the keyword. Write down your method, Mr. Borden, describe it in full. I want the whole method, not the keyword. I don't know if your secret's in your notebook. The keyword is the method. Where's my ingénieur? - Alive? - How fast can you dig? Fallon, you hear me? Fallon! - How's the arm? - Still attached. Did you find your answer? Our answer, Cutter. I haven't looked yet. I wanted you to share this. I already know how he does it, Robert. Same way he always has, the same way as we do. It's just that you want something more. Well, let's find out then, shall we? What does it mean? It means, Cutter, we have a journey ahead of us. - To America. - Robert? Listen to me. Obsession is a young man's game. Come on. I can't follow you any further in it. I can't, I'm sorry. Then the rest is up to me. I'm sorry. Good evening. Hello, darling. Champagne, your finest. I didn't know we were going to be joined for dinner. Absolutely, we are celebrating. Miss Wenscombe, Mr. Fallon. - What are we celebrating? - We've hit upon a new trick. - Haven't we? - What trick, Freddie? Yes, Freddie, what trick? I am going to bury myself alive every night, and then someone will come along and dig me up. Wonderful. - I think he's had quite enough... - No, pour the champagne. Pour the... Sarah, don't talk to me like that. I'm not a bloody child. - Perhaps it would be better... - Mr. Fallon, escort her home. - My husband's being a bore. - Oh, please. - I see no reason you should suffer. - Don't ruin this evening. Good night, Mrs. Borden. Good night, Freddie. - Freddie? - That's my name. - Not at home. - I'm not always at home, am I? Couldn't you have at least taken off the beard? Sarah, I just came from the bloody theater just now. All right? I'm out in public. Everybody else loves it. Why are you being like this? I had a terrible ordeal today. I thought that something very precious... ...had been lost to me. So I just wanted to celebrate just a little. All right, what? What did you lose? I see, more secrets. Sarah, secrets are my life. - Our life. - No, Alfred, stop, this isn't you. Stop performing. I thought I had the place to myself. Unexpected guests, not very polite. A lot of questions. At first, I thought they worked for the government. - No? - Worse, they work for Thomas Edison. Today, a most curious development. His assistant came to us with a proposition. Obviously, Angier has sent her and told her to admit as much. Does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage? He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've come to offer you his. This is the truth... ...is it? No, that's what he told me to tell you. The truth... ...is that I loved him and I stood by him and he sent me to you, like he would send a stagehand to pick up his shirts. I hate him for that. I could spot Angier's methods from the back of the theater. So, what could you possibly have to offer me? You may know his tricks, but you can't understand why no one sees yours are better. You hide this. I had to look very closely to spot it during The Transported Man, but this makes you unique. It shows you aren't using a double. You mustn't hide it. You must display it proudly. I'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand. Yeah, it does. So let people know. You can be so much more than he is and I can show you how. I think she's telling the truth. I think we cannot trust her. But I love her. I need her. To open myself to such a relationship, to the dangers of such an affair, I need assurances of fidelity, of love. But how to be sure? I know a way. It's the only way to know her mind. How could he send you away? She must help me rid ourselves of Angier. Today, my mistress proves her truthfulness. Not to me, you understand. I've been convinced since she led me to Root. Today, Olivia proves her love for me to you, Angier. Yes, Angier, she gave you this notebook at my request. And yes, ""Tesla"" is merely the key to my dairy, not to my trick. You really think I'd part with my secret so easily after so much? Goodbye, Angier. May you find solace for your forward ambition back in your American home. Tesla! Tesla! Alley! Alley! Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for. - I never said he had. - You let me believe that he had. You stole my money because your funding was cut off. You've been shooting sparks in my top hat, laughing at me all along, while using my money to stave off ruin. - I have seen Edison's men. - Where? In the hotel, I have a mind to bring them up here. That would be unwise, Mr. Angier. It is true that you are our last remaining financier, but we have not stolen your money. This is my cat. When I told you I could make you a machine, I spoke a truth. Why isn't it working? Because exact science, Mr. Angier, is not an exact science. The machine simply does not operate as expected. - It requires further examination. - So where did my top hat go? Nowhere. We tried the damn thing a dozen times. The hat went nowhere. We need to try different material. It may provoke a different result. Great. You are responsible for whatever happens to this animal, doctor. I hope whatever you were really doing with my money was more worthwhile, Mr. Tesla. Alley! So the machine was working? I never checked the calibration, 'cause the hat never moved. These things never quite work as you expect them to. That's one of the principal beauties of science. I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out the problems with the machine. We'll send word when it's ready. Don't forget your hat. - Well, which one is mine? - They are all your hats. You look so pretty in this new dress of yours. - Are we going to the zoo? - No, Daddy has some errands to run. - But you promised. - I promised, did I? Then go to the zoo, we shall. Daddy will go run his errands, and I'll be back before you know it. So you go get ready. We'll go see those chimpanzees. Sarah... what are you doing? Each of us have our vices. Sarah, whatever you may think... ...your only competition for my affections is our little girl. I love you. I will always love you and you alone. - You mean it today. - Absolutely. Which makes it so much harder when you don't. More shopping. She does love the smell of money. The little lady wants to go to the zoo, so I thought you could take her, yeah? I mean, I can do it tomorrow, if not. And, uh... Sarah, she knows. Uh, at least she knows that something is not right, so if you can just do whatever you can to help me. Talk to her, just convince her that I do love her. What is it, Freddie? Listen, don't call me that, please. It's nothing. It's just that sometimes it seems wrong. I told you, when you're with me, you're with me. Leave your family at home where they belong. I'm trying. I'm trying, Olivia. - I'll get dressed. - Yeah. I saw Fallon hanging around again. There's something about that man I don't trust. You trust me? Then trust Fallon. He protects the things that I care about. We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier. We were sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave, as well. He's very good to Colorado Springs. Mr. Angier, I didn't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box. What box? I apologize for leaving without saying goodbye. But I seem to have outstayed my welcome in Colorado. The truly extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry. Perhaps you'll find more luck in your field, where people are happy to be mystified. You will find what you are looking for in this box. Alley has written you a thorough set of instructions. I add only one suggestion on using the machine. Destroy it. Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean. Such a thing will bring you only misery. Tesla's warning is as unheeded as he knew it would be. Today I tested the machine. Taking precautions in case Tesla hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation. But if it went wrong, I would not want to live like that for long. But here at the turn, I must leave you, Borden. Yes, you, Borden, sitting there in your cell, reading my diary, awaiting your death, for my murder. Angier's journal, that gesture of good faith, that's a fake. I assure you, it's not. The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt. And it's written in Angier's own hand, for which we have numerous examples. It don't matter. So my tricks. - All of them. - Including The Transported Man? - Lord Caldlow will be very pleased. - No, he won't. They're not complete. It's just the pledge and the turn for each. Without the prestige for these tricks, these are worthless. Yeah. You get the rest of it... when you bring my daughter here. I want to say goodbye. We have to go through it now. We have to go through it now. Now, listen to me, deny it all you want. Olivia means nothing. - Olivia? - I need an assistant. - I'll go to her, I'll tell her. - You'll tell her what? I know what you really are, Alfred. - I know. - Sarah, Sarah, Sarah. - I can't keep it in. - You can't talk like this. - No. No. - Sarah, shut up! Sarah, shut up! I don't want to hear it anymore. You can't talk like this. You can't hide it anymore, because I know, Alfred, I know. I know what you really are, Alfred. I can't live like this. Oh, well, you think I can live like this? You think I bloody enjoy living like this? We have this beautiful house, lovely little girl, we're married. What is so wrong with your life? Alfred, I can't live like this! Well, what do you want from me? I... I want... I want you to be... honest with me. No tricks. No lies. And no secrets. Do you... do you love me? Not today. No. Who's there? I'm looking for an old friend. I heard about a booking, nice little theater, - good up-and-coming magician. - You're back. It's good to see you, John. Good rehearsal space. Blind stagehands, I like it. You always had a good eye for publicity. I need your help, John. It's my last show. A limited engagement. Your last show? A wise man once told me obsession was a young man's game. I'm almost done. There's one thing left. The Real Transported Man. You want to design a show around it? I don't want you backstage I need you in front managing. Call in any favors or connections you have left to get us the right booking. What sort of booking you after? The sort that Borden can't ignore. Oh, what an honor it is to see you again, sir. You told me you only wanted to show me one trick that'd pique my interest. - It's a very clever trick. - Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ackerman. Likewise, I'm sure. Let's get on, shall we? Turn it on, gentlemen. Very pretty. That's it, Cutter? He simply disappears? That's not a trick. He has to come back. - There has to be a... - A prestige? Exactly. Pardon me. It's very rare to see... ...real magic. It's been many years since... Are you interested in helping us? Yes... but you'll have to dress it up a little. Disguise it. Give them enough reason to doubt it. You haven't spoken about her, Freddie, not once. Why would I talk about her to you, hm? Because she was a part of your life and now she's gone. You know, the day before she killed herself she said she wanted to meet me. That she had something to tell me about you. I was such a coward, I couldn't bring myself to face her. But... ...what would she have said? You want to know the truth about me? The truth is that... ...I never loved Sarah. I never loved her. You married her, you had a child with her. Yes. Part of me. Part of me did, but... ...the other part didn't. The part that found you, the part that's sitting here right now. I love you. No, Olivia, I love you. That's the truth. That is the truth that matters. You could be in some other restaurant with some other woman right now, talking about me that way. - No. - Yes. It's inhuman to be so cold. He's back. After two years, he's got a new trick. They're saying it's the best London's ever seen. You should see the look on your face, Professor. You should go to him. You two deserve each other. But I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow Ballet plays through next year. Then get rid of them. There will be performances, no more, no less. Five performances a week, no matinees. That's what you'll charge for each ticket. Good day. Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of the evening involves considerable risk. Anyone in the audience who would be irrevocably damaged by seeing a man drown should leave now. When I tell you the lady who taught me this illusion actually died performing it, you'll understand the seriousness of the dangers involved. Let's begin. In my travels, I have seen the future. And it is a strange future, indeed. The world, ladies and gentlemen, is on the brink of new and terrifying possibilities. What you're about to witness is not magic. It's purely science. I'd like to invite you to come up on stage now so that you can examine the machine for yourselves. Man's reach exceeds his imagination. Bravo! One hundred performances. Why? Does his method dictate that? Is it a publicity move? What is it? He's a no-talent magician, and they call him the bloody best in England. Why? Fifty yards in a second! In a second! And all that we know is he uses a trap door. Brilliant! What is going on under that stage? Huh?! Why can't you out-think him? They do this every night, after each performance. Yeah? Huh. We're done. All right? Let him have his trick. I don't need his secret. So... ...don't go back there, you leave him alone. Both of us... just leave him alone. We're done. I told you, John. I don't want you backstage on this one. I would like to invite you onstage now so that you can examine the machine for yourselves. - Hey, where do you think...? - I'm part of the bloody act, you fool. Who was that? Hey! Where's the bloody key?! Where's the bloody key?! Where's the bloody key?! He's bloody drowning! Hold on! What have you done? Alfred Borden, you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier. You will be hanged by the neck until dead. May the Lord have mercy on your soul. Mr. Cutter? Owens. Oh, thank you for coming, Mr. Owens. It has fallen to me to dispose of Mr. Angier's equipment. But I notice from this manifest that Lord Caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items. Mr. Cutter, if you need to know where to deliver these items... No, it's just there is one particular item, this item, in fact, - I would like to... - You would like to... ...buy. - Buy yourself? - Yeah, I suppose so. - This is the machine? - Yes. Well, I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant about purchasing this particular item. Do you think I could talk to Lord Caldlow in person? Out of the question, I'm afraid. Of course, I suppose if, in the course of your delivery arrangements, your paths were to cross, I can't stop you speaking your mind. Thank you. - Still here, Borden? - For now. You got a visitor. Lord Caldlow. With a little girl. Jess? Hello, my love. How are you? I've missed you so much. Fallon's missed you too. We both have. Daddy, can I come in there? Not right now. Not right now, darling. No, but everything is gonna be all right. You must be Lord Caldlow? Caldlow. Yes, I am. I always have been. They flatter you with all those chains. Don't they know you can't escape without your rubber ball? I pulled you out... out of that tank. All I wanted to do was prove that I was a better magician. But you couldn't leave me alone. I don't know what you've done. But you're not afraid to get your hands dirty anymore, are you? No, not anymore. And I win. No one cares about the man in the box, the man who disappears. You win? This ain't a bloody competition anymore. This is my little girl's life. And don't you dare put her in the middle of this. Oh, I know how hard it is to have someone so special taken away from you, don't I, Borden? And you can't take it with you, now, can you? Oh, she'll be looked after. Goodbye, Professor. Come on, darling. No, no, no, no, stop, my darling. Look, here. That's what you're after. That's what this is about. Take it. - Your secret? - Yeah. You always were the better magician. We both know that. Whatever your secret was, you have to agree, mine is better. Don't do this. Don't do this, Angier. Jess, Jess! Jess, I'm gonna take you home soon. I promise. - For God's sake. - I promise. Look! I promise. I love you, Jess. I love you. - Come on. - I love you. I love you, Jess. Angier! Angier! What, do you think this place can hold me? Angier! They're gonna bloody hang me! And you can put a stop to this now! Listen! Listen! That man... Listen, that man is the one I'm in for killing! Listen! If he's alive, I'm not guilty! - I'm not guilty! - I don't care! - Get hold of him. - Angier! Run along now. Sir, there's a gentleman waiting. - Dear God. - Hello, Cutter. You're still alive. How is it you're still alive? I saw you on a slab, for God's sake. - Child. - Good night, sir. Good night, Jess. I've seen her before. I saw her in court with... ...Fallon. - What have you done? - She needs looking after. She needs her father. You're letting him hang, and I helped you. I came here to beg Lord Caldlow to let me destroy that machine. I am not going to beg you for anything. You don't have to. I'm gonna make sure it is never used again. Then, Lord Caldlow... ...where do you want me to deliver it? My theater. It belongs with the prestige materials. John, I tried not to involve you. So... We go alone now. Both of us. I mean, I don't have as far to go as you. No. You were right. I should have left him to his damn trick. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for a lot of things. I'm sorry about Sarah. Didn't mean to hurt her, I didn't. You go live your life in full now, all right? You live for both of us. Goodbye. Are you watching closely? Put it down on the end. Take a minute to consider your achievement. I once told you about a sailor who described drowning to me. Yes, he said it was like going home. I was lying. He said it was agony. Alfred Borden, this day, in the name of the king and the High Court of England, you will meet your end. No one cares about the man in the box. Cutter? Cutter! Do you have anything to say? Abracadabra. A brother? A twin? You were Fallon. - The whole time? - No. We were both Fallon. We were both Borden. Were you the one who went into the box? Or the one who came back out? We took turns. The trick is where we would swap. Cutter knew. Cutter knew. But I told him it was too simple, too easy. No. Simple, maybe, but not easy. There's nothing easy about two men sharing one life. I don't understand, how it can be bleeding again? Wha... What about Olivia and your wife? We each loved one of them. I loved Sarah. He loved Olivia. We each had half of a full life, really, which was enough for us... ...just. But not for them. See, sacrifice, Robert, that's the price of a good trick. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? I've... I've made sacrifices. - No. - Yes. It takes nothing to steal another man's work. Yeah, it takes everything. No, no, wait, I'm not... It took courage. It took courage to climb into that machine every night, not knowing... ...if I'd be the man in the box... ...or in the prestige. Do you want to see... ...what it cost me? You didn't see where you are, did you? Look. Look. I don't care. You went halfway around the world. You spent a fortune. You did terrible things. Really terrible things, Robert. And all for nothing. For nothing? Yeah. You never understood... ...why we did this. The audience knows the truth. The world is simple. It's miserable. Solid... Solid all the way through. But if you could fool them, even for a second... ...then you could make them wonder. And then you... Then you got to see something very special. You really don't know. It was... ...it was the look on their faces. Every magic trick consists of three parts, or acts. The first part is called ""the pledge."" The magician shows you something ordinary. The second act is called ""the turn."" The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it into something extraordinary. But you wouldn't clap yet, because making something disappear isn't enough. You have to bring it back. Now you're looking for the secret. But you won't find it, because, of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to work it out. You want to be fooled."
44,2011,The Sitter,American,"The film opens with Noah Griffith (Jonah Hill) giving oral sex to his sex buddy Marisa (Ari Graynor). Noah is a suspended college student who lives with his divorced mother and can't even keep a job.
One day when Noah is returning home from his girlfriend's house, his mother is about to leave to a party with a friend of hers. His mother then receives a phone call from her friend who informs her that her children's babysitter canceled last minute. Noah then takes over as babysitter so his mother can go to the party.
When Noah arrives at the house, he meets all of the kids immediately. The oldest son Slater (Max Records) is a kid with a severe anxiety disorder, their second oldest son Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) is a pyromaniac who was adopted from El Salvador. The youngest child is their daughter Blithe (Landry Bender) who is obsessed with pop culture and loves to wear makeup. As soon as the Pedulas leave, the children start to act obnoxious (smashing vases, making fart noises, and attempting to grab the TV remote from Noah).
While in the middle of babysitting, Marisa calls Noah and she asks him to bring cocaine for a party that she's at, saying that she'll repay him with sex afterwards. Noah immediately accepts, and he and the children leave to go get the drugs from Marisa's friend. When they finally arrive, Noah meets drug dealer Karl (Sam Rockwell) and his assistant Julio (JB Smoove). As soon as Karl gives the drugs to Noah, Rodrigo bursts in claiming that he has to go to the bathroom. When Noah leaves, he sees that Rodrigo has stolen a baby dinosaur egg filled with cocaine from Karl's house. While attempting to get the egg back from Rodrigo, the egg smashes pouring cocaine all over Noah's face.
Karl then calls Noah about the stolen eggs, and tells him that if he doesn't bring the egg back or the $10,000 he owes for the egg, he will kill him.
Not wanting to be a part of this, Slater asks Noah to take the three of them to the party where their parents are. When Noah sees his mother actually having a good time at the party he can't bring himself to interfere and decides to bring the kids with him. Slater then tells Noah that a bunch of girls are texting him asking him to attend a bat mitzvah for Wendy Sapperstein (a girl that goes to his school). He tells Noah that the bat mitzvah is being held at the Grand Prospect Hall. Noah then comes up with the idea that they can steal the money Wendy gets.
At the bat mitzvah, Noah manages to only steal $3,000 because he had to leave due to Rodrigo urinating on the floor. When they leave, they find out that Tina (Samira Wiley), who went to high school with Noah, has stolen the car to get revenge on Noah who went to a party at her house, and threw up on her grandmother's ashes due to him being drunk. Noah gives the $3,000 to Karl and also brings $7,000 worth of checks. Karl refuses the checks and gives Noah one more chance at getting the $7,000. He tells Noah to meet him at the party Marisa is at with the money and if he doesn't, he will kill him.
Noah then goes to his dad (Bruce Altman) for help, but he refuses because he now hates Noah due to him dropping out of college and just being a loser in general. An angry Noah steals his father's car keys and drives to a jewelry store his dad owns. Noah then steals enough jewelry to pay back Karl, but then Rodrigo blows the store up after placing a cherry bomb in the bathroom. Rodrigo then throws a temper tantrum, and then throws Slater's fanny pack containing pills out the window. Noah stops the car so Slater can get the pills. Noah tells Slater that he's not going to find them, and it is then revealed that Slater is homosexual, and the pills were the only thing that kept him ""normal."" Noah then makes Slater accept the fact that he's gay, and that there is nothing wrong with it.
The group then sees their original car drive by them, and they track it down to a club where Noah confronts Tina about stealing the car. Tina finally let's go of her anger towards Noah by punching him in the face. After Noah leaves, they go head out to get the money to Karl but Noah gets pulled over by the police who steal the jewelry and the cocaine that Karl originally gave him. Noah's only plan now is to get Marisa out of the party and escape Karl, but Karl's gang tracks him down and attempts to kill Noah and the kids, but Noah manages to get away. Then Noah engages in a car chase with Karl and Julio. They make Karl's car crash by Rodrigo throwing a cherry bomb in their van, but this causes Noah to spin out, and Karl holds him at gunpoint.
Noah manages to run away and Karl uses up all his ammo wasting it on shooting at Noah. Then, Blithe calls Tina's gang, and they beat Karl up so they can escape.
Before Noah drops Marisa off at her house, the two break up. Noah then manages to get the kids home on time, and they see that everything that went on that night is on the news. Mr. and Mrs. Pedula finally arrive home, and they pay Noah for the night.
During the end credits, we find out what happens to all the main characters: Noah got a new girlfriend; Slater grew up and got a job at the entertainment industry; Blithe gave up her pop culture obsession, and started inventing perfumes as an adult; Rodrigo gave up being a pyromaniac; Karl was hospitalized after being beat up by Tina's gang; and Julio died due to him burning to death.",5.6,tt1366344,"Subtitle OCR Conversion by Halofubar GIRL MOANING Come inside, take off your coat I'll make you feel at home GIRL BREATHING HEAVILY Now let's pour a glass of wine 'Cause now we 're all alone GIRL CONTINUES MOANING Oh. my God!

I'm getting kind of sick of going to your house all the time and watching tennis. We do other shit. No, we don't! You don't do anything! I can't just always hang around you. I don't get why you're being mean to me. He doesn't want to hang out with you any more, bro. How hard is it to understand that? Just stop calling and texting him all the time. it's weird. Is that true? See you around. Yo. Hey, man. You all right? - Those guys fucking with you? - Yeah, I'm fine. - You okay? - Yeah, just leave me alone! Hi. I'm so sorry to have to say this to you.

I'll just alert my team of scientists, have them invent a new perfume. We'll start selling it and we'll have seven grand in the next minutes! - You're such a jerk. - God damn it, my fucking shin. I'm just trying to help. All I know is, is I'm going to be a famous celebrity who designs on the side, and I'm going to be rich. What the hell are you talking about? You do know that just being a celebrity and having a good time is not a real job, right? Yeah, it is! Being a famous celebrity is the greatest thing in the world! It means people take your picture. You get to have birthday parties at the coolest clubs and dance on tables. Even for a small child, you sound like an idiot. NOAH SIGHS What are you walking away for? What's your problem, drama queen? My problem is that my best friend Clayton doesn't want to hang out with me any more because he doesn't like me back, and he'd rather hang out with an asshole named Benji Gillespie.

Because you fucked my dad while he was still married to my mom and ruined my life. I forgot! Is he home, by the way? Seven thousand dollars? Yes. There is no way in hell I'm giving you seven grand, so... Dad, you screwed Mom and I out of child support and alimony. Just do this one thing. We'll call it even. All right? You know, I have to say, it is always some justification with you. You are never gonna grow up with that attitude. Okay, don't do that. Don't do that. Okay? Don't pretend like you care how I turn out. Let's be very, very straightforward with one another. - Okay? - Okay, I'm in a jam. Okay? That's why I'm here, because I need your help. And I'm sorry. I just need you to be my dad for a day. That's it. And I'm sorry. I can't help you. You know what, pal? it's not my problem. I mean, it's really not my problem. Okay. Daddy? Can we look at the telescope now? JIM: Oh, hey, buddy. Of course. Excuse me a second. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to go in the kitchen and get a little bite to eat for the two of us. I'll be right in, okay? That a boy! There's a geomagnetic storm tonight I forgot. I got thrown off. - So... - I didn't even know. Yeah, I have to go. You smell like perfume. You got a lot of perfume on you. I know. I know I do. Why? Gotcha, bitch. BLITHE: Shotgun! NOAH: All right, come on, let's go! Let's roll. Hustle. Rodrigo, feel free to take a piss in it. BLITHE: Fancy car. It smells like hotdogs. Was that woman at the door your babysitter? She was, till I found out my dad was tipping her extra when he'd drive her home at night. SLATER: Where are we going? NOAH: Just got to pick up something from my dad's store real quick. You're breaking in? - Not exactly. -ALARM RINGING BLITHE: Shouldn't you tell him about this or something? SLATER: What's wrong?

Okay? The code's my birthday. It's always been my birthday. He didn't change it. Maybe it's someone else's birthday. ALARM STOPS RINGING Sorry, man. Let me guess what it is. BEEPS Booyah! Can I tell you my gossip now? Oh, shit, yeah. Blithe. Not now. I think we should go, okay? Let's go. We gotta go. I saw my daddy kissing his assistant, Debra. That's why he always stays late at the hospital, 'cause he spends all night kissing Debra. My mom knows. She pretends like she doesn't know, but she knows. That's not gossip, Blithe. You know that, right? Well... Sometimes people do messed-up stuff to each other, okay? Why? One time I was walking down the street, I punched my best friend Darius in the nut sack for no reason. Just both fists. - Just double-punched him. - Why would you do that? I don't know. You're an idiot. That's probably true. I am an idiot. And so is your dad. Come on. Hey. Where's Rodrigo? He's in the bathroom. TOILET FLUSHING OMINOUS COWBOY MUSIC PLAYING Oh, no. No, tell me... Tell me you didn't. CHUCKLING Oh, shit! - Why the hell did you do that, Rodrigo? - BLITHE: Seriously, dude! You said you didn't have any more cherry bombs! How many more do you have, huh? You can't just go around blowing up bathrooms! it's not cool! Why can't you be more like your brother and sister? They're at least half crazy. You're full-on nuts! They are not my brother and sister! They are nothing to me! They are not my family! She does nothing all day but paint her face like a puta. She is a puta! And this one is sick in the head! He goes to the head doctor four times a week! SPEAKING SPANISH - Hey! Stop acting crazy, okay? - He is the crazy one. He has this medicine! He loco! He muy loco! - Hey, relax! - Shut up! You shut up with your stupid fanny pack! I take your fanny pack! No! No! No, I need that! Stop it! I need that! My pills! No! No! NOAH: What did you do that for? - SLATER: Pull over! Pull over! - Okay! Okay! SLATER: Right now! Right now! NOAH: Okay! Okay! Slater! Where are you going? What the fuck is your problem, man? SPEAKS SPANISH NOAH: Slater. You're not going to find it, all right? - I need those pills, okay? I need them. - No, you don't. Yes, I do, okay? I have serious issues. You don't have serious issues. Yes, I do! Those pills are the only thing that keep me normal, and I need them! I can't do this any more. Slater, you're gay, all right? What the fuck are you talking about? - Nothing. Never mind. - Take that back! Take it back, Noah! You're gay. All right? You're as queer as a football bat, and that's fine. And if your therapist hasn't clued you into that by now, then you should ask for your money back, pal. You ever think the reason you're so upset your buddy Clayton doesn't want to hang out any more is because you have a lot of special feelings for him that maybe he doesn't feel back? It breaks your heart, man. And that breaks my heart. 'Cause I know what that feels like. I feel it all the time. I don't want to be gay! I'm not gay! Tough. I don't want to be a faggot! Hey! Do not say shit like that! Do you understand me? This is the worst night of my life. All right, high school is going to suck. Coming out to your parents, it's not gonna be a picnic, either. But trust me when I tell you that when you get to college, nobody will care. And then, when you graduate college, you'll get an awesome job in the entertainment industry. You'll be super-organized and dress really well, you'll smell good. Smell good? What are you talking about, Noah? Relax. Listen to me. My dad hates me. All right? I got kicked out of college. SIGHING Before tonight, this babysitting thing, I've only ever had one job, and I was a lifeguard. I got fired after four days because I kept falling asleep in the sun. I'm a constant disappointment to my mom, who's the only decent person in my life. I've been arrested numerous times. I had a month-long, intense addiction to Robitussin. There's only one freak out here. You're looking at him. I've never had a gay thought in my life, so what does that tell you? That tells me you're pretty messed up. I have seen Devil Wears Prada about times, but that's because it's a good movie. It's a good flick. Devil Wears P. You ever seen it? D Wears P? I think, like, once. I don't really remember it though. Nothing's wrong with you. You're normal. Just super gay. You're a dick. LAUGHS Yes, that's true. Enough of the pills, all right? Okay. You know, deep down, I think I always kind of knew. SIGHS But don't tell anybody yet, okay? I won't. I won't. What do you think I am, an asshole? LAUGHING Yeah, sort of. Come on, Ricky Martin, let's get out of here. SLATER: That's an example. Hey, Slater, are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Hey! That's Mom's car! NOAH: Are you sure? BEEPING All right. Let's go! Let's go! BLITHE: Rodrigo's jacket must be in there! PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY BLITHE: This is my kind of club. SLATER: Let's just go home. NOAH: No. All right? I have a half-hour to get to this party, pay off Karl, pick my girlfriend up off the floor, get you kids home, and be home in time for my mom to tell me how awesome her night was. I'm not gonna let some bullshit car thief fuck this up for me. Hey. What's happening, my man? How you doing, man? You know, this ain't no place for no kids. These aren't kids, these are little people. This woman's years old. Her children have children. - Hi. I'm a grandma. - All right. - What's your name, baby? - They call me Soul, Soul Baby. Soul Baby?

My brother. - Treat it, don't beat it, my man. - All right, baby. You're a badass motherfucker. MUSIC PLAYING - Hey. -GROANS God, man. What's up, white boy? I'm here for my minivan. What's up?

This ain't where you belong! All right, you're going to listen to me, okay? You're right, I threw up in your grandmother's ashes. - Hell, yeah, you did. - It was an accident. - Fucked up. - I apologize from the bottom of my heart. I have been stuck babysitting these three kids. I was talked into buying cocaine for my girlfriend, who I realize is not even my girlfriend. She's just a girl who occasionally lets me stick my face in her crotch -and who's mean to me all the time. Okay? -ALL LAUGH And this time, making her happy is probably gonna get me killed. You're acting all gangster, stealing cars, hanging out with thugs. Well, you know what? A few years ago we went to the same lame-ass high school. The point is, you and I are two fucked-up kids meeting on the playground. I came here for my motherfucking keys to my motherfucking minivan, and that's what's up! ALL LAUGHING Is that supposed to be a threat, little man? I ain't giving you shit. It's not a threat. I'm going to put both my hands behind my back, and you get one punch to my face as hard as you want. - I can punch you in the face? - You deserve to punch me in the face. Go on, baby. Punch him in the face. WHISPERS My face is ready to receive you. - Noah, don't! - What? CROWD: Oh! TINA: Bitch. - BLITHE: Noah! - I fucking love you right now. You killed my babysitter! Noah?

Unlock it. What's inside? Oh, shit, it's a bomb. Hell, yeah. I feel that. NOAH: Let that debris fall across your face, girl. Look here, little homey. I like your style, you dig? I appreciate that. Thank you. You stand up for yours, and I can respect that. If we ever need a crazy-ass white boy to roll with us one day and get punched in the face by motherfuckers, I'm-a call you. - Know what I mean? - Yeah, man. Yo, listen. Listen. Let me holler at you for a second. I just wanna let you know, I just want to throw a monster shout-out back at you, my man. Monster shout-out back at me, right? I don't understand what the fuck that is, but it sound good, though. - It's all good, baby. - All right, brother. Peace to you. I fucking love you, dawg. Noah, are you all right? HOARSELY I feel so cool right now. LAUGHING This place is cool. I honestly might start DJ-ing here. I don't know. Okay, that's all right, but do you really think that this is an appropriate place to bring kids? I don't know. Look, Rodrigo's over there chatting up some prostitutes. You got Slater schooling Bell Biv DeVoe over there in pool. And Blithe's doing the Riverdance over in the bowling alley. Honestly, this is the first time I've seen them having any kind of fun, so what the hell? You know what that is? What is that? Just me being cool. Playing it cool. No big deal. You're crazy. You're crazy slash beautiful. Whatever. So, did you drive here? No, I took a cab. Maybe you should take my dad's car, because I can't drive both of them anyways. Are you serious? Yeah, it'd actually really help me out. Okay. How are you gonna find me? Do you have a phone? Okay. See you. - Yeah. LAUGHS - Just kidding. Here, this is my phone number, and then you can call me. Okay. I'll call you. Hey. Why did you say something to me when you saw me earlier? I feel like you kind of ignored me all freshman year. I don't know. I thought you were really funny and smart and seemed really sweet. I guess I was kind of nervous to talk to you back then. You were nervous to talk to me? Yeah. MOBILE RINGING My phone's ringing. Shit, it's my girlfriend. I'm sorry. I have to take this. - Girlfriend. - Yeah. Hello? All right. See you later. Call me about the car. - Yeah. - Noah. NOAH: Listen tome.

I will. God bless you. God bless you. Father. God bless... Thank you. Let's do this. Why don't we put our lists together? We'll split them up and work down. L-I got to call you back. They just picked up somebody in Oak Cliff. They think he's the shooter. Shot and killed the same time as the President We now have the name of that suspect who has been picked up by Dallas, Texas police in connection with the slaying of a Dallas policeman. The story says the Dallas Police Department has arrested a year old man identified as Lee H. Oswald in connection with the slaying of a Dallas policeman shortly after President Kennedy was assassinated. Oswald is also being interrogated to see if he had any connection with the slaying of the President. Did you hear that? I did hear that. Oswald was pulled screaming and yelling, from the Texas Theater in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas. This story does not say that Oswald is the man wanted in connection with the slaying of the President. It says that he is wanted in connection... Is he talking about your brother? Bob? Is that your brother? I have to go home. has been apprehended. Police are apparently questioning both of them now. J- Edgar Hoover has ordered the full FBI... What are you saying? Oh, Christ. Jim. Just a minute. Wait. What? What are you looking for? Lee Harvey Oswald. What is this? Why do you have this? Why the hell do you... This has got to be the guy. Why the hell do we have this? This guy works in the Depository. Yeah, a hundred feet from where the President was shot. For how long? I don't know. A month? What do you mean, a month? How do you know this? 'Cause I'm tracking him. Tracking him? Jesus! For how long? months. Found W. Come here. Hosty's been tracking him months. What the hell for? You know, I couldn't even tell you. He's just a sorry son of a bitch. He's one of these guys who says he's a Marxist, then he's a revolutionary. Revolutionary? For who? Nobody. Nobody wants this guy. He defected to the Soviets a couple years back. Now he's here? They didn't want him. Tried to off himself there They said he could stay as long as he didn't die. And I guess he got bored with that, came back. Fain did the follow up interviews on it. Yeah, a couple of them. Figured there was nothing there so he closed the file. It was right before he retired. Wife's Russian, so I checked up on her. Oswald was knocking her around some. That's why I put him back on the active list. You actually interview him? No, he was never around. When was the last time you tried? Two weeks ago. Two weeks ago? Yeah. I saw the wife. Saw the wife. Well, today... her husband killed the President. Which one is Sorrels? I am. This is Secret Service business. Let me see it. F 1.8 zoom lens set for full close up. So, can you do it? mil is tricky. There's always a risk with new technology. A risk of what? mil is really mil split in two. Each frame is really four frames together. Two running one way, two running the other. It means twice the risk of overexposure or destruction. And there's always a percentage of the film partially or fully destroyed in the process. Have you done much of this type of thing? Three, maybe four times. And how'd that go? Look we can still send it to Rochester if you want. We need to know who's behind this. We don't have that kind of time. Listen, I'm temporarily transferring possession to you. Nobody looks at it until we do, and nobody talks about what's on there. Mr. Zapruder. Is that okay with you? Yes. Okay. You okay? I'm upset. We're all upset. Latest news from Dallas. Vice-President Johnson is being rushed to the security of Air Force One for an emergency return to Washington. Nobody knows at this hour if the shooting is part of a wider plot or the act of one assassinator. In Washington, nuclear missile silos are being prepared. Polaris submarine remain deployed, and the United States Air Force around the globe is on high alert. I have to go. We may have the shooter. Do not screw me, Harry! I don't want, what's on that film all over the papers. Film stays with Zapruder. No matter what anybody says, no matter what's on it, film doesn't leave you. Volunteer returning to Angel! We're leaving now! Let's go! Everyone ready? You all know what's on here, right? And you're sure you're ready? I'm ready. That's my granddaughter. I'm sorry. I forgot. My grandson. It's your life, Mr. Zapruder. Looks like a good life. Oh, God. My God. You have everything. You have the whole god damn thing. Oh, my God. We're going to need some copies of that. I don't have the right machinery. You're going to have to go somewhere else. Mr. Zapruder. I wish you luck, sir. Do not stop! Go, go, go! All clear! This way, sir. Go! Go, go! Who are they? Dallas police and the FBI. You sure attract a crowd. He can ride with me. He came with us. He's leaving with us. Easy. Yeah, he said to meet him here. Gentlemen, thank you very much. We need three copies. One for the Secret Service. One for the FBI, and one for me. Let me through. Excuse me. Hold it. Excuse me. What are you doing? Who are you? I'm the medical examiner. This is a homicide case. The deceased can't leave until there's been an autopsy. This casket cannot leave the premises. I'm the special agent in charge of the White House detail for the Secret Service. That is the President of the United States and we are taking him back to Washington. That's not the way we do things around here. It's a Federal crime. No, it is not. There's no Federal statue. It's a murder, it's local, and it's under local jurisdiction. Earl, be very careful here. That is my body. The President is coming with us. You can't take him. We have laws here in Texas. The law can be waived. Not by me. I can't do it. Earl, let him go. Do you have any idea... any idea how difficult this has been for Mrs. Kennedy? I deal with widows everyday! The remains will stay here. I don't think so. The remains... What did you call it, your body? The hell with you, and the hell with your law. Move it out! The Dallas police is here to execute the laws of the state of Texas! Screw the lid on that coffin now! Let it go. You cannot take it. It's against the law to remove a corpse from the State of Texas without permission! Enough! You cannot fake if. We're leaving. Move! It's okay, Earl. You did right. What a shitty place to die. You're not driving. What are you talking about? Don't. Please, allow me. It's okay. Ma'am. Bob Bugger, ma'am. God bless you. They're five minutes out. Where we putting the coffin? I don't know. I never thought about it. We're not flying it below like a piece of luggage. We're riding it right here. Let's get these two rows of seats off the plane. Look for a tool box. Get some tools up here, and bodies! Six bolts. I need a screwdriver. We got four minutes. Six bolts tie it to the fuselage. You got it? You got them? One, two, three. Go, go, go. Let's go. Watch it. Watch the back. Come on. Come on you guys. Let's just get the hell out of here. All right, come on. Here we go. Keep the back end up. Keep the back end up! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch that corner. You're not going to make it. Let's go. Come on. Push it. All right, come on. Easy. Put it down. Slow... Dear God. This work okay, Dave? This is just fine, Lem. This is the first time the Secret Services has lost a president under its watch. I think it may be months from now. Hello, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm Robert Oswald. The man who shot the President, I'm his brother. Jackie. I will faithfully execute... The office of President of the United States... The office of President of the United States... I will, to the best of my ability... I will, to the best of my ability... - Preserve... - Preserve... - Protect... - Protect... - and defend... - And defend... the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution of the United States. - So help me God. - So help me God. So, you finally bothered to find me. I'll probably starve now. Momma's going to need money. Mother. I am responsible for two presidents. I'm sorry? Kennedy and now President Johnson. I'm not even a Democrat. Come on. Let's go. This room is bugged. Be careful. I don't care. If you know anything about this, I want to know what you know right now. And no damn stories. Well, I always knew Lee was some sort of secret agent. Didn't you? What are you talking about? They recruited him when he was in the Marines. Who's they? And what possibly for? We did. The U.S. government did. He was sent on dangerous missions. The first was to Russia. Okay, okay, let me get this straight. Lee, our Lee... is a super secret government spy? Mm-hmm. Come back from Russia with a year old wife. She doesn't speak English. He can't hold a job. They have two kids and not a pot to piss in. That's impressive. That is a dangerous fellow, Lee. And then what? You know. You're insane. Don't you speak to your mother like that. Lee Harvey Oswald has done more for his country than any other living human being. I will never be ordinary again! I was thinking when I was waiting for you about that book I'm going to write. What book? It will have to be very deeply researched. A publisher, with money, will have to come with a paid writer to do the work. Mother... I just want to make sure you understand what is happening here today. Your son, my brother... has apparently killed the most important person in the world. And if that is true, he is going to die for what he has done. It's my story, too. There he is. There's Oswald. Oswald say, ""I did not shoot anybody."" Hold on. Hold on. I remember this guy. Hey, Adam? What? He was here. Who was here? Oswald was here, in the office. He left something for Hasty. Oh, Christ. Jesus. Mrs. Oswald! Mrs. Oswald! Mrs. Oswald! Did he do it? Mrs. Oswald. Your mother's a piece of work, I'll give her that. I don't know what we're going to do. I've got two kids. Well, we're all fathers. You, me... the police officer your brother shot point blank. The President. Well, they were. If I were you, I'd consider changing my name. I'd pray I never needed the help of the Dallas Police Department or the Federal government again. I'd pack your things and your wife and those two children of yours, and I'd move as far from here as I could. I'd never come back, even to die. But... that's just me. Oswald has been charged with the murder of a police officer. Where the hell have you been? I was out doing my job. Doing your job, huh? What's this? Shit, I get three of these things every week. This one's from Oswald. Oswald left this for you ten days ago. ""You've been talking to my wife Marina and I don't like you. ""You need to stop talking to Marina ""or there will be a price to pay."" I've got of these things. It says that he's going to blow up the office. Three times a week I get shit like this. But this was written by the assassin of the President! And it was delivered to this office in person ten days go, Jim, which means we had the assassin of the President in our office threatening a Federal officer, which is a crime Not ten days ago. We did not have the assassin of the President. For which he could be arrested. We had another goddamn delusional nobody! Yeah, well he's a somebody now! Never said one word about killing the President! No, Only you! Well, if I worried about every son of a bitch who wants to shoot me, I'm in the wrong goddamn business! Listen. The world is not going to care about you. They're going to say that we had him. We had him, and we could have stopped him! Jesus Christ. This might be, probably is, now that I think about it the biggest fuck-up in the history of American law enforcement. Fuck! You, follow me. All right, give me your hands. Need some help with that? No, I got it. I need some help from you to shut up. Sit down, Lee! How are you? I don't think you've ever asked me that question in my life. I'm really confused. Maybe you can tell me what-what... What is going on? I don't know. They have your pistol, they have your rifle, and they've charged you and you're telling me you don't know. God damn it, just tell me what you did. Don't believe all this so-called evidence. What's Marina going to do with the kids now? I don't know. Well, we have friends. Junie needs new shoes. Oh, she needs new shoes. How about a goddamn father? How about a killer for a father? How about the killer of the President for a father? You're worried about shoes. Do you have any idea what you've done? You've ruined that kid's life. Both those kids' lives! So forget the goddamn stupid shoes! Can you hear me? Put' the phone to your ear, all right? Look at me. I'm sorry. Well, I'm going to get you a lawyer. Stay out of it. Stay out of it? My children, my wife, my children's children, all of us, for all of eternity. You did this to all of us. I don't know who you think you are, but I am your brother. And I'll find you an attorney and be back in a day or two. Don't be running back and forth all the time and getting yourself in trouble with your boss. Time to go. What did he say? I don't know. I have no idea who that was. Thank you, sir. It's been ringing all night. Everybody wants that film. Hello? I'd like to speak to Mr. Zapruder, please. This is Abraham Zapruder. My name is Dick Stolley. I'm the editor of Life magazine. I'd like to talk to you tonight about your film. You know what? Not tonight. No. I'm very tired. I'm upset. It's been an upsetting day. I'm sure you can understand. I understand completely, but I need to come see you as soon as possible. Yeah, tomorrow morning, okay. Okay, tomorrow morning then. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. Let's go home, Abe. It's enough. It's enough. MY eyes. We're about to wind this up for tonight, because all that could happen on one day has. For some final reflection on one of the more horrible days in American history, you find there is a great deal that could be said about the political and other changes that we can look forward to now, but I think it' would be bad taste to go into it' now. And I won't. It has all been shocking. By the Washington clock, at a little after one o'clock this afternoon, President Kennedy was alive as any human being ever gets, young, strong, vigorous, looking forward to, no doubt, five more years, he hoped of leadership in this country and of the western world. There is no more news here tonight, and really no more to say, except that was has happened today has been just too much, too ugly, and too fast. Good morning, lam Dr. Perry. What seems to be bothering you? How's our patient doing? Fine. And our resident? Okay, good. Turn off the lights please. Jesus Christ. We blew it. Shut up! Did you see that? Did you see that? We blew it! That wasn't a damn Easter parade, that's the President of the United States! Do you understand me! You think we need your goddamn opinion about anything! No, sir. I've been doing this job for years! I have never lost my man! This was not supposed to happen! Yesterday, I lost my man. Thank you, gentlemen, if you would wait outside for a moment please. Thank you. This is no time to point' fingers. This is a time of... Dick Stolley. Life magazine. We spoke last night. Yeah, I know who you are. My father brought my family over here years ago to escape certain death. We worked hard, built a good, honest life. An American life. Sir, we'd like to talk to you about making a deal. But I guess all of that is over. Nothing is ever going to be the same. I wish I never took this film, Mr. Stolley. But now I'm going to have to live with it. Don '2' make a deal without talking to us first, sir. I admire you, you know. I've been to war. Know what it's like to use a camera. You kept shooting. No, no. It wasn't a war, Mr. Stolley. I filmed a murder. Mr. Zapruder, we're going to slip an offer underneath the door. God, if I open this door, it is going to be impossible for both of us. Don't make me negotiate with those people. Don't make me go out there. Life magazine is just as anxious as you are to give your pictures a respectable display. Mr. Zapruder, CBS. Well, that is why you are standing in this room, Mr. Stolley, because I trust that. I trust your magazine. And I want to say very clearly I know what this is, and what it's done. What it is going to do. So if you want a chance to do the right thing with this film then you're going to have to pay for it. You have to pay to keep it safe and to protect me and my family. I think I understand. And one other thing. When the President is... when he's The kill shot? Yeah. You will publish those frames? Because I think you would agree, some things the world does not need to see. Would you not? Normally yes, but in this case missing frames could lead to false speculation. That is none of my business. I don't... I don't care about all of that. I'm talking about the man's dignity. We have a responsibility. A dignified man, you understand. It's a very undignified end for a very dignified man! You have something to write on? There is the prisoner. There is Lee Harvey Oswald. What'? He has been shot! He's been shot. Lee Oswald has been shot! There's a man with a gun. Oswald has been shot! Right now. Jesus Christ, right on live TV. God damn! Absolute panic here at headquarters. Oswald has been shot. There is no question. Oswald has been shot. Detectives have their guns drawn. We have not heard from Mr. Stolley or his associates at Life magazine since yesterday evening. And Lee Oswald's wife and children and I... are stranded alone at a strange motel in the middle of nowhere. We are waiting to hear about our cash deal. Thank you. I shall be waiting right here. We are the Mrs. Oswalds. We need money. We need a place to stay where we can hide from everyone and we need a new place to live, dear heart. All we do is rush around from one place to another, in the grand exodus. The baby's diapers are wet. We are hungry as all get out. Mother! Hey, Mike. Get out here. Something's going on. They're running around outside. Don't get excited. Lee's been shot. It isn't serious. And they got the man who shot him. Where are they taking him? Parkland. No! He is not living or dying in there. Room two! How many bullets? Where's the respirator? Where's Perry? Gauze. There's Clark. What's the blood pressure? over 85. It's going down. I don't like this. Let's open him up. We're going to need some suction. Get suction ready. From one bullet? Yeah, one point blank. Let's start left, go right. Right kidney gone, spleen gone. We're going to have to get in there. Right there. Need more gauze. Got it. BP over 85. We might get to keep this one. Do we want to? We need a confession. What if he dies? We need a confession first. Don't we all. Damn it! Blood pressure is going down. over 40. We need more blood! Nurse. Zero, nothing. I've got the lung. Massage the heart. Nothing. Adrenalin now. Adrenalin! Come on! All right, Jim hold it right there. Open! Nothing. Jim, paddles! Paddles. Paddles. Paddles. 200. Clear. Nothing. Again. 360. Clear. Nothing. Still nothing. 500. Clear. Nothing. 700. Clear. Time. 1:07. Dammit. Yes, this is Mike Howard. I'm sorry, will you repeat that? Thank you. He's gone? I'm sorry, Robert. Lee was an agent for the U.S. government. He should be buried at Arlington Cemetery with President Kennedy. Shut up, mother. He's staying here. This time, I don't think anyone's going to give you a hard time. Your name is Robert. Is that right, son? That's right. I'm sorry for you. I'm sorry for everybody. -... a brief stop at the White House. Then Mrs. Kennedy followed the casket on foot... to St. Matthews Church. I don't think you all should listen to this. No, please leave it. Thank you. Bring him in. Close the blinds for me. We're getting killed, Jim. What happened in this office... What we did... what you did... What do you want, Gordon? You were in the military, right, Jim? Yeah, Army. Are you firing me? I don't ever want to see that again. What the hell am I supposed to do with it? Oswald's dead now. A thousand what-ifs. 'em. This is evidence. Well it's not evidence if there's no trial. And there sure as shit won't be a trial now. I know what that is, Jim. I'm asking you to destroy it. I think we all know what is at stake here. Wait... You want this? Why aren't we doing this in the church? Well, no church will do it. What about that cemetery chapel over there? They won't allow it either. You only have this grave site because a friend owed me a favor. And I'm sorry, but there are no pallbearers. Can you help us, please? Thank you. The remains of John F. Kennedy are about to pass a memorial to another president. The stamina of this woman... through these past three or four days has been indescribable. I haven '2' done a burial in eight years, but someone has to help this family. God of the open sky and of the infinite universe, we pray and petition for this family who are heartbroken. Those who suffer and in his hearts are full of fears. We'll pray for them. For their need is great. May God have mercy on your soul. or if these dark days are harbingers of even blacker ones to come, Might the black before the dawn... lead to some still as yet indiscernible sunrise of understanding among men. Violent words, no matter what their origin or motivation... Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Tonight, there will be few Americans who will go to bed without carrying with them the sense that somehow they have failed. If in the search of our conscience we find a new dedication to the American concept that brook no political, sectional, religious or racial divisions. Ana' it may yet be possible to say that John Fitzgerald Kennedy did not die in vain. That's the way it is, Monday, November 25th, 1963. This is Walter Cronkite. Good night."
46,2007,Captivity,American,"A young man is being tortured. Two tubes are inserted into his nose, and truck battery acid is pumped in through one pipe, causing blood to pour out through the other. The man's captor then kills him with a large hammer.
Jennifer Tree (Elisha Cuthbert), a young fashion model and cover girl, had captured the attention of photographers and, for better or worse, the public at large. On an evening out alone, Jennifer is stalked and drugged. She wakes in a stupor to find herself captive and confined to a cell. A series of metal bins and numbered lockers abruptly swing open in front of her. They contain personal items taken from her apartment. She is forced to view videotapes containing images of the victims who were tortured previous to her captivity, as well as videotaped interviews she had given to the media in the past. Realizing there is no way out, Jennifer pleads and screams to anyone who might hear her.
During her confinement, she is subjected to various forms of psychological torture. Jennifer eventually finds she is not alone. A young man, Gary (Daniel Gillies), is being held captive in an adjoining cell. The two make contact and try to find out why they are being held. They both make it to a garage, where they find a car. As soon as they are about to start it, gas erupts in the car, knocking them both unconscious. They find themselves back in their cells, where Jennifer sees a tape of Gary being taken and tied to a chair with a gun held under his chin. After a while of Jennifer worrying, she sees Gary being thrown into his cell. She rushes to him and helps him. They then proceed to have sex.
After Gary awakens, he discovers Jennifer had drunk a bottle of water that had a drug in it, to put her to sleep. He then gets up to wipe the blood off his nose. While he's leaving, he makes sure that Jennifer is sound asleep before leaving the cell. Gary's key opens a door into a house, revealing that Gary and his older brother Ben are actually Jennifer's captors. Gary joins Ben in the kitchen, where they make sushi. Gary tells Ben that he is falling in love with Jennifer. Ben then puts something in the fridge. When he turns around, Gary stabs him. Gary then watches the same tape of the woman lying on the bed that was shown earlier. The boy stabbing his mother is revealed to have been Gary looking at a smirking Ben. After the tape, Gary is seen reviewing a series of pictures in an album, and then there is a knock at the door. At the sound, he rushes to hide the albums in a cabinet.
Gary slams the cabinet door, but it does not fully close. Gary answers the door to find two detectives looking for Ben. Gary tells them that his brother is not at home. The detectives enter the house, get comfortable, and ask to watch a big sports game on television. One of them flips the channel to the surveillance video of Jennifer sleeping. Seeing this, Gary shoots them both. He runs down to where Jennifer is being held and tells her that he has killed the perpetrators and it's time for them to go. He places Jennifer in a room and tells her to stay there. One of the detectives, having survived the gunshot wound, jumps out at her. Believing him to be one of her captors, she kills him with a bat. Jennifer then discovers the partially open cabinet and begins viewing the albums. Gary is in all of them. While she looks through the albums, Ben, also not yet dead, jumps out at her. However, Jennifer finishes him off by stabbing the knife more deeply into him.
After viewing the albums, Jennifer hears the detective's pager ring, and she goes through his personal belongings. Gary records Jennifer, who claims she belongs to him and will help him clean up the mess. She tricks him and sprays ammonia in his eyes before running off. On her way, she cuts a series of wires and electrical cords, which prevents the doors, code entries, and lights from working. Jennifer picks up a flashlight and the gun used on the detectives. She points the flashlight at the opposite wall through a poster of her, distracting Gary. Jennifer goes through the door and points the gun at Gary. Gary then tries to persuade her to put the gun down. When it's clear that she won't, he lunges toward her with a pocket knife, and she shoots him. Gary falls back and tries to lunge again, but she shoots him a second time and he falls back on the bed. Gary whispers to her while gasping for air. Jennifer shoots at her poster, which covered a window leading outside. She drops the gun and walks outside and then down the street, finally free.
The film's original ending, shown in its entirety on the DVD, depicted a man being captured and tortured with acid before being murdered with a hammer. Through press clippings, the man is shown to be a serial killer of women, and his assailant is revealed to be Jennifer. This ending was re-edited and used as a cold open in the final cut.",4.6,tt0374563,"Oh boy, my fears... Well, let's see. I never really was comfortable with being alone. Then all those other girls, they were so jealous of the fact that they had to worry about what they wore at school. As if their parents cared. When you're in the public eye, beauty rules. You ladies know that. Oh, no, no, no. There is definitely no ""mister right."" And I sort of... wanted that attention. But you know, from my Dad... Not my real dad, he died, but my stepfather. But I wasn't quite sure how to get it but... I was passive, you know, and I think that's my worst nightmare. Being passive, so yeah... I was a rebel in high school. Always had like a little bra-strap showing. The black lipstick. God... I liked the attention walking down the sidewalk, all those eyes on me. But if a guy tried to talk to me, I was like whoa... so out of there. I can't help it if people are hooked on beauty. Ever since my dad died, my real dad. I either sleep with the TV on, or the lights on. Sometimes I tell myself stories. That kind of stuff. I hate the dark. Where am I? Please! Please! My apartment? No. How did you get in my apartment? Let me outta here, you fuck! You bastard! You don't know who I am! You won't get away with this! There'll be police all over this! You just entered a shit storm! This guy went all over the fuckin' place. And there's no prints either. Not even a fuckin' eyebrow here. So I spoke to Miss Tree's father. Didn't sound surprised at all. She said she left home when she was 15. Mother lives in Paris. - You got everything you need now? - Yeah, I guess. All right, John, bring it up. Okay, we're done here. Bettiger, come here for a second. What are you doing? It's Greek. It says... - How do you know it's Greek? - Because I read Greek. You read Greek? Yeah, I read Greek. Okay. What does it mean? It means, ""reflect... this dust that once knew fear."" So what, you've got me. So what? There is definitely no ""mister right"". My parents weren't in line when the love gene was being passed out. Yeah? I understand. Yup. You got it, Chief. Yes. Okay. Okay, that's it. That's... you hang in there, sweetie. Bye. Sweetie, huh? Mayor's bustin' his chops. I want you to meet my new partner. Ray ""The Greek"" Disantos. Evidence of bone and tissue. Yup, got it. Ten-four. So the missing girl is a movie star? Model, hot... Latest thing. So that was Wade in Forensics. The ash in the salt cellar, the DNA matched last year's victim. Mary Deavro. Oh, Mary. This kid was a national cheerleader champ. Me and you will inform the parents personally. 'Cause I knew her. Let them down easy. All right. So what do you guys make of the victims? A pattern? - Random. - I don't buy it. This guy doesn't do anything without purpose. Without precision. Sex, torture, killing... that's all the bonus. It's the control. That's what winds his clock. Captured. Me too. Two days. Why? Please! Please! Please help me! Help. Matches. There's only a few of these, so we shouldn't waste them, okay? We got to get out of here. But this whole place is sealed like some kind of wine cellar. I tried going through the vents, I got part of the way, it was too narrow. I got stuck. Have you seen him? No, he's been drugging me, I have absolutely no fuckin' sense of time. God, I know this might sound incredibly selfish, but right now I'm thanking God I'm not alone. You okay? Hear that? Oh, fuck you, motherfucker! You think he's been listening to us? Gotta figure, yeah. Assuming he is even a he. Oh, trust me, he's a he. Women don't do this kind of shit. You know that for a fact? Yeah, I've been stalked. And I know creeps, it comes with the job. What exactly is your job? Celebrity. Are you telling me it's like a big deal that you're gone? Maybe, maybe not. I've flaked out a couple of times. He knows all about me. He's been in my apartment. He's got books and stuff from mine. Yeah, he's got my clothes. Everything else is easy. Easy? Every interviewer's asked me anything you can imagine. What are you afraid of...? If you have to choose between pink and orange...? What's your idea of Hell? You always give them the answers? It's flirtation, sometimes you tell them the truth, sometimes you don't. But even your idea of Hell? I didn't tell them that. Let me guess. Isolation. Damn it! It's okay, look at me. How did he get you? I got suckered into going to this charity event at a club in Soho. Someone must've put something in my drink. That fucker... I needed some fresh air, there was a hand on my shoulder, leading me outside. And then a damp cloth... The last thing I remember was thinking that I hope he's not smearing my eye makeup all over. And you? I was driving from Nebraska to Connecticut. I got tired, so I pulled into a truck stop. I woke up, 'cause I thought I heard the sound of someone crying. I got out to see what the hell was going on. And then, wham... You see that? Last thing I remember... was the smell of french fries from the all-night diner at the stop. You... Here you go. Coffee's lukewarm. What were you doing, consulting a psychic? I was gettin' my Mac on brother... Mac on... - Doin' my thing. - What the fuck is this? Did you fuck with my phone? You need to take better care of your toys, man. Yeah, Chief. Hey, did you get shit about that model? What's her name? Miss Tree. Check on everybody from the club, guests and staff... Yeah, I appreciate that, but there were people in that club. And? I've got teams on it. We're making progress. Don't forget the caterers. Get back to me. You got it. - I know what the footprints mean. - Yeah, why don't you enlighten me? Think of a story. You're on a beach. In Hawaii. Oh yeah, the water's blue. If you're in here... what do you want? I knew you were going to do this to me too. You know I've never been... comfortable with the dark. I don't like being in the dark. It's always been a phobia. When you go on Safari, just nature is so awesome, don't you think? It was sort of scary too at the same time, even though I loved it. All that space just freaked me out. Here. Is this what you want? Gary. Are you okay? Yeah... He cut my hair. Why would he do that? He's cleaning things up, he comes in when he wants to and checks us. Was he taking blood samples? Hey, you listening to me, wherever you are! What's the point of antagonizing him? You got a better idea? Let's give this guy a show! Whatever he wants! Whatever the fuck that is! Why take blood samples and cut my hair off? I don't know, for a DNA maybe. DNA, what does he want to do, clone us? He's a mad scientist, how would I know? Forget it, this isn't going anywhere. So what do you do? When you're not trapped in a wine cellar. I sleep in other people's cars. When people want... to drive their cars from one coast to the other, but they don't have the time to drive, they use me. I have the time. I drive. It's a job. It is? Excuse me, if celebrity is a job, so is driving another person's car. I get why I was kidnapped. You have a value, and I don't? I'm not saying that it's not messed up, but the reality is... Reality is without guys like me to drive your cars, you'd be walking. And if there wasn't guys like me, there wouldn't be anyone to pay guys like you, would there? You live in this little bubble and you look down on the people who live in the real world. You're so full of it. What's it like, living in a bubble? Safe. And I'm not... full of it. And I'm not... full of it. And I'm not... full of it. We figure this guy is using sophisticated video equipment, recorders, shit like that. Run a check on all the local chains and look for large purchases by repeat customers. All right, listen, I buy it. He's making a video, but what for? Will you get this thing outta my face? Come on. He's using the video as a weapon against her. What do we know so far? He kills in April. He leaves the ashes of his last victim next to his current victim. Along with a quote on a tarot card. Locked in ritual. Poetry on tarot cards. In English, in Greek. He's not giving you guys any clues. He's fuckin' with you. This type of killer subconsciously wants to get caught. That's the real reason they go to the press, leave clues. Our guy hasn't given us anything concrete. He's not ready. Jesus Christ... Unless you get lucky or he screws up, I'm afraid she's on her own. Sorry. He lights a candle. We have a bottle of wine. He's with me... Holding me... Warm clothes, I'm not warm, but I feel warm inside. I feel him. He brings the candle towards me. The light... it gets brighter. Brighter... Help! Help me! Help! Don't you touch her! You sick fuck! Help! Help! Please! No! Help! No! Help! Help! You're okay. It's okay. Jennifer... Take a breath. Count to 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. Good, and count to 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. Motherfucker. Keep breathing, okay. I know. Count to four. Keep breathing. Keep counting, Jennifer. 1, 2, 3, 4. Where are we? Crawl space... The ground floor of this house is just above our heads, I think. Come on. Why do bad things happen to good people, you ask? That's the mystery, Mary! That's the mystery. Come on. Battery's dead! Pop the hood! Fire it up! Thank you. Gary! Gary! Gary! No! No! Damn it! No! No! No! What is this about, exactly? I'd appreciate it if you'd wear these gloves while you're in here. It's a homicide investigation, Mr. Dexter. We got a lot of questions we need answered. You understand? Yeah, I grasp the basic concept of the interview. But you have to understand, my records are confidential. I'm very careful about that. Leon! Would you like to get them into the truck before next Thursday? Mr. Dexter. I want you to know that I appreciate your position, so let me tell you how it's going to be. You're going to call your lawyer and I'm going to throw handcuffs on you. We're going to go downtown, and have a little get together down there. Let me cuff this guy. Barnett Freel has a criminal record, according to his W2's, state taxes, he works for you. When was the last time you've seen him? Barnett Freel... Last in on... Tuesday. Tuesday, you catered Club Shine on Tuesday. He work that event? Yes, he would have left after a.m. Big event. Correct me if I'm wrong but you pay this guy Freel 1,200 a month. So how is it that he spends over 3,600 a month on sophisticated electronics equipment? We live in an age of plastic? What can I tell ya? You got a current address on him? Oh, it's Brooklyn Heights someplace, let me check. Thank you. We're not getting out of here, are we? There's always a way out. We just have to think like him. Anticipate... The way he anticipated us? The wall's bullshit. He's made it impossible to get out of here, but we can get through the vents, I find the nail file, the car... He's playing with us. Showing his power. We're still alive, and as long as we're still alive we got to have hope. - What for? - You're not alone. Please, who isn't alone? I was alone when I was a kid, I ran away from home 'cause I was alone. And that's the way it works. Leave him alone! I can't do this. Imagine him with you. Who? Your lover. I don't have one. The one in your head. He's with you. He makes you feel safe. How? He lights a candle. He wants you to be close to him. You feel his touch. Yes. You feel his touch. Now what does he do? He comes closer. You bring him closer. And your eyes are shut but you can see the light. It's part of you. In your fingers, strengthens you. And the light is for real. Yes. All that you can see is flame. You're not alone. You are in the light. And you have no fear. You're not alone. Fucker! Fucker! Fuck! When the doors open, we didn't move. I wanted to. Yes. I was afraid that you weren't real. What's real? What you can touch. Key number 4. This is it. Don't. Gary! Come here! What's real? Tell me again. What you can touch. Sick motherfucking freak! You don't think I know! - Gary! - Come on. Don't! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! No! Don't kill him! What do you want to hear! Tell me what you want to hear! Don't kill him! Are you going to kill me? Gary! Gary! - Gary? - Jennifer... Oh, thank God. You begged for my life. I felt like I was paying for mine. I can't stop staring at you. I guess you get that a lot though, huh? Can't stop touching you. Me neither. Shit. Do you believe this shit? Yeah, hey, Susan. We're at Carson. And unless this guy lives in a crate, we're at a bullshit address. Shit? Hey, look at this. Hey, we got a great fuckin' view! It's a great view! So this is what we're going to do... Jennifer. Jen... I'm tired. Up on your feet. I feel like I did shots of Stoli. Jennifer, talk to me. I can't, just let me sleep. Jenny, come on. Jennifer. Can you hear me? That fucker. Oh, God... Jennifer. Was it good? One of the best. I thought you were going to wait till morning. Have another night of hero sex. - Don't you ever want to be the one? - The one...? Experiencing it? I do. Always. You're inside her, I'm inside her. Doesn't it ever get predictable for you? That's the point, predicting it. I said it would be the fourth day. It's the fourth day. She worships you. What if I don't want to end this one? You know the drill. Last one didn't even last days. It's not like we've gotten anything written in stone. Hey, look at me. No, no, look at me. We do this now, while she's still a smile on your little face. Ben, I don't know about this girl. I feel like this could be the one... You stop playing the game before it starts playing you. What do I always tell you? - Play them... - Not with them. It wouldn't last, things are what they are. It's the tapes and the books that make it better. Make it last forever. - Right? - Yes, sir. You got a good system, you stick with it. She wants me to be with her. What about me? You could do this without me. Well, that wouldn't be quite the same now, would it? We have a pattern. You can't change that, even if we wanted to. Death, that's where the buzz is. The redemption. The rest is preliminaries. So get the plastic bags. - Help me clean up. - No. I want to do it myself this time. That I would like to see. You don't believe I could do it? This girl's special, Ben. I feel like it's only right that I should do it. So you want to prove yourself, little brother? Okay. Okay. Just as well we do it right now. Ready? Yeah, I'm ready. Hello? Yes? NYPD. Mr. Dexter? Which Mr. Dexter do you want? Benjamin Dexter. Is he home? Ah, no. I can tell him you stopped by. You are...? I'm his brother. Oh, like the truck says. Dexter Brothers, right? Yeah. So you gonna open the door, Mr. Dexter? Knock off the hinges... You two always lived together? No. This was our parents' house. My brother lives here. That's a pretty bad cut you got there, man. All right? Oh God, yeah, football... Go ahead, you were saying? I'm staying here a few days, while my apartment is being refurnished. Where would that be? Queens. Hey, your sink doesn't work in there. Yeah, I know, my brother doesn't use this floor too much. So you guys want to tell me why you're here? We're investigating a missing person. It's a woman. Here's her picture. Pretty girl. How can I help? We just need to check on everyone that works for Dexter's Catering. Two minutes, man. Couple of questions and we're outta here in no time. Yeah, sure. Do you guys want a drink or something? Sure, you got any ice tea? Yeah, I think I do. - You? - Anything. Okay. Excuse me. Take your time. We thought we'd save you the trip. Sure. So then, you're not in the catering business with your brother then? Well I help him out once and awhile when he's in a pinch. Like Tuesday night? Club Shine? No, I wasn't there. You weren't there at all? Nope. Okay. Here's my card. - Thank you. - Okay. Oh, you know what, the playoff game is on channel 9. - It's the last quarter. - That's right. Do you mind if we check the score real quick? Channel 9? Yeah. That's great. Maybe your brother will be back by the time the game is over. Hey, look at this, we're winning. All right. This roaches shit... Get the fuck outta here. Look at this fuckin' shit. It's me, you got to wake up, Jennifer. Jennifer. You got to wake up, okay? Jennifer, there's not much time, okay, honey? You got to wake up, it's over. Over... It's over. What's over? This. There's no one to keep us here anymore. How? I killed them. Them? There was two of them. I killed them. Oh, my God! They underestimated me. One of them came in, I was ready for him. And I got his gun. Where are they? They're upstairs. Come on. They're really dead? You strong enough to walk? If you hold onto me... Listen to me. I'm not letting go of you. Not ever. Where are we? This is some old house. I haven't been outside. Don't worry. - Did you call the Police? - Not yet. - Where's the phone? - I don't know. Come on. There's the phone. Not yet. Sit down. I think these sadistic fuckers were taping us. And I want to find those tapes. If they get into the wrong hands... Okay? Gary! Gary! He was alive! You did what you had to do. He had a gun. He woulda... Jen, listen to me. You did nothing wrong. He had a gun. I should never have left you alone. Maybe you should come with me. Don't touch anything. No, the phones are dead, we need to call for help. Suppose they don't believe us... Believe what? That we had to kill them. There isn't any choice. I think there is. We just leave. Leave? Just walk out. Just tell no one. There's nothing to connect us to these fucking people. What about the fingerprints and the tapes? Well, I could wipe this place down in minutes. I'll take the tapes, could burn them too. Gary... You go home, and tell everybody the truth, that you fell in love with a guy and ran away with him for a week. If we live that, people will believe it. That simple. We walk away. Sit down. Now wait right here, okay? Don't even think about what you just did. Now in a few minutes more, we're going to be outta here. Beg. I need you to help me clean up. You belong to me. Yeah. Show me. You see? Yeah. Fuck! Fuck! It's not dark. It's not dark. You're a naughty girl. Don't be stupid. Where are you going to go? Come on, you couldn't even find yourself in broad daylight. Come on. There's no one coming for you. Give up. Jennifer! There's nowhere to go, Jennifer. Thank you. Thank you, Jen. Fuck! What's real, Gary? Huh? Put it down, Jennifer. Put it down. You see... You got out of your prison. That's more than you can say... about me. Not even in... that."
47,2012,ATM,American,"David Hargrove (Brian Geraghty) is a stockbroker having trouble asking out his co-worker Emily Brandt (Alice Eve), who is resigning for a position with the MPO. At a Christmas party, David offers to drop Emily home. Reluctantly, David also agrees to drive home his other co-worker Corey Thompson (Josh Peck), who accompanies them. During the car ride at midnight, Corey forces David to stop at a local ATM booth, needing to withdraw cash to buy pizza at a restaurant.
David spites Corey by parking some distance away, making him walk. However, David and Emily join Corey inside when he encounters card problems. When the three are about to leave, they spot a hooded figure (Mike O'Brian) in a parka coat lurking outside in the parking lot. They panic and Corey suggests they return to the car, but David and Emily suspect the figure to be a robber. They also discover he cannot enter without an ATM card.
When the hooded man kills a dog walker, they attempt to phone the police, only to realize that their cellphones were left in the car. The hooded man shuts down the booth's heater, rendering the booth cold to match the weather. David opts to negotiate their safety by giving the killer $500, earrings and a watch. He uses this to escape to his car, where he finds out that wires are severed, and the car cannot start. David attempts to call 911 but is attacked by the pursuing figure. He accidentally drops the phone in his attempt to escape from the hooded man.
Trying to attract assistance, Emily then uses her lipstick to write ""HELP"" on the booth's window, as the hooded figure tidies the scene outside. David, Emily and Corey are freezing when a security guard (Ernesto Griffith) locates them. When the guard tries to call the cops, the hooded man beats him to death using a tire iron from David's car trunk, leaving the three witnesses in shock. When a man with a similar coat abruptly enters the booth, he is subdued and killed by David and Corey, but is later revealed to be only an innocent janitor. Frustrated, Corey takes the janitor's coat and leaves, but gets caught and stabbed by the hooded man, and seemingly killed.
After several hours, David and Emily realize Corey is still alive. They retrieve him from outside, narrowly managing to return to the booth before the hooded man can get to them. The hooded man then blocks the booth door with David's car and tries to freeze them to death, by filling the booth with cold water. Corey eventually dies of blood loss and hypothermia. David lifts Emily on his shoulders to successfully trigger the fire sprinkler system alarm using the janitor's lighter, a trash can, and some paper; but David slipped, cause Emily falls and fatally snaps her neck.
Relentless, the hooded man sends the security guard's car into David's car, which slams into the booth and breaks it down. Angered, David improvises a Molotov cocktail and throws it at the hooded killer, but the figure he sets ablaze turns out to be the dead security guard in a parka coat. The police arrive but David is arrested as the hooded man hides himself. As David is driven away, he sees many unknown figures wearing parka coats in the crowd at the crime scene. The killer among the crowd spies on David and leaves the scene. The police recover surveillance recordings of the events within the ATM booth, but it is made clear the killer had planned his actions so as not to appear in the footage, framing David for the killer's crimes. The killer has also planted other evidence against David. In the final scene of the film, the hooded man, whose face is still unseen, returns to his headquarters, where he begins to map out similar attacks on a mini-mart, a farm house, and other ATMs.",4.7,tt1603257,"Sinopsis.

48,2010,Gulliver's Travels,American,"Deeply depressed at his dead-end job in the mail room of a New York City newspaper, Lemuel Gulliver decides to talk to journalist Darcy Silverman. He convinces her he could write a report about his (false) extensive world ""travels"" saying his dream is to become a writer. After suffering writer's block and thinking that Darcy will not want to hang out with a ""guy from the mailroom"", he plagiarises a report from other publications on the internet. The next day, Darcy, impressed by his writing, presents Gulliver with a new task – to travel to the Bermuda Triangle and write an article about the legends of ships mysteriously disappearing there.
Upon arrival in Bermuda, Gulliver rents a boat and travels into the triangle. After falling asleep at the helm of his ship, he's caught in a freak storm and the boat is overwhelmed by a waterspout. He washes up unconscious on the shore of Lilliput, where he is immediately confirmed as a ""beast"" by the town's tiny people. After the citizens claim him to be dangerous because of his huge size, he is captured and imprisoned in a cave. Here, he meets another prisoner named Horatio who was jailed by General Edward because he loves Princess Mary of Lilliput, whereas Edward also wants her. After the island across from Lilliput, Blefuscia, infiltrates commandos to kidnap Princess Mary, Gulliver manages to break free of the plough-machine he is forced to work and then rescues the princess from being kidnapped. Gulliver also saves her father, King Theodore from a fire by urinating on it.
Gulliver is declared a hero by Lilliput's citizens and makes up a deal of lies saying he is the President of Manhattan, says Yoda is his Vice-President and a living legend in his homeland. Edward, however, becomes enraged due to the luxurious accommodations that have been built for him, and even being presented as an honorary general of the Lilliputian Army complete with uniform. When the townspeople find Gulliver's boat and his things, Gulliver gets angry voicemails from Darcy, saying she has to take his place and travel to Bermuda now, and also found out about his plagiarism and now hates him. The next day, chaos ensues as the Blefuscian Navy lay siege on the city when Edward shuts down its defense system as an act of revenge for Gulliver's treatment. Gulliver defeats the armada, invulnerable to the cannonballs being fired at him (although he receives numerous welts on his stomach). Embarrassed once more, and with Mary no longer wanting to do anything with him, Edward defects to the Blefuscians and brings with him blueprints of a robot coming from Gulliver's Guitar Hero III game manual. The Blefuscians secretly build the robot, with Edward as the pilot.
The Blefuscians invade Liliput and the robot-wielding Edward makes Gulliver admit to the people that he is ""just the guy from the mail-room"" and nothing more. Edward banishes Gulliver on the shores of ""the island where we dare not go"" (Brobdingnag). There, he is snatched up by a ""little"" girl (Glumdalclitch) who towers over him. She captures him easily by trapping him inside a glass cup. When Gulliver wakes up, he finds himself dressed up in a pink dress and is played with by the ""little"" girl, which ends with him being tucked in bed. Horatio, who has gone to find Gulliver after being spurned by Mary, reveals to Gulliver that Darcy has been imprisoned by the Blefuscians when she is lost in the Bermuda Triangle in the same manner as Gulliver. Gulliver narrowly escapes with him, using a parachute that he took from a dead U.S. Air Force pilot sitting in the dollhouse.
Once again accepting a duel from Edward, this time not only for Lilliput's freedom but for its fate as well – as Edward threatens to destroy it should Gulliver fail – Gulliver ultimately defeats him with the assistance of Horatio, who disables the machine's electrocuting weapon. Horatio is hailed a hero and gets King Theodore's permission to court the princess. Edward, reaching the point of insanity, threatens to kill the princess, but the princess, finally having enough of Edward, beats the traitor up in frustration. Gulliver then helps to make peace between the rival island-nations by reciting Edwin Starr's ""War"" and he, along with Darcy, return to New York City on their repaired boat. The film ends with Gulliver, now a travel writer, taking Darcy to lunch while holding hands, after returning from another travel assignment.",4.9,tt1320261,"Gulliver's Travels Subtitles: Maver.ikk ""Give me your Press badge!""

Dan Quinn, born in 1990. Didn't think that was possible. Yes, 1990. People are born every year. What do you hope to get out from being in the Mailroom, Dan? I guess I hope to get out of 'being' in the Mailroom. You got 'Saz'. I like it. Guess what? You're hired. I'm Lemuel Gulliver. Welcome to the team! I was hired yesterday by the HR. What? - ""Doggie wants a bone"". Floor 30. This is the Editor's floor. - We're at the epicenter, my friend. Feel it! Feel it! - Ok. Oh, we've got a little something for you. Oh, damn it! Sorry about that! Listen, I will try clean that. Sorry! Sorry about that. 'Bye. Just wait a minute. - Huh? One second. It's your mail, sir. Hey, you're Herald Jones, right? - Yes. I love your piece on ""the failures and dreams of the markets"". Thanks very much. Look forward to seeing you around. And you've been an inspiration to all the readers. Dan, what are you doing? You CAN'T talk to those guys! Why not? - Because, okay... ...this is your first day. We're the Mailroom guys. Mailroom guys are meant to be seen and not heard. And ideally, not even seen! We are not at their level. We are little people. You know what it is? I think you're just scared talk to them. I'm not! Listen, I'm just respectful of their workspace. I talk with these people all the time... Thanks, I'll let you know once I made a decision, Nigel. Thanks you. - Thank you. Good day, fellas! - Good day mate! Gulliver! Got any mail for me? Yeah .. No. Maybe. Let me check. Hi, I'm Dan... from the Mailroom. - Darcy. I will do whatever it takes to ""not"" be from the Mailroom. Doesn't really need to bother her right now, she's busy. You're not really bothering me. I love every reason to procrastinate. Yes, me too. You're not bugging me. Right, oh, wow... I'll see you guys later. - Ok, good to see you! Let's go! So, how long did you have that debilitating crush on the 'travel letter'? Crush on Darcy? No way, dude. Ok, first of all, you're a terrible liar. Second of all, Why didn't you just ask her out? Oh, you don't think that I'm gonna ask her out? - No. Dude, I'm gonna ask her out ""whenever"" or ""wherever""... ...no problem, It just take me seconds. ""Will you go out with me?"" ""Yes""... done! I'm not going out with Darcy Silverman. We're ""boyfriend, girlfriend"" ""You know Gulliver and Darcy?"" ""Yes, they're the cutest couple ever!"" - Ok, so... ...really do it! The next time I see her, I will! Hold on! ""Hi, again. ""Oh, hi, Darcy! I just remembered... I get claustrophobia in elevators. How is your day going? - Really good. It's going really good. What are you doing this weekend? - So much... that I've just got to do a... ...bunch of stuff. -Cool. - Yeah, it's cool! Have a good one! - You too! Wait! I forgot something. - Yeah, me too. Gul. Yeah? - Yeaaah! You chickened out, didn't you? Listen... I just... you know.... I didn't chicken out. You're being respectful of her workspace. - Exactly. Dude, speaking of which, after work, do you want to go for a couple of brews... ...shoot some pools, maybe a little man date, huh? I don't think so. Especially if it's called a 'man date', sir... I got you! You want a 'rain cheque'. You want to wake up all 'bright-eyed' and 'bushy-tailed' for the boss. You are not my boss anymore. - What're you talkin' about? I just got promoted. It's impossible! You just got here. Yeah, they promoted me to the 'head' of the Mailroom. So, I'm your boss now. Look, Gulliver, the reason you didn't ask her out... ...and you never will, is the same reason you're not going to leave the Mailroom. You've been here like ten years, man. You know, you ... You peaked. When you talk the big game, and that could be fun ...sometimes. And you're pretty funny around the office... ...but that's all you are. Just 'talk'. So, you might as well face it. You're never really going to get any bigger than this. These talks is... the worst part of being a boss. Anyway, be in tomorrow at 7am. We're gonna sort of change things up and... ...let's start with playing the guitar during working hours. Good night, Darcy! See ya! Gulliver? Hi. Hi. Can I help you? - Yeah, I. .. Well, I wanted to see if ... you wanted to... You seem a little nervous. Are you alright? I'm fine. I'm just... I've got so much going on... I wanted to pick this up, and then I was on my way. You want to apply for a 'travel writing summit'? Yup, exactly. I had no idea you wrote, or travel. I do, I travel a lot. I go to New Zealand... ...been to Mexico, ""me-hee-kaw"" as they called it, the locals. Africa, the Congo... ...which I know is in Africa because I 'travel' and 'write'. So, this is kind of like what I want to do. Why don't you bring in a writing sample tomorrow morning and I'll see what I can do. Perfect. Okay. Hey, Gulliver! Nice job putting yourself up for it. Yeah, cool. Okay, bye-bye. - Bye-bye! Gulliver's Travels Jesus! I meant to ask her out... Now she's expecting a writing sample? What was I thinking?! I saw some things in different lands i I got to write this thing! No, I've got nothing. Oaxaca, MEXICO Wow! I'm so impressed, Gulliver. I had no idea that you're such a good writer. Well, I tried to keep it a secret... I don't like to brag about my more literarian side. These samples are terrific, and you exhibit such variety. I mean, this one about Oaxaca feels really classic. Like it's straight out of 'Frommer's'... ...where a description of Barcelona is all sassy! It's like I'm reading 'Time Out'! I think I've the perfect fluff piece to start you off with! There's a guy down in Bermuda who claims he has the secret to the Bermuda Triangle. He's either crazy or he's trying to build... But I figure it could be a fun way in... ...to explore Bermuda and the small islands around it, you know. You have boat experience, don't you? I'm... I'm a... I'm a 'boat' man. Okay, good, 'cos... I've to be honest with you... It's hard for me to find someone to do this. You have to be at sea for weeks, completely off the grid. That's okay with you, right? Good, 'cos I thought I was going to have to do it and... ...I do get 'super' sea sick. Crazy! - Yeah. What do you say? Not a big story... ...but it's a start. Okay, so the Bermuda Triangle, huh? And everything I need to know is in here? - It is. Your contact has been arranged. And there's a boat waiting for you. Yeah! Oh, hey! That's me! Precious cargo! No! No! Hoo... Ok! i That was close. All the chickens get off the road, man! I don't know about this, Hank. I mean, are you sure this is safe? All this Bermuda Triangle talk... ...is just to sell T-shirts to tourists. It's a good story to pick up some girls. This is your boat. ""KnotferSail"" They really went 'Pun-tastic' on that boat. Well, the Dock Master's really into pun, man. He believes it keeps the pirates away. ""Ship Happens."" This is 'you'. And that's your 'destination'. Just follow that 'dot' and you'll find yourself in the 'Triangle'. In the Bermuda Triangle? - Yeah! And then to come home, you said, I turn this knob and follow the 'dot' back home? Yes! - Easy! Done! - Done! All right. - I got it. Fine, fine! Well .. It's not moving. Okay. Where is the clutch? And as you go out, to the ocean water... i ...towards the Bermuda Triangle, there're reflections everywhere. i I should have brought sunglasses. I'm as hungry as a horse. I could eat a thousand cheeseburgers. Okay, 'quitting' time. Yeah! How to build your own robot. That's going to happen! Darcy. Cheeseburger. Darcy. Cheeseburger. i Safety! Okay. Rubber ducky. No! Floaties! For the legs, for the arms... ...for the head! I am safe! 911! Gotcha! Oh, no! I'm paralyzed from the neck down. What is that crawling on me? No, no, not fire ants! Please don't be... fire ants. I am General Edward Edwardian, Commander of Lilliput. All hail, Liliput! All hail Liliput! I ""You are herewith charged with aiding our sworn enemy, the Blefuscu!"" ""You are our prisoner and shall be presented to our Royal Highness... ...King Theodore! What say you, Beast?! You are not real! Where am I? Where am I? I'm dreaming. I'm going to close my eyes... ...and then I'm going to open them and I'll be home in bed. Okay! Okay! My spear. Bring the Beast down! Alright, boys! Release the hookers! Pull! Pull! Pull! - That's not cool! Hey! That's my pants. That's not funny! Unlucky! Pull! Pull! Lift! Rest! This Giant is hereby declared to be brought to His Majesty, King Theodore! All hail King Theodore! All hail King Theodore! i I wanted a bracelet... ...not a great, big hairy Beast! Oh, dear... are these strings really necessary? They are... My innocent, naive, little 'Bunny tail'. To prevent the giant Beast from running rampant and killing us all! What is this thing? - A Blefuscian spy. I am not a 'Blefuscian'. I don't even know what that is. Someone please, just tell me where I am? You're in Lilliput! - Liliput? The grandest and greatest land in all the world! All hail Lilliput! All hail Lilliput! i This is insane! This is insane! Okay, enough! Come out with the funny cameras! Mealtime, Beast! i Hay? I can't eat hay! Eat up! You've a busy day ahead of you, Beast! Enough with the 'Beast' thing! I may be a giant but I have feelings! I think that you will find that the hay is... ...a bit more digestible if mixed with some sewer water. I am sorry my countrymen called you a 'Beast'. I do not think of you as a 'Beast'. As a matter of fact... ...before you arrived, I was the tallest man in the Lilliput. So, I know how you feel. - Thanks, man. I can't reach you for a handshake. I am Gulliver. Horatio. You guys are so tiny. Are you the only prisoner in the whole dungeon? Yes, I've been placed in this prison by the great and glorious general Edward Edwardian... ...for sending an illicit letter to his betrothed... ...Princess Mary. That's it? He put you in prison for hitting on his lady? Dude, that is harsh! No, no, no, you must understand that I am of a lowly station. To legally court a woman of her stature... ...one must commit a valued action... ...which is virtually impossible as a commoner. Come on, don't be so hard on yourself. You seem like a cool guy. You can do something valiant! Gen. Edward has led countless crusades... and is known far and wide for his bravery. I'm no Gen. Edward. Well .. No offense, but this Edward guy, seems like kind of a lame-ass. A lame what? It's my impression that 'lame-ass'... ...is a negative expression from whence you came. If this is the case, you should be thrown into stocks! No, no! ""Lame-ass"" means, 'great, brave... ...courageous, heart of a lion' man. Is this the honorable truth? Yes, this is the honorable truth. Then, I'm not just a 'lame-ass'. No. I'm a big 'lame-ass'! - The biggest! I, General Edward Edwardian, I'm the biggest 'lame-ass' in all of the land! Heart of the lion! So, listen... now you know that we're cool... What do say if you loosen up these shackles a bit? No. It's time for your life of hard labor to begin. Left i Right i Left i Right i Left i Their Defense System is operational. We must move in stealthily. Left i Did I tell you to stop fanning, peasant?! - Sorry. They would be too busy with the fire to protect their Princess. Fire! Fire is bells. There was 3. It is an attack! There were more than bells and a pause, then a third bell. So, there is an attack and a fire? The Blefuscians! - The Princess! To the Castle, Beast! Left, right! Faster, Beast! Oh, no! The Blefuscians! Do not kidnap me! Please do not kidnap me! Why is she standing there? First, she's going to get kidnapped and... - You speak not of the Princess! Down! I shall save you, my Princess! 'My Princess'. Dude, I can help! We do not need your help, Beast. You just stay here! Nobody save the Princess! He'll never get to her in time! Please, you must save the Princess! Yeah, but you heard that angry little dingleberry, he said I shouldn't! I beg of you! It's too late. - You're kidnapped! I am kidnapped! - Not on my watch! Hop on, Princess. Let's get you out of here. Fear not, darling! I am here to save you! Where did she go? Oh... She has been kidnapped. Here you go, Princess. - Thank you so much! Are you okay? - Yes. Thank God. The Blefuscians have retreated. - We ought to have a victory feast! Terrific! The fire has raised out of control. - My father is trapped! You guys got to invest in a more efficient warning system! Your Highness! Out of the way! I've gotta put out the fire! Out of the way... Coming through! The Beast! Yeoow! I've gotta say that was hot! Princess, no! Princess... no... you mustn't! - Father! He's burning! You have served me with great honor! We need access to a great deal of water! - Do something! I do not want to do this. You have a plan?! - I have a plan but you're not going to like it. Don't look. Seize Beast! It's working! Yes it is working! Out of the way! How dare you evacuate yourself on our great and glorious... Oh no... Oh no. Sorry about that smell. I have been drinking sewer water. - This is ground for execution! I know that was pretty gross. Let me pull up my trousers. Father! Father! You look glorious! Thank you my dear. Our Savior, the Beast! Beast! Beast! Beast! Beast! Beast! Beast! Hey, guys... It was nothing, really. I saw a fire, I had some water and released flood on 'I-O-2' Instant-On Input-Output. Is that translated? You got the joke here? 'Flood on I-O-2'? Ok, Thanks to you guys. The King requests the honor of your company at the banquet this evening... Do you accept? - Yeah, on one condition. You free my friend Horatio, and allow me to bring him as my 'Plus One'. He was jailed for 'unlawful' courting. He must return... That's my condish! One moment, if you will. Why are you doing this for me? Because you are my buddy. I'm not going to this thing without you. I'm not going to know anybody there. You have to come! Shhh... Play it cool. The King requests the honor of your... ...and Horatio's company at the Royal banquet this evening. Do you accept? - Yes indeed. I can make it. - Oh, God... My God! I'm forever indebted to you. It's not necessary. Instead, let's just do this. What is that? - You pound it... with your fist. Come on, don't let me hangin'. Yeah! Now, let's go P-A-R-T-Y... Yeaaaah! Will not somebody ... I'll eat everything. So, since you are not from Blefuscia, where are you from? Beast? Once again, totally cool to be just called Gulliver. Some people believe that you've come from the island that we dare not go. Is there any truth to this rumor? No. Where is ""The island that we dare not go""? There, beyond the fog bank. Nuh, I didn't come from the fog bank. I'm from the island of Manhattan. Between the islands of Staten and Long. This island of Manhattan? What sort of 'Kingdom' is it? I'm not from a 'Kingdom'. I'm actually from a democracy. You see, we elect a president every years. You're so honorable and courageous. Were you the President? - Of course he was, Mother! Look at him. He's the most powerful gentleman in all the land. So sorry mother embarrassed you. No, no, it's a common mistake to not think I was President. Are you a victorious President? Oh, yeah, pretty victorious Noble as well? Yeah, I was eh... ...Super noble. I was actually known as 'President the Awesome'. 'President the Awesome'. Pretty unlikely title. When do you return home, noble and awesome Gulliver? Pretty soon, I suppose, yes? I should imagine they're falling apart without you. Their 'greatest' hero. Well, without my boat... looks like I'm stuck here. Don't worry, my army will find your boat. At the meantime, I'm sure we could find you a suitable accommodation. You mean... some hay to sleep on? Anything. - Anything? We have the finest builders in all the land. We can build you anything. Seriously, We are ridiculously good builders. And we are your servants, Awesome Gulliver. I don't want to take advantage, but... Day of my stay here in Lliliput. i At first, me and the little guys get off on the wrong foot i but it turns out that they are a pretty solid group of dudes. i They are building me a temporary place to live. i They threw me an awesome party just to release in myself. i And the King sent out a search party to find my boat. i At the meantime, I'm 'worthing' it. i Hmmm, That is a good cup of joe. Good morning. Good morning, Gulliver. Top of the morning to you, fellas. Gulliver Your media room is ready. Obi-Wan did I tell you what happened to your father? You told me enough. You told me you killed him! No, Gulliver! I am your father! No way. This is an impossibility! - Yet somehow it seems completely inevitable. Gulliver, you truly have lived a thousand lives. King Theodore, it's time to perform our bi-weekly military exercise! Just one moment. We're watching the stories of Gulliver's life. Sir, we've not missed a military exercise over years. Dude! - Get out of the way! We can not see the screen. The Titanic is sinking! But it was made to be unsinkable. ""I love you, Gulliver. - No, no, don't do that."" ""You're going to make lots of babies and die on a warm bed at a very old age."" ""God."" ""I'm the king of the world!"" Wait. I'm sorry. You mean to say that you actually died in the ship wreck? Yes. I died. - That's what you're telling us? You actually died? - Yeah, but I was resuscitated. It's preposterous! - But then, I survived! That's ridiculous! Well, you have to see the scene... - Well, okay now. It's silly! Silly, silly stories! Let me get this straight. After you were brought back to life as an avatar. That's when you met your Princess Darcy Silverman, Manhattan. Yeah, I can't wait to get back to her. I noticed you had a little eye-contact with the Princess. How's it going? - Good, yeah, I think if things go well... ...within to years she may then speak to me. Wow... wo... wo... Hold your horses. - Thank God. You can't woo a lady by hoping that 'then' she'll speak to you. To land a Princess, you got to employ some 'grey day cortash'. Could you teach me? This... this 'Cortage' that you speak. Yeah, I can teach you some of my moves. Yes! Thank you. - If you beat me back home! On your mark, get set, go! - I'm not ready to race you! Princess! Oh, Princess! Wherefore art thou, Princess? Hello, who calls? It's I, Horatio! Why are you so far away? I don't want to invoke the ire of thy father. But I must be honest. ""And tell ye ... - And tell ye ... Tell me what, Horatio? ""You don't have to be rich to be my girl."" ""Say it!"" You don't have to be rich to be my girl. ""You don't have to be cool to rule my world."" Horatio, these 'passion' words can get us into trouble. ""There is no particular sign that I'm more compatible with."" There is no particular sign... ...that I'm more compatible with. ""I just want your extra time and your.... ...kiss."" ...kiss. Oh, what beauty emanates from your lips! ""I think I'm gonna dance now."" I think I better dance now! D-dance now! Feel it. Put the mustard on, baby. Yes, feel, move the hips. I don't think it is working. You are not dancing good. Shake. I've never been wooed with such unique passion. It's working. Did I tell you? Yes! I hear someone coming. 'Til tomorrow. It worked! Let's go! To whom were you speaking, my Darling? No one. Me ... I... ...was speaking to me, myself. What are you doing In my chambers? I have come to court you. As I always do at this time of the day. Or have you already forgotten who is your one true, eternal love? No, of course, I remember. Remember what? That... that you are my one, true eternal love. It's just that I was talking with the Giant and lost track of time. I trust not this Beast. He seems trustworthy to me. He is very nice. You've done sewing? - Sewing, yes... ...embroidery. It's my Grandmother's doily. I captured a hawk today. - Did you? He laid on the field, I came behind him and catch him with my bare hand. This is impressive also. Oh... fun! Fun courtship, you and I have. It is over, now. Must go! Those villagers shan't pillage themselves. We must alert General Edwards of this at once! We found it. I hear you Ring-A-Ling-A-Ding-Dong. How is it going? - Hello, Beast. I come bearing the most terrific news! Yeah, really? - We have discovered your ship! The ""KnotferSail"". Clever name! You did it. You found my boat! I'm actually going home. Hey, you guys can fix this thing, right? Of course you can, you incredibly awesome builders! Yes! Darcy is about to read the best article ever. Talking 'Pulitzer', huh? Slide to unlock. What're you guys doing? It's that my phone? Yeah, it's A-lookin'. No signal but I have messages, Mr. Popularity. Hey, Gulliver it's me. It's Darcy. i You know I just realized why I felt your writing came straight out of Frommer's... i because it does! Call me as soon as you get this. I Sergeant, what is he doing? He's checking his 'voicemail', General Edward. Very good. What is 'voicemail'? Hey, Lemuel, it's Darcy. I've totally forgiven you. I Wait, no I haven't! 'Coz now I have get seasick on a boat... i ...to cover your butt. Thanks for this. I And If you can't tell, then thanks for sarcastic. i Darcy again. i I can't believe you lied to me. I trusted you. I Wherever you're hiding. Stay there. I never want to hear from you again! I Mr. Beast, I've instructed our builders to work day and night... ...to ensure that you are sea-worthy by week's end. Isn't that the most fantastic news you've ever received in your life? Great... I can't tell you how happy I am... ...for you. Why do you look so forlorn, noble protector? Me? Forlorn, no way. You do look quite forlorn. Just for the record, what does 'forlorn' means again? Is it like sad? Basically, just a bit more dramatic sounding. Oh, well, in that case, I guess I'm a little 'forlorn'. Oh, Gulliver, you miss your Princess. Well... The truth is we are not super close. Oh, Gulliver ... She's kind of mad at me right now. I am forlorn as well. I don't know what to do. I think I'm in love with Horatio. But that's great. Don't be forlorn about that. Most people spend their whole lives looking for that and they don't find it. Go for it! Follow your heart! - But my heart is promised to General Edward. And I can not break that vow. He will lose honor... ...and respect, and he'll die of heartbreak. Okay, look, he's just being melodramatic. Is he? - Yeah. Gulliver, I will miss you so much. - I'm going to miss you too. Maybe I should stay. Don't you miss your subjects? And the White House? And the Millennium Falcon? Yeah, but vice president can run things without me for a while. You think the king would mind If I stuck around for a bit? Of course not, Gulliver. You've made everyone here so happy. I can't imagine anyone in Lilliput not wanting you to stay... ...as long as possible. Noble and valiant King Theodore i I trusteth not this Beast Gulliver who liveth in our midst. He can now leaveth, but he chooses to stay. And furthermore, I do not believeth who he saith he isth. I mosteth humbly disagreeth. And whyeth must we always go on with these 'Fs'? Because we speak officiallyeth? Forget it, from now on, even when speaking officially... ...we must get rid of these 'Fs'. Official speaking is an illustrious Lilliputian tradition! Woh.... 'Inside-castle-voice' please. Forgive meeth. Forgive me. You know I think this job's beginning to stress you out. Maybe a little 'Time-off' will be the thing. Who else could run your army? Our new General, Gulliver! I I won't let you down, King. And I look forward to working with you, Vice-General Edward. Vice General? Vice. I've never been a ""Vice"" of anything. I can't be expected to take orders from that gigantic fool! I rather take orders from a woman. You are relieved. Thank you Vice-General Edward. Alright, Gulliver, protect against this! They have turned off their defence system. Alert the king! And prepare the Armada. Oh, no. Our defence system has failed. We shall never reach our ships on time. Careful now. Mind yourselves. I Oh what a mess. i They are defenseless. Ceasefire and ready the troops! Gulliver! The Blefuscians attacked. Are you sure? - Yes! Please! We need you. You are our General. Good Lord! It's the entire Blefuscian Armada! - I know. Finally! Our General has arrived. What's going on? I heard the bells. As our 'mighty' General, you must lead the army... ...to save Lilliput and vanquish the entire Blefuscian Armada. You want me to vanquish all of them? Yes, please. Everyone last one of them. Yeah, fine. - Thank you, fair Gulliver! Okay. Here we go. Time to vanquish. It's cold. No problem. You're going down. Why have we stop? - It's him! Hey, dudes. I am Gulliver. I come in peace. Listen, They want me to vanquish you guys. I don't want to vanquish anybody and you don't want to be vanquished. Let's just pretend, okay? I'll go crazy, you act all scared, and... Just follow my lead, alright? Sell it! Turn the ships! Sound the alarm! This truly is the battle of the ages! - It truly is! I'll just tell them you're too swift or whatever ... How come you all turned around? Fire! Oh no! That looks painful! I am invincible. Yes! Go on, Gulliver! Well done! Excellent! Well done, you big fat pig. Pound it. Well done, Gulliver! This is glorious! Goal! Alright! Yeah! Guys, this is what I'm talking about! Look at that! The Billboards and the lights. Home sweet home. What can I say? Okay, can you guys send over a division to my left shoulder, please? North clicks. One click. Oh, yeah! That's the spot! A little off the top. Don't go crazy. And don't shave off my sideburns. I need those monkey chaffs. Can I double the bet with you because I was playing and singing. You did good though. Let's try again from the top! One second, please. Pause game. - Pause game. I was just thinking. You are the General of Lilliput now. Shouldn't you be training the army? What if Blefuscian should attack again? Oh, man, no one's going to attack. Not while I'm around. I'm one-man wrecking crew. If you want to worry about something... You should worry about how you haven't made a move on the Princess yet. You're in danger of falling in the 'Friendship Lagoon'. What? Yeah, 'Friendship Lagoon'. It blows. You'll gonna be like: ""Oh yeah, We're friends, that's great, I'm cool with that."" And you won't be cool with that! And it kills you inside! No, never. Yeah, man! You got to 'man-up' and be direct. Next time you see her Just tell her: ""What's up?"". ""Hey, what's up sexy? I hope it's not too forward but I find you incredibly sexy."" ""I never told you before, but I'm really into you."" ""But I'm also into a lot of things. So don't get too excited."" ""There're a lot of things going on. I like you to be one of them."" See the way I mixed it up? I want you, but not that much. You try it! Okay, show which face? Dude, you know, if the face comes to you but make it look natural. Don't make it a forced face. I just have, you know, one of those faces that just happen naturally. My hands are sweating. - Go! Well, hello, fine maiden with the wide... ...child-bearing hips. Yikes, you don't want to talk about ""wide child-bearing hips."" It's a good instinct. You're getting there. But this time more smooth and sexy. No ""big hips""? --No ""big hips"". I've got it. Well, hello there, slim. I ought to call you Portamus because you've got no hip. Do we have to be here for this? Take five. Save game. Forget about the hips. Here's what you've got to do. What are you doing In my chambers? I have come to court you. As I always do at this time of the day. This is not the time of day for courting. You cannot just barge in. I can court you when I wish to court you. I'm not in the mood to be courted. I have a headache. It's your womanly duty. Section 4.2 of the Official Courting Doctrine. Edward! I'm unsure about things between us. It be not you. It be me but I'm very unsure. That maketh no sense. We ought to be married. You are to be my bride. We are not in love. We're not in love. Who do you love about me? Name one thing. Inappropriate, Edward. Reach for it. - One second! Okay. Take your time. I find you... absolutely... satisfactory. Edward, that's not enough to say that someone is average, or adequate or moderate. I want to be loved for who I am! There's an awful lot going on up here. Is there? - Now you're being cruel. And frankly, melodramatic. And acting like a complete baby! You are acting like a little Princess! - I am a Princess! Maybe I should act like a Princess. Gulliver was so right about you! - Why don't we all just listen to the Beast! Don't call him that! - He's a big ugly Beast And you should know better! - Get out! You can't break our engagement! It's a fate worse than death. Get out! You'll be sorry you ever crossed General Edward! Get your Gulliver T-shirt! i You sir! Get your Gulliver T-shirt! i What do you want? This Beast has transformed Lilliput... ...into his own sordid and rotten little kingdom! And he will do the same to your land if we do not stop him. To save Lilliput, I must first destroy it. How do you suggest we complete such a dangerous task? Alright! Welcome to the first ever Lilipaloosa! I Let's get this party started with a little gem I wrote! Right? So what are you up to tomorrow? - Tomorrow? Yes. - I'm just hanging, you know. Would you care to attend the Ball of the Moonlight with me? Oh, the Ball! The Ball's tomorrow! Right. Maybe. Why are you acting like this? Acting like what? - Why are you being so strange? I am a gentleman merchant about town, and I have got to keep my options open. Do you? That's what I've been told. - Well, I'm not an 'option'. I'm a lady. - I know you are. And I love ladies. I'm sorry... Five bells. What does five bells mean? - There've never been bells! Don't worry about it. 'Coz this guy throws down no matter how many bells they're ringin'. Don't freak, little peeps. This one's on me. You gotta be kidding me. This is bells? Ha... it's cute! Edward, you traitor! How dare you forsake your lilliputian brothers? I only forsoken for I was forsoken! 'Forsoking' ends now. I challenge you to a duel! Cool. Whatever. Do you accept? - Oh... Yeah! Yeah, I accept your duel. Good. - Make a move. Wow! You are hard. Okay, just stretching up. It is a good thing to do before the duel. You brought this on yourself, Beast. Do you surrender, Beast? Sure, yeah, whatever! No, no, no... Say it properly, Say it, you surrender! Say it! Say it! Say! I surrender! I surrender! You win. Release my butt. You can not surrender. You are our most glorious protector! You are 'President The Awesome'! You and Captain Sparrow defeated The Joker and Magneto. And you and Jack Bauer had only hours to do it. I didn't do any of that stuff. I'm just the guy from the mailroom. But you gave us your word! - I'm sorry. I lied. I knew it! I hereby banish this Beast to the island where we dare not go! Never to return to Lilliput again! Take your positions! Please Gulliver! Hey, is this 'Island that we dare not go' really as bad as they say? It's delightful! Okay, no little people anywhere. It's a good sign. Hello! Is anybody here?! No way! Raise the flag! Can I not walk alone in my own garden? Go away! Princess. I've secured a boat. We can leave tonight. No, Horatio. But Edward's going to force you to marry him. I don't have any choice. Please, please... Yes, of course you have a choice. You made that choice for me. - You don't understand. Gulliver told me... - Everything Gulliver said was a lie. Including you. Oh, I'm paralysed from the waist down. What's that crawling on me? Not fire ants. Oh please don't be fire ants. Am General Edward Edwardian. Commander of the new Blefuscia. All hail Blefuscia! All hail Blefuscia! - I must warn Gulliver! State your name, She-Beast. Darcy Silverman. - Of Manhattan? Ahhhhhh...! Noooo......! i I'm not doing this. You got me in the diapers and dress. I'm not doing tea-time with you. Go find another doll! Tea-time... time for tea! Okay, we're kissing. Ohhh.... Gentle-r! Just hold hands, will you? What's up? What kind of toy are you? Top Gun, G.I Joe? Cool detail. Gulliver! Gulliver! i Down here! What are you doing here? Gulliver, you must return to Lilliput at once! Forget it, man, it's a No-Go. - No! You don't understand! Edward ... Doesn't matter. I may be a hundred feet tall, but I'm not half the size of... ...one of you little guys. - You've got to listen to me, this is important! No. This is where I belong. As a giant girl's babydoll. Hey! Stop feeling sorry for yourself and listen! Blefucian has taken over Lilliput and Edward,... ...has captured Darcy Silverman of Manhattan. What? She's... Darcy's here? - Yeah! Oh no! She said she was going to do the assignment herself. She's here because of me. - It's all because of you. How could you lie to us? I was afraid to tell you guys the truth. Because it was just so great being a Big shot for the first time in my life. I didn't want it to end. Snap out of it, man. You think of yourself as this small little thing. But that's not how I see you. Think about what've done already. You saved the Princess,... You single-handedly defeated the entire Blefuscian Armada. Didn't you? Come on, I'm your best friend. I wouldn't lie to you. You can do this. So take off that dress and let's get out of here! Am I really your best friend? You're kind of my only friend. - It's great, man. You too for me. Let's go save Lilliput. - Yeah, let's go do this. Take me with you! One second. There we go. - I gotcha. Okay, officer... I'm just going to borrow this parachute, if it's okay with you. You don't need it anymore. This is insane! Oh, I'll let you. - Thanks, Horatio. - Good luck! I got this. Darcy! Darce! Gulliver! - Hey! I'm coming over there. Are you okay? I can't believe you're here. I mean, of all the places, right? What's up? - What's up? What's up? What isn't up? Can you talk about the inverted whirlpool. Crazy... And why does everybody calling me a ""Princess""? They don't. I think you misheard. I see you've returned for your ""Princess"". Now, you heard it right there. He just called me your ""Princess""? That's because everybody is a Princess here. I forgot to tell you, It's just this sort of a thing. If you wish to speak to your one true love more privately... ...we should cover our ears. ""One true love""? I told them I was your ""one true love""? Is it now a good or bad time to tell you about... ...the crush I've had on you for the last years? Really? Yeah. I totally have a crush on you. That's why you're always wheel in the mail cart around and none of the mail is for me? Yeah. Hmm... Yeah. I told everyboby that you're my 'girlfriend'. It's really embarrassing. I think it's kinda sweet. Gulliver, we've gotta focus. We've got a book to the podium. We're gonna get the hell out of here. We are surrounded by little people? - Darcy, listen to me. I would love to book with you, over to the boat right now. But I can't. These little people have grown very large in my heart. They depended on me and I let them down. I have to do this first. King... If it's alright with you, I would like to be your glorious protector again. I don't know. How are we to believe anything you say, Gulliver? Because my word is my bond... ...this time, for real. I promise. - Gulliver. You work in the mailroom - Not today... I don't! Hey, Edward! If I win, Lilliput returns to her former glory. And if you lose. This is what becomes of Lilliput! Oh, I've made a slight improvement. Shocking, isn't it?! Hey, hey that's not fair. He's cheating! I've got to do something! Now, do what you do best, Beast, and run off! No way. Not today. I've always liked you, Gulliver. I've always thought we had a real 'spark'. Hang on, Gulliver! I'm on my way! Gulliver, no! I'll sizzle ya bit by bit! It is hot! Go, Gulliver! - Yes, Gulliver, go! Take it! Now that's a Wedgie! Yeah, Gulliver! Did you see that?! I want you to get back to the second grade. I'm so, so sorry. I hope you can forgive me for the way I behaved. You are not an ""option"". You're the most beautiful lady of all the land. And you're also super cool. And a stone-cold fox. Horatio! Do you realize what you've done? You have committed a 'Knight of Valiance'. I hereby give you my permission. Yeah! Nobody move. Halt! Stop! I've kidnapped the Princess. You've been kidnapped, congratulations. Enough with the kidnappings! Boosh! Yes! Listen! I played your eyes all that stuff because I thought you'll never want to go out with the dude in the mailroom. I'm sorry. That will never happen again. So... Prepare for war! - No! You prepare for war. I have to do one more thing real quick. Kings! Kings! C'mon guys! What's it with you and the... executions... and the gallows... and the stocks... and the war?! Seriously, war?

I Listen to me i Peace, love and understanding i Is there no place for them today? i They say we must fight to keep our freedom i But the Lord knows there's got to be a better way i War i Good God, y'all! What is it good for?! i Say it! War! i What is it good for?! i Stand up and Shout it! i Bravo! Lilliput is free. Gonna miss Your big friend? A little. ""Yeah? A lot... - Oh, dear.

Oops, sorry. - Danny! Here are your morning mails, Gulliver. Thank you. Who's your friend? I'm Mark, just the new guy in the Mailroom. Oh, just the Mailroom? Mailroom's 'Whozat', right, Dan? Yeah, I don't know why he would say that 'coz there's where all the great start, y'know. Remember, there's no small jobs. Just small people. Teeny, tiny, teeny little people. Haven't I told you that? No small jobs, tiny, tiny people. Can I take you for lunch? Of course you can. My fair 'Princess'.

49,2010,The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,American,"In Seattle, not far from Forks, Victoria is still vengeful on Bella for James’s death. Learning that Laurent is killed by wolves and to replace him and James, she attacks and bites Riley Biers in order to begin creating an army of newborns, who are many times stronger during their first few months than older vampires. Back in Forks, Edward Cullen and Bella Swan resume their relationship, and discuss the complications of becoming a vampire. At eighteen years old, one year older than Edward was when he became a vampire, Bella dislikes the idea of marrying so young, though Edward refuses to turn her into a vampire until they are married, his argument being that she should have a normal, human life. While Bella's father, Charlie Swan, investigates the disappearance of Riley Biers, Edward suspects his disappearance was caused by Victoria and her newborn's army, furthering his suspicions of Riley Biers' intrusion into Bella's bedroom to steal her red blouse.
Bella insists that Jacob Black and the rest of the wolf pack would never harm her. Bella wants to go to Jacob's home, even though Edward expresses his dislike of Jacob and concern for her safety, but she returns unharmed. During one of her visits, Jacob confesses that he is in love with Bella, and forcefully kisses her. Furious, she punches him and sprains her hand, and Edward later threatens Jacob and tells him to only kiss her if she asks him to. Bella even revokes the invitations of Jacob and his pack members to her graduation party at the Cullen house, but when Jacob apologizes for his behavior, she forgives him and lets him and the wolf pack attend the party.
Meanwhile, Alice sees a vision that the newborn army will attack Forks within the week, led by Riley Biers. Jacob, accompanied by Quil and Embry, overhear this, which leads to an alliance between the Cullens and wolf pack. Later, the Cullens and the wolves agree to a meeting place and time to train and discuss strategy against the powerful newborns. During their training Jasper explains to Bella that he was a Major in the Confederate Army during the Civil War, and he was created by a vampire named Maria to control a newborn army. He eventually realized that Maria used him to fulfill her own ambitions. He didn't know there was another way until he met Alice and joined the Cullens. Bella sees the true bond between a mated vampire pair and begins to understand Jasper better. Despite her reluctance to marry young, Bella realizes that spending eternity with Edward is more important to her than anything else and accepts his marriage proposal, along with his late mother's engagement ring. Edward and Bella camp in the mountains to hide Bella from the bloodthirsty newborns. During the night, Bella overhears a conversation between Edward and Jacob, in which they temporarily put aside their hatred towards each other. In the morning, Jacob overhears Edward and Bella discussing their engagement and is furious. Bella desperately asks Jacob to kiss her, and she realizes that she loves him. Edward learns about the kiss but is not upset, because Bella says she loves him more than Jacob.
When Victoria appears, Edward kills her while Seth kills Riley. The Cullens and the wolves, meanwhile, destroy her ""army"", though Jacob is injured saving Leah from a newborn. Several members of the vampire overlords, the Volturi, arrive to deal with the newborn army, and are surprised the Cullens weren't killed. They also see that the Cullens are guarding the newborn, Bree Tanner, who had refused to fight and surrendered to Carlisle. Jane briefly tortures Bree to get information, then has Felix kill her, despite the Cullens' efforts to spare her. Carlisle treats Jacob at his home, and Bella visits him to tell him that even though she loves him, she has chosen Edward. Devastated by her choice, Jacob reluctantly agrees not to come between her and Edward.
Bella and Edward go to the meadow, where she tells him she has decided to do things his way: Get married, have a normal honeymoon, then be transformed into a vampire. She also explains that she never has been normal and never will be, that she's felt out of place her entire life, but when she is in Edward's world she feels stronger and complete. At the end of the story, they know they need to tell Charlie about their engagement, for which Bella is happy Edward is ""bulletproof.""",5.0,tt1325004,"Took a job Working late Jacking cars from out of state Who's there?

You gotta embrace the clichés, Jess. They are the bread and butter of all valedictorians. And that is why you are not valedictorian. Jess doesn't need clichés. The speech is gonna be epic. Epic? It'll change lives. I've decided to throw a party. After all, how many times are we gonna graduate high school? A party? At your place? I've never seen your house. No one's ever seen their house. Another party, Alice? It'll be fun. Yeah. That's what you said last time. - Hey, Angela. - Yeah? Do you need some help with those? ...be sending money 'cause it's the polite thing to do, and then you'll be raking it in. Wait a minute. People give you money? I know you know what she saw. Tell me. It was nothing. You looked worried. Just that everyone noticed how strange Alice is. I think that ship sailed long ago. I wonder what's wrong. Their son went missing in Seattle over a year ago. Charlie's doing what he can, but... You know something about this? We've been tracking the situation in Seattle for a while. Unexplained disappearances. Killings. If the situation gets any more conspicuous, the Volturi will step in. If they go to Seattle, they could come here. They could see I'm still human. It won't get that far. But we'll go to Seattle if we have to. - I'll fax these down, first thing. - Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. - You ready for dinner? - Yeah. It is still just you and I, right? No, I'm just dropping her off. See you later. Bye. Bella, my parents wanted to remind you about the airline ticket - you got for your birthday. - What airline ticket? A round trip ticket to see Mom in Florida. That was generous. It expires soon, so you might want to use it this weekend. Well, I can't just drop everything and go. It might be your last chance to see her before you graduate. Might not be a bad idea. Get out of town for a couple days. Get some distance. Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing Mom. As long as you use the companion ticket. Wait. There's two tickets? Super. That makes me really happy. I did want to see my mom. I wanted to know that her life was full and satisfying. Aren't you gonna miss this? Can't you just feel the vitamin D soaking up in your pores? Yeah, I am gonna miss this. You know, colleges in Florida are a lot sunnier. I'm just saying, if you go to the University of Alaska, I'm never gonna see you. They have a really great science program. You mean, Edward program? The way he watches you, it's like he's willing to leap in front of you and take a bullet or something. Is that a bad thing? It's an intense thing. You're different with him. He moves, you move. Like magnets. I don't know, we're just... In love. I get it. I just want to make sure you're making the right choices for you. You know, 'cause you're the one that's gonna have to live with them. All right, enough with the heavy. Mom. Congraduation. I didn't want you to spend any of your money. I didn't, come on. - Are these all our old trip T-shirts? - Mmm-hmm. - Get out! - I saved them all. I thought they'd make a good quilt, keep you warm up in Alaska. Remember this one? Ensenada. - The Snake Pit. - Yeah. But this one is my favorite, here. The three-headed lobster from Maine. - This is amazing. - Honey, I'm glad you like it. I just figured, you know, when you get older, have kids, we can add to it. Maybe go visit the world's largest ketchup bottle or something. Thanks. I'm glad you like it. Just thought you should have a little piece of me up there in Alaska. - Mom... - Yeah? I miss you. Honey, I miss you, too. Are you sure this is where you saw her? She's almost here. On your left! Wait! She's in their territory. She'll get away! No, she won't! Emmett, no! Do you regret going? No. It was really great seeing my mom. Just really hard saying goodbye. It doesn't have to be goodbye. Is that why you asked me to go? You thought I was gonna change my mind? I'm always hoping for that. What? If I asked you to stay in the car, would you? Of course not. Hey. Charlie said you left town. Yeah. To visit my mom. Why? He's checking to see if you're still human. Look, I'm here to warn you. If your kind come on our land again... Wait, what? You didn't tell her? Just leave it alone, Jacob. Tell me what? Emmett and Paul had a misunderstanding. It's nothing to worry about. Listen to you. Did you lie to get her out of town, too? You should just leave. Now. She has a right to know. She is the one the redhead wants. Victoria? Alice's vision. I was trying to protect you. By lying to me. Okay, we're gonna talk about this, but... You. Why haven't you called me back? I had nothing to say. - Well, I have tons. Hold on. - Hey. Bella. Edward, you have to trust me. I do trust you. It's him I don't trust. Hey, lose the grin, Jacob. We're just going for a ride. Hold on tight. Last born of the clan First one to be free Lived inside a house Are you sure this is a good idea? I am the vampire girl, remember? Hey, look who's back! What up, Bella? - Quil? You, too? - Yep. Finally made the pack. I'm glad you're here, Bella. Maybe we can get a break from Jake's obsessive inner monologue. ""I wish Bella would call."" ""I wish Bella wouldn't call."" - ""Maybe I should call Bella."" - ""Maybe I should call Bella and hang up."" All right, you can shut up now. Bella, this is Leah Clearwater, Harry's daughter. Hey. I'm really sorry about your father. If you're here to torture Jacob some more, feel free to leave. Fun, isn't she? - Bella, hi! - Hey. I was wondering when we'd see your face around here again. Yeah. Same here. Sam, we good? We're good. She won't be getting through our line any time soon. - Cool. - Yeah, that's right boys! So when did Leah join the pack? Around when her dad died. Her brother, Seth, also phased. He's only 15, one of the youngest we've had. Sam keeps him home studying, but he's chomping at the bit. I wish it was Leah who'd stay home. Come on, don't be such a guy. No, it's not a chick thing. It's, you know, a triangle thing. We all have to live the LeahlSamlEmily pain-fest. Wolf telepathy, remember? So Sam dumps Leah for Emily? Yeah, it wasn't like that. Sam hates himself for hurting Leah. But Emily was the one. I guess it sort of chooses you sometimes. It's more than some crush, Bella. Sam imprinted on Emily. Do I even want to know what that is? Imprinting on someone is like... Like when you see her, everything changes. All of a sudden, it's not gravity holding you to the planet. It's her. Nothing else matters. You would do anything, be anything for her. Sounds like you know the feeling. Have you imprinted on someone? You'd know if I had. I just have a direct line to Sam's thoughts. So for now you're still you. And you're still you. Yeah. Until graduation. Graduation? You knew this was gonna happen. Not in a month! I mean, not before you've... You've even lived. Or before I could... For a second, just a second, I thought... But he's got his hooks in you so deep... I decided this, not him. Bella, they're not even alive. It makes me sick. Better you really be dead than one of them. I can't believe you said that. Edward was right, I shouldn't have come. Bella, come on. Please. I'm sorry. You know, Edward could at least respect meal times. I was just with Jake. Oh. Good. I'll just give you two some privacy, then. - Hey. - Do you understand how worried I've been? I was perfectly safe. I almost broke the treaty to make sure. - I know I smell like a dog. I'm sorry. - No, something's wrong. Edward, what's wrong? Someone's been in here. Who was it? Someone we know? This stranger, I didn't recognize his scent. A nomad passing through? A passerby wouldn't have left Bella's father alive. The scent disappeared about miles south of Bella's house. Someone's orchestrating this. Victoria? I would have seen her decide. Has to be the Volturi. I don't think it's the Volturi, either. I've been watching Aro's decisions, too. So we keep looking. We'll also take shifts guarding Bella at her house. Another protection detail? Rosalie. No, she's right. You can't protect me, watch my dad and search for the intruder. And for Victoria. And keep yourselves fed. I'm not leaving you here defenseless. Well, I'm not gonna let you starve. And I wouldn't be unprotected. I have... What? Whoever it was, he left his stink behind. It'll be hard to miss when we cross it again. We'll handle it from here. We don't need you to handle anything. Or anyone. I could care less what you need. All right, we're done here. - No, you're done here. - Stop! I'm tired of this. From now on, I'm Switzerland, okay? Edward hated the idea, but it wasn't about rivalry anymore. It was about my safety, and Charlie's. In the days that followed, I got them to at least try to work together. The wolves took over so the Cullens could hunt. It wasn't exactly an easy alliance. Doesn't he own a shirt? I'm good here. You should go. I'm not gonna be gone long. Don't rush. You need to hunt. Maybe rush a little bit. - Hey, beautiful. - Hi. So, what do you wanna do today? Bike, hike, just hang? Your call. But we're going to a party tonight. Are you sure this is okay? I really hate being a party crasher. Technically, you're a council meeting crasher. You see? The council leaders, Dad, Quil's grandpa and Sue Clearwater. She took over for Harry when he died. Okay, I should not be here. You're okay. I thought... I mean, they thought it would be good for you to hear the histories. The histories? The tribe's histories? Aren't they secret? We all got a role to play, and you're part of this. I mean, it's the first time Seth, Leah and Quil'll hear them, too. But you are the first outsider. Ever. If I had known that, I would have, like... - I don't know, dressed better. - Jake! - Hey. - It's about time you got here. Paul's been hoovering the grub, but I saved you some burgers. Good looking out, bro. Bella, this is Seth Clearwater, Leah's brother. - Hi. - Newest member of the pack. Newest. Bestest. Brightest. And slowest. - Come on, your dad's about to start. - Okay. The Quileutes have been a small tribe from the beginning, but we have always had magic in our blood. We were great spirit warriors, shape-shifters that transformed to the powerful wolf. This enabled us to scare off our enemies and protect our tribe. One day, our warriors came across a creature. It looked like a man, but it was hard like stone and cold as ice. Our warriors' sharp teeth finally tore it apart, but only fire would completely destroy it. They lived in fear that the cold man was not alone. And they were right. She took her vengeance out on the village. Our elder chief, Taha Aki, was the only spirit warrior left to save the tribe after his son was killed. Taha Aki's third wife could see that he would lose. The third wife was no magical being, with no special powers but one, courage. The third wife's sacrifice distracted the cold woman long enough for Taha Aki to destroy her. She saved the tribe. Over time, our enemies have disappeared. But one remains, the cold ones. Our magic awakens when they're near, and we sense it now. We feel the threat in our blood. Something terrible is coming, and we must all be ready, all of us. What did you do to me? I'm so... Yeah. I know. We'll find you someone to drink. Mine! Just try not to get killed, will you? I'm gonna need numbers. Seattle is in a state of terror. Police are baffled by the escalating murders and disappearances. Theories range from a vicious new gang to a wildly active serial killer. Reporting live... It's getting worse. We're going to have to do something. It takes more than one of our kind to cause the damage they're reporting. Quite a few more. And they're undisciplined, conspicuous. It's newborns. What, like new vampires? In the first few months after the change. That's when we're at our most uncontrollable. Vicious. Insane with thirst. Something to look forward to. No one's trained these newborns, but this isn't random. Someone's creating an army. Well, now we're definitely going to Seattle. An army of vampires? And they've been created to fight someone. We're the only clan even close to Seattle. Regardless of why they were made, if we don't put a stop to them, the Volturi will. I'm surprised they've let it go on this long. Maybe they're behind it. In Italy, I read Aro's mind. He wants me and Alice to join him, but he knows we'll never choose him as long as our family's still alive. An army could solve that for him. Hey. Did you eat dinner yet? No, I haven't. This kid, Riley Biers, disappeared over a year ago, and his poor parents have been papering Seattle with these things ever since. You think they should just give up? Well, I wouldn't if it were you. Not ever. I have to figure out what to tell people. Why I won't be home for Christmases, and why I won't visit, why they'll never see me again. After a few decades, everyone you know will be dead. Problem solved. Why are you so against me becoming like you? I've told you. Be honest with me. There's more. I know the consequences of this choice you're making. I've lived through it. And to let you suffer that... You believe I have a soul, and I don't. But to risk yours, just for the sake of never having to lose you, that's the most selfish thing I'll ever do. I thought that you were afraid that I'd be too different. You know, like, I wouldn't be warm, and I wouldn't smell the same. You'll always be my Bella. My Bella, just less fragile. Gosh, it's so pretty here. So, Alice has planned a big graduation party. Which you're invited to. Yeah, I figured that. What? I just wanted to do this differently. Smoother. But now I'm out of time. Do what? You need to hear the truth, Bella, understand all your options. And you need to know that I'm in love with you, and I want you to choose me instead of him. I thought you understood. - I don't feel that way for you. - I don't buy it. What don't you buy? That's how I feel. You feel something else for me. You just won't admit it. So I'm not giving up. I'm gonna fight for you until your heart stops beating. Well, then you're not gonna have to fight for long. You're rushing into it because you're afraid you'll change your mind. No, I'm not. I know what I want. You wouldn't have to change for me, Bella, or say goodbye to anybody. I can give you more than him. I mean, he probably can't even kiss you without hurting you. Feel that? Flesh and blood. And warmth. God! God! Edward! If you ever touch her against her will again... - Don't do this here! - She's not sure what she wants. - Don't do this here! - Let me give you a clue. Wait for her to say the words. Fine! And she will. Jacob, just go, okay? Hey, hey, hey! Easy, guys. Easy. Let's take it down a notch. All right? What's going on? I kissed Bella. And she broke her hand. Punching my face. Total misunderstanding. It's just a sprain. It should heal fairly quickly. Trying to walk and chew gum at the same time again, Bella? I punched a werewolf in the face. Badass. You're gonna be one tough little newborn. Tough enough to take you on. Don't worry about it. Got any leads? No sign of the intruder. But Victoria continues to make appearances. Go blather to someone else about the joys of becoming a newborn. Okay... Rosalie, I don't understand what I did to make you hate me so much. Hate... I don't hate you. I don't particularly like you, but... Bella, I envy you. What? - That's ridiculous. - No, it's not. You have a choice. I didn't. None of us did. But you do, and you're choosing wrong. I don't care how miserable your human life is. My life is not miserable. I mean, it's not perfect. Nobody's life is perfect. Mine was. Absolutely perfect. There were things I still wanted, to be married, with a nice house and a husband to kiss me when he came home, a family of my own. Royce King was the most eligible bachelor in town. I barely knew him. But I was young. I was in love with the idea of love. On the last night of my life, I left a friend's house late. I wasn't far from home. There she is. Hey, Rose! Come over here! Here. Hold this. Hey, come over here. We've been waiting for you. There she is. Royce. Royce! You're drunk. Isn't she lovely, John? I told you she was a looker. It's hard to say with all those clothes on. What do you say, Rose? - Why don't we take off a few layers? - Stop it, stop it. Stop. Stop! I'll see you tomorrow. Sober. Hey, where do you think you're going? - I said, get... Come back... Hey! - Stop! Stop! Get off me! - You'll do as I say! - Let go of me! Stop! Stop! Let go! Stop! They left me in the street, thinking I was dead. Believe me, I wanted to be. Carlisle found me. He smelled all the blood. - Thought he was helping me. - I'm sorry. I got my revenge on them. One at a time. Saved Royce for last, so he'd know I was coming. I was a little theatrical back then. Things got better after I found Emmett. But we'll always be this. Frozen. Never moving forward. That's what I miss the most. Possibilities. Sitting on a front porch somewhere, Emmett, gray-haired, by my side, surrounded by our grandchildren. Their laughter. I understand that that's what you want. But there's nothing I'm ever gonna want more than Edward. You're wrong again. After you've been changed, there's one thing you'll want more, one thing you'll kill for. Blood. What did I say about a low profile? Something's coming. Something bigger than any of us alone. And if you can't control yourselves, we're all going to die. What's done is done, just clean up after yourselves. They've already drawn too much attention. So has our inaction. Others may begin to question the Volturi's effectiveness. Let them. Maybe we should consult with Aro. Aro's decisions are being watched. We must decide. Then decide, sister. It's time. Yes, it is. Either we let them do what they were created for, or we end them. Decisions, decisions. When we were five, they asked us what we wanted to be when we grew up. Our answers were things like astronaut, president, or, in my case, a princess. When we were 10, they asked again. We answered rock star, cowboy or, in my case, a gold medalist. But now that we've grown up, they want a serious answer. Well, how about this? Who the hell knows? Yeah! This isn't the time to make hard-and-fast decisions. This is the time to make mistakes. Take the wrong train and get stuck somewhere. Fall in love a lot. Major in philosophy, because there's no way to make a career out of that. Change your mind, and change it again, because nothing's permanent. So make as many mistakes as you can. That way, someday, when they ask what we want to be, we won't have to guess. We'll know. You made it! Hey. What did you think of my speech? Too easy-breezy? Too self-helpful? You hated it? - No. I think you pretty much nailed it. - Yeah? It's like I was born to lead, right? I love this song! Let's go. What are you doing here? You invited me, remember? Was my right hook too subtle for you? That was me uninviting you. Look, Bella, I'm sorry about, you know, the kiss and your hand. I'd blame it on the whole inner animal thing, but it was really just me being an ass. I'm really sorry. I brought you something. A graduation present. I made it myself. Wow. You made this? It's really pretty. Thanks. I'll be right back. - Alice, what'd you see? - The decision's been made. What's going on? - You're not going to Seattle. - No. They're coming here. They'll be here in four days. This could turn into a bloodbath. Who's behind it? I didn't see anyone I recognized. Maybe one. I know his face. He's local. Riley Biers. He didn't start this. Whoever did is staying out of the action. They must be playing with the blind spots in your vision. Either way, the army is coming and there aren't enough of us to protect the town. Hold up. What damn army? Newborns. Our kind. What are they after? They were passing around Bella's scent. A red blouse. They're after Bella? What the hell does this mean? It means an ugly fight. With lives lost. All right. We're in. No. You'd get yourselves killed. No way. I wasn't asking for permission. Edward? It means more protection for you. Jacob, do you believe Sam would agree to an understanding? As long as we get to kill some vampires. Jasper? They'll give us the numbers. Newborns won't know they even exist. That'll give us an edge. We'll need to coordinate. - Carlisle, they're gonna get hurt. - We'll all need some training. Fighting newborns requires knowledge that Jasper has. You're welcome to join us. All right. Name the time and place. Jake, you don't know what you're getting yourself into. Bella, this is what we do. You should be happy. Look at us, working together. You are the one who wanted us to get along. Remember? Again! It's a graduation present. They don't trust us enough to be in their human forms. They came. That's what matters. Will you translate? Hey, Jake. Welcome. Jasper has experience with newborns. He'll teach us how to defeat them. They want to know how the newborns differ from us. They're a great deal stronger than us because their own human blood lingers in their tissues. Our kind is never more physically powerful than in our first several months of this life. Carlisle's right. That's why they are created. A newborn army doesn't need thousands like a human army, but no human army could stand against them. Now, the two most important things to remember are, first, never let them get their arms around you. They'll crush you instantly. And second, never go for the obvious kill. They'll be expecting that, and you will lose. Emmett. Even if they stick to humming Holding on a song to see them - Don't hold back. - Not in my nature. Sick of, sick of, sick of love When you went down, the men came callin' Changing to stone as you wept from fallin' Never lose focus. When you went down, the men came callin' Changing to stone as you wept from fallin' One more thing. Never turn your back on your enemy. Singing in tones that makes things summer I got the skills I'm in love with you Everything you taught me, honey It never even mattered really This song's about my love for you Some of you are gonna get hurt. Some of you could get killed because of me. It's gonna be times worse than this, right? Done for the day. Jasper? Are you sure there's nothing I can do to help? Well, your presence alone, your scent, will distract the newborns. Their hunting instinct will take over and drive them crazy. Good. I'm glad. Hey. How do you know so much about this? I didn't have quite the same upbringing as my adopted siblings. - Those bites are like mine. - Battle scars. All the training the Confederate Army gave me was useless against the newborns. Still, I never lost a fight. This happened during the Civil War? I was the youngest major in the Texas cavalry, all without having seen any real battle. Until? Till I met a certain immortal. Maria. I was riding back to Galveston after evacuating a column of women and children when I saw them. I immediately offered them my aid. Lovely. And an officer. You'd better do it, Maria. I can never stop once I've started. - What's your name, soldier? - Major Jasper Whitlock, ma'am. I hope you survive. You may be of great use to me. - Maria was creating an army? - They were very common in the South. There were constant brutal battles for territory. Maria won them all. She was smart, careful, and she had me. I was her second in command. My ability to control emotions served her well. I trained her newborns, an endless occupation since she never let them live beyond their first year. It was my job to dispose of them. I could feel everything they felt. I thought what Maria and I had was love. But I was her puppet. She pulled the strings. I didn't know there was another way till I found Alice. Now, she'd seen me coming, of course. You kept me waiting long enough. My apologies, ma'am. I don't know what I'd have become without her. You never have to be that again. Jasper. I want you to do something for me. Kill her. What is it? The intruder, the newborn army, they're all her puppets. Victoria. Alice would have seen if she wanted to make an army. Unless she's hiding behind them and she's letting someone else decide. Welcome to the army. I'm not just gonna hide while you're out taking all the risks for me. If it's Victoria involved, I need to keep you as far away from the fight as possible. - Jasper said that I could be of help. - We won't need your help. With the wolves in this, it's an easy win. The rest of us aren't gonna have enough to do. Okay. Either it's so dangerous that I have to hide or it's so easy that you're gonna be sidelined. Which is it? It's dangerous for you, it's easy for us. I think it's dangerous for us to be apart. How many times do we have to prove that? I'll be worried. You'll be worried. And we'll both be more vulnerable. Okay, you're right. - So I'm coming with you. - No, we both stay away together. I can't make you choose between me and your family. The only way I can protect you is to be with you. You're not fighting? What, did you pull a muscle or something? - He's doing it for me, okay? - Whatever. Just tell me the plan. This field will give us an advantage in battle. We need to lure the newborns with Bella's scent, but it needs to end here. Edward and I are going to a campsite. Even if he carries me, they'll still pick up on our scents. Your stench, however, is revolting. Dude, you really don't wanna start comparing stinks. What he means is that your scent will mask mine if you carry me. - Done. - This is not a good idea. Edward, they won't want to get anywhere near his odor. Okay. Let's just try it. - Eau de wolf coming up. - Run. So you gonna ask me to sit out of the fight, too? Or don't you care about my safety? - Of course, I care. But you'd say no. - I won't have a choice, anyways. Since I let Sam be alpha male, I gotta live with the shots he calls. Since you let Sam be alpha? I didn't wanna be in a pack, let alone be its leader. Wow. - Chief Jacob. - Opted out. But every choice has its consequences. - Some more than others. - Don't start. Everybody makes choices. You're gonna have to accept mine. But you can love more than one person at a time. I've seen it. With Sam, Emily and Leah. - Well, I'm not a wolf. I can't imprint. - It has nothing to do with imprinting. It has to do with feeling something for somebody. And I know you feel something for me. I can sense how I make you feel, physically. I make you nervous. Jake. Don't worry. I promised I wouldn't kiss you again till you asked. You're gonna be keeping that promise for a while, chief. All I picked up was wolf stench. No Bella. - This will work. - Great. Yes. Scout's honor. - Okay, Alice, don't be a stranger. - Okay. - Your alibi for the battle is all arranged. - Really? I told your father that our whole family's going camping this weekend, so you and I are having a sleepover at my house. - Charlie's going fishing, anyway. - Charlie? - You guys are on first name basis now? - Me, he likes. Actually, you and Edward will have the house to yourself tonight. Like alone? We're all going hunting. Powering up for the battle. You're welcome. - Hey. You want a sandwich? - No, I'm good. Well, the sister, I like. Alice. Yeah, she's great. Hey, Dad, I was wondering. Why didn't you get remarried? After Mom. I don't know. Guess I still haven't met the right gal. - Why? - I don't know. I thought you just maybe gave up on the whole institution of it, of marriage. But do you think there's any value in it? Yeah. Yeah, marriage has value. When you're older. Much older. Like your mother. It seemed to work out fine for her the second time around, - later in life. - Yeah, I guess. I mean, you definitely don't wanna have to get married because you weren't careful. - What? - Look, you know what I'm talking about. There's things you need to think about if you're gonna be physically intimate. Okay. Don't have ""the talk"" with me, please. Well, it's just as embarrassing for me as it is for you. I doubt that. And don't bother, 'cause Mom beat you to it like years ago. Well, you didn't have a boyfriend years ago. I'm sure things work the same way. All right, so... You guys are taking precautions and... Okay, Dad, please, just don't worry about that. Edward is old school. Old school. Great. What's that? Like, code for something? Oh, my God. Dad. I'm a virgin. - Okay! Good. Glad we covered that. - Me, too. Virgin. I'm liking Edward a little bit more now. What are you doing outside? What's wrong? Nothing. It seems only fair that I be represented, as well. It's really pretty. Thanks. There's a bed. I thought you might need one to sleep in. I think an air mattress would have sufficed. - Is this too much? - No. No, it's perfect. - I wanna ask you something. - Anything. Okay, marriage is the condition for you to change me yourself, right? Yes. Okay. I wanna negotiate my own condition. Anything you want. It's yours. You promise? Yeah. Okay. Hey. Bella. No. But you said that you wanted me to have every human experience. - Not ones that will risk killing you. - You won't. And everyone says once I'm changed all I'll want is to slaughter the whole town. - That part doesn't last forever. - I want you. While I'm still me. While I still want you this way. - It's too dangerous. - Try. Just try. I'll go to some ridiculously expensive college and let you buy me a car. I'll marry you. Just try. You were searching For release You took my hand Added a plan You gave me your heart I know you're pleased to go Stop trying to take your clothes off. - You wanna do that part? - Not tonight. You... You mean, you don't... That's fine. Believe me, I want to. I just want to be married to you first. You really make me feel like I'm some sort of villain trying to steal your virtue or something. It's not my virtue I'm concerned about. Are you kidding? It's just one rule I wanna leave unbroken. It might be too late for my soul, but I will protect yours. I know that's not a modern notion. It's not modern. It's ancient. I'm from a different era. Things were a lot less complicated. And if I'd have met you back then, I would have courted you. We'd have taken chaperoned strolls and iced tea on the porch. I may have stolen a kiss or two, but only after asking your father's permission. I would have got down on one knee, and I would have presented you with a ring. This was my mother's. Isabella Swan, I promise to love you every moment of forever. And would you do me the extraordinary honor of marrying me? Yes. You're not coming with us? It'll be a last minute decision. - I told you how it works. - The Cullens have powers. Don't underestimate them, Riley. You'll have the numbers, but they'll be able to anticipate your every move. - According to your friend? - Yes. My dead friend. Laurent found out about the things they could do, and they killed him. But not before he told me. Maybe he was wrong. I mean, this is supposed to be Cullen territory. We've been tearing it up and I've never even seen them here. You don't trust me. - With my life. I'm just saying... - I'm doing this for us. So that we can feed without their retaliation. I can't live in fear anymore, waiting for them to attack. I won't let them. I am going to end the Cullen clan. I swear. I love you so much. You're going overboard. If this is all I can contribute, I wanna be thorough. The newborns'll be frantic. It's okay. Don't make yourself uncomfortable. It doesn't bother me anymore. Since when? Since I spent hours thinking you were dead. You're not wearing your ring. Well, I didn't want to risk losing it. Or risk Jacob seeing it. I think we should wait to tell him. I mean, at least till after the fight. - If you're having second thoughts... - I'm not. - I just want him to have a clear head. - Whose head is unclear? Nobody's I hope. - Alice says there's a storm coming. - Yeah, I can feel it. We should get going. I'll see you in a couple of hours. Something up? - Bunch of vampires trying to kill me. - Same old same old. Thank you. - You should get back before the storm hits. - No, I'm staying. You'll need my connection to the pack to keep tabs on what's going on. - You're not gonna fight? - Seth will spell me in the morning. He's not happy about missing the action but it'll keep him out of trouble. Let's get you inside. - I should have chosen a site lower down. - No, it's fine. I'm okay. What can I do? I can't sleep with all that teeth chattering going on. - Forget it. - She may need her toes someday. And let's face it, I am hotter than you. - Get your hand off me. - Keep your hands off her. Don't fight. If she gets sick, it's on you. Wow, you're freezing, Bella. Relax. You'll warm up soon. Faster if you took your clothes off. - Jake. - Survival 101. Can you at least attempt to control your thoughts? I really get under that ice-cold skin of yours, don't I? What? Are you doubting her feelings for you? Nice. So picking through my brain's okay, but letting me into yours, forget it. Look. - I know she's in love with you. - Good. But she's in love with me, too. She just won't admit it to herself. I can't tell if you're right. Then let me ask you something. - If she chooses me... - She won't. If she did, would you try to kill me? That's an intriguing idea. But, no. I couldn't hurt her like that. So you'd just turn her into a blood-sucking demon like you? I don't want that. I never wanted that. - So stop her. - I tried. - I left. - But you gave up too quickly. If you'd stayed away another months, I could've made her happy. Trust me. You have to consider that I might be better for her than you are. I have considered that. I know you can protect her. But you can give her a life, a human life. That's all I want for her. But I'm not... I'm not going to force her into anything ever again. The last time I tried, it almost killed us both. Yeah. That I remember. When you thought she was gone, that you'd lost her, how did you cope? There are no words. But I wouldn't wish it on anyone, Jacob. This might sound odd, but I'm glad you're here. Meaning, ""As much as I'd love to kill you, I'm glad she's warm."" If we weren't natural enemies and you weren't trying to steal my reason for existing, I might actually like you. Well, if you weren't planning on sucking the life out of the girl I love, I might... No. Not even then. But she could still change her mind, you know. Then I'd let her go. Right. Hey, Seth. - Where's Jacob? Did he already... - Not yet. He's checking to see if the woods are clear before he goes. I'm really sorry about last night. That couldn't have been easy on you. It definitely won't make my list of top favorite evenings. - You have a list? - All I spent with you. Number one is when you said you'd marry me, Mrs. Cullen. This is the 21st century. I at least want to hyphenate my name. - You're marrying him? - Jake, I... - You knew he was listening! - He deserves to know. - Jake, stop! - Bella, let him... Don't! Jake, stop! - Jake, please! - I'm done! I'm so done! What can I do? You can't do anything. I can, by going out there and killing something. No! You're not thinking clearly! Don't do that! Maybe I'll get myself killed and make it simple for you. No! Just, Jake, stay. Why? Give me one good reason. Because I don't wanna lose you. It's not good enough. Because you're too important. - Still not good enough. - Jacob! Kiss me. I'm asking you to kiss me. That should have been our first kiss. I gotta go. I'll be back. - You saw. - No, but... Jacob's thoughts are pretty loud. I don't know what happened. You love him. I love you more. I know. It's starting. Jacob just got there. He's good. Someone's hurt? She's close. I can hear her thoughts. Seth, go. She knew we weren't there, but she caught my scent. She knew you'd be with me. She found us. She's not alone. Riley, listen to me. Victoria's just using you to distract me. She knows I'll kill you. In fact, she'll be glad she doesn't have to deal with you anymore. Don't listen, Riley. I told you about their mind tricks. I can read her mind. So I know what she thinks of you. He's lying. She only created you and this army to avenge her true mate, James. That's the only thing she cares about. Not you. There's only you. You know that. Think about it. You're from Forks. You know the area. That's the only reason she chose you. She doesn't love you. Riley. Don't let him do this to us. You know I love you. You're dead. You won't get another chance like this again. You want her. You want me to feel the pain you felt when I killed James, when I tore him to pieces, when I turned him into ash, when I turned him into nothing. Victoria! Victoria! Victoria! - Something is wrong. - Alice needs us to go. Now. - How long? - A few minutes. Maybe 10? The pack needs to leave. The Volturi won't honor a truce with the werewolves. Leah, don't! Jacob! Jacob. Hold on. Carlisle's gonna take care of you. The bones on the right half of his body are shattered. - Bella. - Jake, I'm right here. - Jacob, you idiot, I had it! - Leah! I need to set the bones before his accelerated healing kicks in. - It's already starting. - We need to get him out of here. We're not gonna win a fight with the Volturi. - We'll take him back to Billy's. - I'll be there soon as I can. Hang in there, Jake. - It's okay. We got you. - We got you. They're coming. Impressive. I've never seen a coven escape an assault of this magnitude intact. We were lucky. I doubt that. - It appears we missed an entertaining fight. - Yes. It's not often we're rendered unnecessary. If you'd arrived a half hour ago, you would have fulfilled your purpose. Pity. You missed one. We offered her asylum in exchange for her surrender. That wasn't yours to offer. Why did you come? Who created you? You don't need to do that. She'll tell you anything you want to know. I know. I don't know! Riley wouldn't tell us. He said our thoughts weren't safe. Her name was Victoria. Perhaps you knew her. Edward, if the Volturi had knowledge of Victoria, they would have stopped her. Isn't that right, Jane? Of course. Felix. She didn't know what she was doing. We'll take responsibility for her. Give her a chance. The Volturi don't give second chances. Keep that in mind. Caius will be interested to know that she's still human. The date is set. Take care of that, Felix. I'd like to go home. Hey. - It's been going on for a while. - Doc's re-breaking his bones. Why did he have to butt in? I could've taken that tick. Give it a rest, Leah. The worst is over. He'll be all right. I gave him some morphine, but his body temperature will burn it off soon. I'll come back to set up a drip. Thank you. He's asking for you. Hey, Jake. Hey. - I was worried about you. - You were worried about me? Yeah. I guessed Edward would read my thoughts. - Was he hard on you? - He wasn't even mad at me. Or you. Well, damn. - He's better than I thought. - He's not playing a game. Right. Bella. He's not as perfect as you think. I know who he is. Can we just not talk about that? I'd rather get all the re-breaking done at once. Well, at least I know I did everything I could. It wasn't easy making you admit your feelings for me. I only fought them because I knew they wouldn't change anything. I'm exactly right for you, Bella. It would be as easy as breathing, with me. You know I love you. You know how much I wish it was enough. Should I come back? I need some time. But I'll always be waiting. Until my heart stops beating. Maybe even then. - August 13th? - Yeah. It's a month before my birthday. I don't need to be another year older than you. Alice said she could get the wedding together by then. I'm sure she can. There's no rush. I've chosen my life. I want to start living it. And so you're gonna let Alice plan the whole thing? The dress, the reception, the guest list. I mean, who knows who she's gonna invite? Does it matter? I just don't know why you're doing this. - What? The wedding? - No. You're trying to make everyone else happy, but you're already giving away too much. You're wrong. This wasn't a choice between you and Jacob. It was between who I should be and who I am. I've always felt out of step, like literally stumbling through my life. I've never felt normal. Because I'm not normal. I don't want to be. I've had to face death and loss and pain in your world, but I've also never felt stronger and more real, more myself. Because it's my world, too. It's where I belong. So it's not just about me? No. Sorry. I've made a mess trying to figure all this out, but I wanna do it right. And I wanna tie myself to you in every way humanly possible. Starting with a wedding. Actually, something a little more difficult first. And maybe even dangerous. We have to tell Charlie. It's highly dangerous. It's a good thing you're bulletproof. I'm gonna need that ring. All the lives Always tempted to trade Will they hate me For all the choices I've made Will they stop when they see me again? I can't stop now I know who I am Now I'm all yours I'm not afraid I'm yours always Say what they may And all your love I'll take to a grave And all my life Starts now Tear me down They can take you out of my thoughts Under every scar There's a battle I've lost Will they stop when they see us again? I can't stop now I know who I am Now I'm all yours I'm not afraid I'm yours always Say what they may And all your love I'll take to a grave And all my life starts I'm all yours I'm not afraid I'm yours always Say what they may And all your love I'll take to a grave And all my life starts Starts now I was a heavy heart to carry My beloved was weighed down My arms around his neck My fingers laced a crown I was a heavy heart to carry My feet dragged across the ground And he took me to the river Where he slowly let me drown My love has concrete feet My love's an iron ball Wrapped around your ankles Over the waterfall I'm so heavy Heavy Heavy in your arms I'm so heavy Heavy Heavy in your arms And is it worth the wait All this killing time? Are you strong enough to stand Protecting both your heart and mine? Who is the betrayer? Who's the killer in the crowd? The one who creeps in corridors And doesn't make a sound My love has concrete feet My love is an iron ball Wrapped around your ankles Over the waterfall My love has concrete feet My love's an iron ball Wrapped around your ankles Over the waterfall I'm so heavy Heavy Heavy in your arms I'm so heavy Heavy Heavy in your arms I was a heavy heart to carry My beloved was weighed down My arms around his neck My fingers laced a crown I was a heavy heart to carry But he never let me down When he held me in his arms My feet never touched the ground I'm so heavy I'm so heavy in your arms Run, run, run away So lost, lost Never comin' Home rollin', rollin' down a track No, no, I'm never comin' back Hot love pumpin' in my veins Our love, I hope it's not too late That's the road, that's the load That's the role I've been down, I've been down I've been down What part of forever Don't you understand? I could stay, stay, stay If that's what you want, want, want I'd give it to you, you, you If I had a heart, heart, heart And we could go, go, go And never look back on now I'd give it to you, you, you If I had a heart Imagine eternity Doesn't seem that hard They say nothing lasts forever We'll have to prove them wrong I could stay, stay, stay If that's what you want, want, want I'd give it to you, you, you If I had a heart And we could go, go, go And never look back on now I'd give it to you, you, you If I had a heart"
50,2007,Reign Over Me,American,"When the Twin Towers went down in 2001, Charlie Fineman lost everything important in his life. Five years have passed since Charlie's wife and daughters died, and now the once-successful and sociable man has become a withdrawn shadow of his former self. He does not discuss his loss, causing his in-laws to worry for his sanity, believing that he has struck the tragedy from his mind.
When fate brings Charlie and his former college roommate Alan Johnson together once again on a Manhattan street corner, Alan is shocked to see just how far his old friend has fallen. Charlie's hair is long and he wears a headset constantly to let music drown out the upsetting memories of his wife and children.
Though on the surface it would appear that Alan, a successful dentist, has it all, the pressures of a family and career have been weighing heavily on him. At a pivotal moment when Charlie and Alan both need a trusted friend, the restorative power of a rekindled friendship provides a lifeline needed to move forward.
Alan endeavors to bring Charlie out of his shell by convincing him to see a therapist. Charlie is barely communicative, however, ending every session after only a couple of minutes. His therapist says he needs to tell the story about his family to someone eventually. Charlie soon tells Alan his tragic story, but afterwards tries to commit suicide by cop and ends up in an asylum.
Legal proceedings commence, Judge David Raines (Donald Sutherland) must determine whether to commit Charlie to psychiatric care against his will. The judge leaves the decision to Charlie's in-laws, asking them to think of what their daughter would want for Charlie. He approaches his in-laws in the lobby of the courthouse, stating that he does not carry pictures nor discuss his family because he sees them every day, in the faces of people walking down the street. They decide that he should not be committed; instead, Charlie moves to a new apartment, leaving behind the painful memories associated with his former home. At the end of the film, Alan visits Charlie for the day and his wife calls and tells him ""I love you and just want you to come home.""",7.4,tt0490204,"-New patient? -Yes. I was referred by my lawyer about veneers. You're a new patient. Fill this out... ...so we know who to contact in case we lose you in the chair. That was a joke, sweetie. I was being funny. Hello. Mrs. Remar, I'm Dr. Johnson. Oh, it's Miss Remar. And I know who you are. I see another doctor in the building regularly. I've been on the elevator with you a few times. Oh, okay. You're married? I never noticed the ring before. Oh, yes, I am. I'm married. All right, what are we doing for you today? One veneer, is that right? They told me you don't usually do just one. We do whatever's needed. Allie. All right. Let's see. -Now, which one is it? -I don't know. You tell me. So another cutie with a crush, huh? What is it with you? So you'll be back next week? You're gonna schedule Miss Remar next week for the veneer. Right? Yeah. I'm gonna clear the schedule the whole week... ...so that you could be mentally prepared for it. Okay? It was so nice to finally meet you. Oh, yeah. You too. Okay. I need the-- Oh, it's my daughters. I'm gonna need that jacket. -Okay, you stay, and then I'll reach. -Sorry. No, that's fine. I'm minutes away. Charlie--? Hey, Charlie! Charlie Fineman! Charlie! Charlie. Charlie Fineman. I'm so sick of your father. He's in that bed again. Just as mean and evil as he can be. Like a pig with a bullet in his head. You take your walk today, Mom? I'll take that as a no. Dad? I hate this city. I hate this damn city. I don't know why you brought us here. I got the papaya juice you asked for. Hate this damn city. And the smell. All that garbage all up and down the street. Daddy? I need money for the dress for the dinner... ...I'm going to with the Jacobsons. And you'll have to drive me... ...because Mom's gonna be at Cherie's chorus practise. Okay. We have to talk about getting a cell phone. This morning, you said we could talk about it tonight. I thought we talked about the cell-phone issue. But I'm and I still share with my little sister. Oh, right. Because you only need a cell phone... -...if Mommy or Daddy's late-- -I ran into Charlie Fineman today. Really? How is he? I don't know. I was in the car and he was on foot. He was coming out of a hardware store. He was carrying paint. You think he's still practising? Who's Charlie Fineman, Daddy? He's an old college friend of mine, baby. He was my college roommate, actually. I haven't talked to him in a long, long time. Is he the one from dental school... ...whose family was on the plane? Is that Charlie Fineman? Yeah. That's Charlie Fineman. You know, I decided to sign us up for another photography class. You did? You already signed us up? Yeah, but this time for the advanced one. I thought we had fun last quarter, didn't you? What, you don't want to? No, I do. Don't you? I loved it. -I had a really good time. -Yeah. -Didn't you love it? -I did. And now Advanced Photography? I mean, wow. I'm-- Yeah. Good. No sugar. Don't take that to school, okay? Whole Foods. Whole Foods snacks. -Hey, Angela. -Dr. Johnson. What is it about us always leaving the building at the same time? -It's quitting time. -That's true. -You good? -Yeah, I'm good. Thanks. Good. Let me ask you something. Most married men have hobbies. Okay, Alan. Don't do this. Come on. -Don't do what? -We talked about this. It's not really fair for you to wait for me out here on the street. If you wanna make an appointment, we can make an appointment. Yeah, I know. But it's a little thing. Now, you remember the friend I was asking you about? The friend who has no friends? Other than you? Yeah, him. So he's a married guy, right? And he's got a great wife and the whole nine. But she will not let him-- I mean, it's like he can't just-- I mean, guys have guy hobbies, right? They play poker, they golf, they do shit. Okay, you know what? Stop. Stop. I can't treat you from the lobby to the car park. Treat me? I'm not-- I just asked you a question. -Well, whatever you wanna call it-- -No, you're right. -It's inappropriate. -You're right. I get it. Let me ask you one thing. I want your opinion as a woman, Angela. As a woman. Look, if I have this recurring dream where... ...I'm sitting on my couch... ...and it turns into a big vat of rubber, what is that? Why don't you let me refer you to someone else? Okay. Well... ...I hope it works out for you. You wait for me enough times out on the street, though... ...you might owe me some dental work. Have a nice day. Bingo. There we go. -That was a tough one. -Okay. Absolutely. Now it all will fall into place. Dad, can you take me to Becky Fishman's? Sweetie, it's 9:.30. She wants me to spend the night. Well, Daddy's had a long day at work... ...and he's finally finding some time to enjoy himself. Just have her come over here. And we can study your French together. Oh, you know what? I'll take her. I'll go. Babe. We've come this far. We've been working on this all week. I know. I'll go. I'll go, and then I'll just come right back. Don't be mad if I have this all done by the time you get back. Because I'm on a roll here. You're gonna miss out on all the action. Just make sure you save me some sky, okay? You know you owe that child bigtime. You would've thought she got you out of traffic school... ...by the look on your face. Good night, babe. -Good night. -Thanks. Hey, Charlie. Charlie. Charlie Fineman, hey! Charlie, stop! -Hey, Charlie. Hey, man. -Yeah? -It's Alan. -Hey. How are you? I saw you coming out of a paint store a couple weeks ago and.... I was screaming for you, honking the horn. I stopped the car, jumped out in traffic. It was crazy. Then I tried to get in touch with you, but nobody had any info on you. Oh, good, good. Very cool. -How you doing? -So we know each other? Are you kidding me? It's Alan Johnson, Charlie. We went to dental school together. Burrows Hall. I was your college roommate. You don't remember me? Yeah, very cool. Very cool. -Good. Good to see you, Burrows. -It's Johnson. Charlie, you seriously don't remember me? -We were college roommates? -Yeah. Yeah, you slept naked most nights. And you were a sleepwalker. It was the worst two years of my life. Hey, are you practising, man? I tried to get in touch through the Dental Guild-- I'm practising all the time, up in the valley. Took down of the Colossus so far. The valley? What is that? Is that a medical complex or something? It's more like another dimension. You take a journey and discover yourself. -Hey, man, you wanna go get a drink? -I can't drink. I can't drink. I can't drink. I can't drink. I gotta get going. Then a coffee or something. Let's just go get a cup of coffee. Real quick. I would just love to catch up with you, man. Hey, Charlie. This okay? You like trivia? Name the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes. Can you name them? Okay, Michigan is one. Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie and Superior. That was an easy one. That's fifth-grade shit. So, what have you been up to lately, Charlie? I'm stuck between Pale White and Moon White. I tried Butterscotch Yellow. I couldn't live with it. You painting something? You're remodelling or...? You were my college roommate. That was a long time ago. -A whole other life. -Oh, yeah. No shit. It's good to see your face. Johnson. Yeah, it's good to see you too, Charlie. Yeah. All right. You gotta take those shoes off. Thank you. Great record collection. Yeah. I'm happy with it. -A lot of vinyl. -Yeah. Over so far. It's a work in progress. Kitchen remodel? What is this? ""Shadows of the Colossus."" Can I use your bathroom, Charlie? Oh, in the back. Nice music room. Good? Okay. There you go, Allie. Thank you. I'm sorry about the way I behaved the last time I was here, doctor. But when I see you in the building, you always seem very busy. Preoccupied. Even when you're with the other doctors, you seem so solitary. So alone. I don't know why, but that seems very familiar to me. Yeah. Well. I hope you're-- I just thought that if you wanted me to... ...I would. With my mouth. I would. You could lock that door... ...tell the nurse not to come in. I'd do it. I'd enjoy making you happy. You have to leave. I have this odd sense of intimacy towards you. I don't even know why. I told my shrink, and she said I should act on it. Oh, she did? You need to get a new shrink. Get several. And get a new dentist too. You gotta get out of here, Miss Remar. I'm serious. I need you to leave right now. Please. Go. Okay. Come on. Okay. The fuck--? I need you not to reschedule Miss Remar for anything. Okay. Ever again. Nothing. Okay. I don't want this woman as a patient. -Got it. I got it. -Fine. Thank you. Excuse me! Not right now. Hey. Melanie, call her. -Miss Remar? -On the phone, I mean. Don't-- Miss Remar, you need to find another dentist. -Excuse me? -You heard me. Dr. Johnson don't want you as a patient... ...neither do any other doctors here... ...so go somewhere, bury your face in the phone book... ...and find another dentist, all right? -""Bury your face in the phone book""? -Yes. You have to be bold to make these kind of people go away. Thanks for holding. Can I help you? I'm just going up to see a friend of mine, Charlie Fineman. Nobody by that name lives here. Sorry. That's fine. I'll just wait for the landlord. That's me. Landlady. Adell Modell, landlady from hell. Oh, well, I'm Alan Johnson. I'm a friend of Charlie's. -Sure. -We went to dental school together-- I was in his apartment the other night. We were playing... ...""Shadows of the Colossus"" or something. You were up there in his apartment the other night? That's a load of crap. He hasn't had anybody up there in four years. Just me, Sugarman the accountant, the cleaning girl. He doesn't know about the cleaning girl. -I'm not lying to you. I was up there. -Yeah. He's remodelling his kitchen. Now, how would I know that? He's been remodelling that kitchen once every couple of months. That tells me nothing. Go away. Johnson. Johnson! -Yo. -Hey. Alan! Alan Johnson. This is my college roommate. It's my college roommate. I used to sleep in the nude. Check this out. I got a.... You'll appreciate this. The Pretenders. It's one of the great debut albums of all time. Yeah, that's you. Terrible taste in music. No, no, not true. Not true. Smell these things. I love the way they smell. Take a whiff. Brings back a feeling. Smells like the late '70s, don't it? -The early '80s. Yeah. -Charlie! Charlie! It's okay, Charlie. I'll take care of them. -Who's that? -Charlie, we just wanna talk. -We gotta go. We gotta go. -What? Why? Who is that? Johnson, hop on. Hop on, Johnson. -Hop on? -Get on. Get on. Johnson. -Who is that? -Johnson, damn it, get on. -Just get on the back. -Wait a minute! Charlie! Charlie! Bus, Charlie! Oh, shit! Charlie. I know, I know. All right. You're late. They're pissed. Name the one national U.S. monument that's movable. Suck my ass, retard. You're late. Get in there. No. San Francisco cable cars. Good. I didn't know that one either. That's a good one. That's a great one if you ever wanna stump somebody. If you guys could not laugh at anything I say, that'd really.... I'm trying to get my self-esteem to go to, like, seven percent. Could I get another Heineken? -You want another root beer? -I got enough. Thanks. Thanks. Hey, it was fun watching you up there tonight, man. It was good music. I don't know if I'd go that far. But you know what it reminded me of? It reminded me of school. When you used to jam to that Bruce Springsteen album. -What was the name of that album? -Bruce Springsteen.... Yeah. What was that? The River. -The River? -The River. You remember that? I was always trying to get you to play The O'Jays or Earth, Wind  Fire... ...but you always wanted to jam to The River. I don't remember jamming to it. Maybe if you smelled it, it'd all come rushing back. -This was fun, man. -Oh, yeah. I had a good day today. Riding around on that silly scooter. It was-- It was my first time doubles. -lt was fun. It was fun. -Yeah. I don't do anything like that. Lot of girls here, Charlie. That's gotta be half of the appeal, right? Why'd you ask me that? I don't know. I don't know. I'm just making small talk, you know? You're single now. You can do whatever you-- -What? -After what happened... -...with your family and everything-- -Whoa, hey, I don't have a family. No. No, I know. I was just trying to make small talk, but that was stupid. Who sent you here? -Did they send you here? -What are you talking about? -Are you a specialist? -A sp--? No, I'm not-- -What are you talking about? -Don't lie to me! Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me. -Charlie, calm down. -Why are you here? Why? Why? -Answer my fucking question. -Charlie, you're screaming. Why are you here right now talking to me? -Relax. Okay? -Why? Why? Shit! -The fuck is wrong with you? -Why are you talking to me? Oh, now I'm boring you? Mr. Heckler? I'm bored too. I'm sorry if I'm boring you. I'm sorry. You tell them to leave me alone! Alan. When you get a minute, we need to see you. Alan, this is bad. The woman sent us a letter, threatened to file a lawsuit. She claims that you sexually assaulted her in the office on several occasions. That is ridiculous, all right? That's absurd. Well, we checked with Melanie. Donna Remar. What do you know about her? This woman is insane. Okay? She came in, I put a single veneer on her... ...she tells me she's got this obsession-- Excuse me, Marie. She said she wants to give me oral sex in the office. You know what, you need to make this go away. We can't handle a hit like this on our insurance. Even if we win, we're gonna get killed. How do I do that? How do I make this go away? I don't know how you make it go away. You see her again, you discuss it.... Damn. I mean, isn't this exactly like what it was the last time? Woman falls for you, you lead them along-- -You know what, John? -No. No. What, Johnson? I'll get into it. Dr. Johnson? I need to speak with you. I'm Ginger Timpleman... ...and I'm Charlie Fineman's mother-in-law. -Did you know Charlie's family? -No. His parents died when he was in grade school. He lived with an aunt before college. I met her a couple of times. She passed just before the wedding. You know, my wife and l, we tried to call him so many times. Hadn't seen him in years, and I read about what happened in the paper... ...and I was just-- I was just heartbroken for him, you know? For them. He just, you know, shut down. Quit work. He stopped wanting to talk about her. Then he acted like he didn't remember them. Then he pretended he didn't remember us. Yeah. All my husband and l wanna do is see him. And that crazy landlady and his business manager, Sugarman... ...both conspire to keep us away. -Sugarman? -Yeah, I don't care for him. Who knows what that little shyster's taking from Charlie. -What is there to take? -Between the government payout... ...the insurance policy, Charlie has enough to take care of himself... ...put it that way. My husband retired young. He was a cop. You know, we were young. Young to be grandparents. I was gonna do nothing but travel... ...and spoil my granddaughters. Then those monsters flew over here from across the world... ...and rearranged my dance card. -Sorry. -Of course you are. But he needs help. Not the kind that landlady and some little accountant can give him. He needs a therapist. And he needs family. Guess what. Jonathan and l are the only family Charlie's got. Hey. Hey. Somebody's at the door. Somebody's at the door. Cherie. Cherie. -Get away from the door. -What are you doing? You don't go to the door in the middle of the night. You know that. I think it's Charlie Fineman. Is that Charlie? -Oh, yeah, that's him. -Okay. So let him in. Yeah? Were you in bed already? What's going on? It's 10:.30. I'm always in bed at 10:.30. -That sucks. That's grim. -You don't have any root beer on you... -...do you? -No, why? Alan. Charlie, this is my wife, Janeane. Hi, I believe we met about years ago in Central Park. -I don't expect you to remember it. -I don't. Okay. This is our daughter Cherie. Nice to meet you, Dr. Fineman. Go to bed, sweetheart. What's going on, Charlie? You wanna go out, man? Go have some fun? Let's hang out. -Right now? -Yeah, wake up. Come on. Let's-- -Can he go out? Is he allowed out? -Charlie, don't do that. Don't ask my wife permission for me to go out. I'm right here in front of you. I'm not years old. You're right. Can you go out? She's threatening to sue you? What does she want? She wants to go down on me. -Well, you tell her you can't do that. -No, I know. -You tell her you're married? -She knows. It's not a deterrent for this one. I mean, she's got some kind of a fixation or something. Oh, well, fix it for her. It's not funny, Charlie. -No, no, no. -It's really not funny, I mean.... -My partners are up my ass. -Right. We already pay an obscene amount in liability insurance. You should tell your partners they can do to you what the girl wants to do. Fuck them. I don't know. It's a five-year lease, grand a month... ...my name on it. My partners get pissed off... ...and they leave me holding the bag, that's it, I'm done. -Yeah. -I put the whole thing together. They act like I'm the one who works for them. But the girl, what are you gonna do about that? That's weird, you know? It's kind of heavy. Yeah, it is. I'm telling you, this girl's seriously troubled. Oh, yeah. She got a lot of problems if she wants to blow you. She's out of her mind. I've seen that thing. -That's very funny. -No, no, no. No, it is-- Are you having fun? To tell you the truth, I kind of am, Johnson. It's nice to see you in the soup like this. It's funny. Just not used to it. -Here. Take it easy. Take it easy. -Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Any chance of you getting audited this week? Because that would make things even better. Or maybe we could go somewhere... ...and you could burn your tongue on some pizza. I'd like that too. I would love that. I need you to hold for one moment. You are not gonna believe who this is on the phone. -Who? -The nut. At this point in my life, you're gonna have to be very specific. Donna Remar. She wants to come in for another consultation for some more veneers. Can you believe that? Ma'am? -Ma'am? -Schedule it. -Excuse me? -Schedule it in my office alone. -Morning, Oscar. -Hey, doc. Good to see you. -Hello, Dr. Johnson. -Hello. -I've got a question. -I'm sure you do. -No, it's not about me this time. -How refreshing. It's about a friend. Really, though. I mean, really, a real friend. He lost his whole family in a plane crash. -Right. -It's horrible. I mean, his wife, his three daughters. This guy used to be a dentist. -How long ago? -It's a few years ago... ...and he's lost now. You know? He's completely lost. I bumped into him. We used to be college roommates for two years. -He didn't even remember me. -Well, offhand, that sounds like... ...post-traumatic stress disorder. Maybe worse. I couldn't really know without seeing him. It sounds like he needs help. -ls he getting help? -I don't know. I mean, the whole thing is.... It's really odd, you know? It's crazy odd. How are you? I'm fine. I got nothing to complain about. Does that mean you're fine? Very good. You are gonna be sending me a bill one day. You might wanna check your mailbox. -Okay. -Dr. Johnson, I think it would be... ...really good for you to talk to someone. I just sense that it would be... ...good for you to be a little bit more communicative. I hope that didn't offend you. Okay. Well, I'll see you soon? Okay. -Charlie. -ln the back! -Hope the shoes are off. -Shoes are off. Shoes are off. Hey, the kitchen's looking good, man. You almost done? Is that The River? Yeah. You know, I gotta get you enrolled in a music-appreciation class. Oh, right, yeah. Tell that to Clarence Clemons. What's going on? What's going on with the girl? The crazy girl, the one who wants your penis. How's she doing? -Let's not talk about her. -Yeah, you wanna--? Lose that tie. Lose the tie and the scarf. The whole outfit. -For what? -Come on, take it off. Psychedelic time. Psychedelic time. I smell a Fineman jam session coming on. Yeah, Burrows Hall-style. Burrows Hall. Jamming and jamming and jamming. -Here. -I don't play guitar, Charlie. Hey, Johnson, you're barely a dentist. You pull people's teeth all day. It don't matter. Come on. Come on. All right. Get that in you. Get that in you. -Let me do this. -You'll get to this. Come on. Let me hear some of that. I don't know how to play this. Charlie Fineman! -Alan Johnson. Alan Johnson! -Charlie Fineman! Good night, Jersey! -Philadelphia. Philadelphia! -Good night, Philly! Baby, I'm sorry. I messed up, but you know I don't ever do anything like that. I just didn't wanna call you and wake you up. I was stuck in Charlie world. I couldn't... ...Ieave. This is not okay. You staying out all night... ...it's not acceptable. I'm just saying, the guy's in a lot of pain. It's sad over there, baby. It's just-- Just a sea of sadness. -Yeah. -Hi. Charlie Fineman for Dr. Johnson. -You don't have an appointment, sir? -Oh, we're friends. -What--? -We were college roommates. -And? -I used to sleep in the nude. -Charlie? -All right, come in. I hear ""Colossus."" Hey. Hey, hey, buddy. Take the shoes off. I told you. I told you. Hey, didn't you just...? All right. All right. Hey, let me try it. Hang on. -Let me try it. -Just watch me do it first. Let me just try it. -Okay, how do you shoot it? -Square is to stab him. That's the bird. You wanna shoot him, get his attention. All right. All right, get your arrow ready. And let me pluck him right in the uterus. Aim what? Oh, fuck. I could show you how to do it, give you some hints... ...but I'll warn you, it's very addictive. Well, I don't have an addictive personality... ...so just show me how to do it. Is something I said funny? All right. That'll call your horse. The triangle is how you jump.... Okay, okay, very good. -Stab his arm. -I'm stabbing him in the arm. -No, you gotta stab in the right spot. -I'm stabbing it right there. You gotta be on the light. -Shit. -That's not gonna work. I gotta climb this big son of a bitch-- Look, just put it down, all right? Rest. Next time you come, you'll be better. Let it soak in. No, no, no. Right now. No next. Now. I thought you don't have an addictive personality. That was the line of the night, man. You're an addict. -Say it, man. Say you're an addict. -Yeah, okay. I'm an addict. All right. -Come on, now, stab his wing. -Oh, God. -Oh, I'm on your ass, bird. -Stab his wing. All right. Yeah. Colossus! That's the first three.... Okay, now, wait. You said they get bigger too? Well, no, it's different. It's like you're gonna use a bow and arrow more. -Each one will have different powers. -What are we doing? Wait a minute, Charlie, you said get a burger, man. I can't-- I can't do this. I gotta work in the morning. Yeah, so you'll work, you'll be tired. So what? This is like a marathon, man. It'll go till in the morning. I can't-- You'll go to sleep tomorrow night at 8:.00 instead of 10:.30. How's that? Is that enough sleep, you faggot? Hey, don't call me faggot. -Are you a faggot? -Quit saying faggot. Just don't say faggot. Don't just call people faggot. That's rude. To a gay guy it is. To you, it's just... ...a funny word, like pound cake or pickle. You're a fucked-up dude, man. I'm a fucked-up dude? Okay. You really need some Mel. You need some Mel. I'll take one adult and one faggot. Come on, you really need to come in here. Johnson. -Johnson. -Okay. Good decision. Hey! The sheriff is a nig-- -What did he say? -The sheriff is near. No. The sheriff is a nig-- I ain't got no body And nobody cares for me He's out of his mind. -Richard Pryor, he did his own thing. -They both did great, obviously... ...but I can only imagine, if they would have done another one? Janeane's called times. -Hello? -Hey, baby. Where have you been? I've been calling you for the last three hours. I know. I'm sorry. I had the phone off. I was in this Mel Brooks marathon. I've never laughed so hard. I gotta bring you down here. -This thing is crazy. -Alan, I need you to listen to me. Your father's died. -What? -And I've been trying to reach you-- -What did you just say? -Your mother called here... ...a couple hours after you left. He died in his sleep, in his bed... ...and Mom's here with us now and she's very upset and she needs you. Wait a minute, wait a minute. He's dead? I'm sorry, baby. -Where are the girls? -They're with Mom on the couch. They're fine. -I'll be home as soon as I can. -Will you please hurry up? Yeah, I will. Everything cool? My dad just died. Died, like... -...dead? -Yeah. You wanna go get some breakfast? Charlie, my father just died. Yeah. There's a store that's gonna open up soon. Sells kitchen counters. I wanna take you there. -They got marble tops. -Charlie, my father just died. Yeah, yeah, I know. I wanna hang, though. Come on. Let's not waste all this Mel. We just got a good dose of Mel. Are we hanging? No. We're not hanging. Oh, hey, let's get some Chinese. Come on, don't be such a pussy. All right, does everybody see what it is? Here it is. At the bottom. See? Good look. Come on. What do you think? -Yeah. -Johnson? -Yep. -I'm Sugarman. Bryan Sugarman? Did I catch you at a bad time? Well, I just came back from burying my father, but other than that-- Cool. Let me just say up front, Alan... ...I make it my business to watch this guy's back. -That's what I do. I look out for him. -Okay. Now, obviously, I can't stop him from doing this... ...without going down a very dangerous legal road. But rest assured, I'll do anything short of that... ...to not give you a million dollars. I don't know what you're talking about. He wants me to give you a million dollars. He has that kind of money? That's none of your business. That's my business. It's what I do. We've already established that. I won't let him be manipulated. Sugarman, calm down, okay? I don't want his million dollars. Tell him I'm not mad at him and we're still friends, okay? Just tell him that. -You're being straight? -Yes. I don't need his million dollars, okay? Just tell him that. Okay. I like that. Okay, good, then I've done my job. Yeah. Good job. Come on in and have some food. Go ahead. Daddy, your friend is here. The one who acts like he's younger than JoJo. Charlie Fineman? Honey, don't be like that, okay? Don't judge people. That's not polite. Hey. I'm sorry about your dad. Thanks. I behaved badly that night. I know I did. All right? I'm sorry. And you wanted to give me a million dollars to make up for it? I don't have any friends other than you, Johnson. I got you something. -The River. -Absolutely. -And Quadrophenia. -Yeah. Another album you used to torture me with. Quadrophenia changed my life, Johnson. That's a nice gift. Too late to go for the million? -Hey, are you hungry? -Yeah. -Wanna get some breakfast? -Yeah. -Come on. -All right. Just me and you here? Hey, everybody... ...this is Charlie. Charlie... ...this is everybody. Come on in. These guys are staying? Yeah, Charlie. Everybody's staying. Charlie Fineman for Dr. Johnson. We're having lunch today. We're having Chinese. I can't tell you how happy that makes me. The last time you were in a dental office, anyway? Need to schedule you for a cleaning? Come on. Let's go get something to eat. You miss it? Miss what? -Nothing. Forget it. -What? What? Come on. Charlie, nothing, all right? Forget it. No, what do you think I missed, being a dentist? Do you? Why? -Why what? -Why are you asking me? Are you trying to focus me? Is that it? Did they send you here to focus me? Yeah, you got me. That's it. I'm with the ClA... ...and this is Operation Focus Fineman. -Are you kidding me? -Better not be. Charlie, if we're gonna be friends, you have to be able to trust me. -Thought we were friends. -We are friends. That's why I can't pretend I don't know anything about you. Is that a threat, though, to not be friends? No. I'm saying friends talk about what's going on in their lives. You're an asshole. Charlie-- Hey, Charlie! What the fuck is wrong with you? Get out of here, man! Charlie, get the f-- Okay, okay. Get out of here. Get out of here. Leave me alone! All right? Charlie, get out of here! Yeah. All right. Shut your mouth. What are you still doing in here? I told you to leave. Because this isn't your office. I left! This is public property. -This isn't close to public property. -Yes, it is! -Get out of here, man! -I'll call the police if you don't leave. -It's okay. Let me handle it. -No, it's not! He's-- Melanie, shut the damn window! Jesus. We can't keep doing this shit, Charlie. Look, I don't know what I said to you in there that got you so pissed off... ...but I'm sorry, Charlie, all right? All right. -Jesus. -I know. -Dr. Johnson. -Miss Remar. -ls everything okay? -Oh, yeah. Everything's good. -I have an appointment scheduled. -Just check in with Melanie. -Maybe I should come back. -No, no, it's fine. Just check in. Check in with Melanie. The one who--? Doctor will see you in the office. That gorgeous girl wants to blow you? -Charlie, come on. -She wants to blow you? -Look, get out-- -Come here. Are you crazy? Get out of here. -She's gorgeous. -Yeah, I know. Way you were talking about-- Thought she was a beast or something. -I gotta straighten this out. -All right, but how hot is that girl? -She's fine. She's hot. -She's the hottest. -ls she not the hottest? -Charlie, will you get out--? Let me go in for you. Let me get the blowjob. -Let me see that woman. -Oh, you're playful now? Get out. Stop it! Get out of here! Did you smell that? She even smells good! Jesus. -I wanna know what is going on. -Nothing is going on. -Don't tell me nothing's going on. -Calm down. -Let me explain it, okay? -All right, explain it. She's like out of a 1940s movie. Did you see that girl? I mean, that was just perfection. You okay? ""Okay""? No, I wouldn't use that word. Well, thank you for seeing me. Did I have a choice, Miss Remar? I mean.... You've really put me in a terrible position here at my office. Can we just cut to it? I don't wanna take a lot of your time. Yeah. This letter... ...that you sent my-- I can do this quick. Wait a-- No, no. Please. Recently, I've come through a rotten divorce. I was married for years. My husband was having an affair for five of them. They had another life here in the city. He had two lives. I was walking down the street one day and I saw them. And I followed them, and it was truly like a dream. I spoke to a neighbour and she talked about them... ...as if they were the Joneses living next door all these years. And in that moment, I lost my equilibrium. And I fell, right there on the sidewalk. And the thing is, Dr. Johnson, I haven't yet gotten up. Now, my behaviour towards you is inexcusable, I know that. I behaved in a way I don't normally behave. What I've done by even threatening a lawsuit is so repulsive to me. I even lied to you when I told you that my therapist... ...had told me to act on my thoughts. I wanted to come in and see you and tell you that I am so sorry. And that I am very embarrassed. And that you won't be having any more trouble from me. -I promise that to you. -Okay. Okay. -Okay. Well, I'll go now. -Yeah. I'll leave. Elizabeth, can I get a cup of coffee? Sure. Dr. Johnson, do you want anything? No, he's fine. Me? Get him to talk? No way. That's not what I do. Well, he needs to talk to somebody. He's in trouble. He needs to see somebody. He's got you. He's got a friend. That's big. That's a major step. No, he needs more help than I can give him. What, are you gonna save him now? Is that what this is all about? I was his best friend. His golfing and his fishing buddy, okay? -Our families vacationed together. -Okay. On September 12th, 2001, that was over. He wants nothing to do with me. Nothing to do with my wife. He likes you, Alan. You know why? -Why? -It's very simple. Because you know nothing about Doreen and Jenny and Julie and Gina. Or Spider, the family poodle. You know nothing about them, so he figures you won't ask questions. He figures you'll just let him be. Now, how funny is this? That you're up here wanting me to help out in another... ...fruitless campaign to get Charlie to see a shrink. The one guy he figures would just let him be. -Hey. -Hey. I think I'm gonna get him some help. Charlie. Did he ask you for help? Well, he needs help. He's gotta get back in the game. He's gotta get his life back. The people around him right now, they're just enabling him. Are you sure that's a good idea? I mean, what do the experts say? I don't know. I'll find out. I know he needs help. You think you have time for all this? I mean, with work and your mom and-- I know you don't think so, but I'm trying to help him. Trying to help my friend. Okay. -Want some breakfast? -Yeah. Thank you. Just glad you wanted to do this just out of nowhere. You know, I think it's about time you get your head around what is... ...and what isn't good music. Oh, right, right, right. Oh, Graham Nash. Songs For Beginners. Just the album cover alone. Look at that face. He knows he made a great record. Oh, okay, wait. Right here. Okay. We got O'Jays. We got-- What else we got? The Soul Tr-- Hey. From the Funk Side. Now, what record collection's complete without this? I'll put that on my list. Hey, Alan. -Oh, hey, Nigel. -Hey. -How are you? -Good. What are you doing here? Oh, I'm just sort of rummaging. I'm a vinyl hound. I love this stuff. Yeah. Hey, Charlie, this is a good friend of mine, Nigel. Nigel, Charlie Fineman. Charlie Fineman, Nigel. Billy Joel, Cold Spring Harbor. They recorded this at too high of a speed, so it was unreleasable. Eventually it came out, though. He grew up two towns away from where I grew up. We used to go to the same White Castle. Say, do you guys wanna get some lunch after this? Yeah. What do you think, Charlie? I just wanna stay here. Well, afterwards. I just thought, you know... ...Iet's go get some lunch with Nigel. Can I talk to you? I don't wanna eat with that guy. He's a dork. I mean, look at him, he's a giant dork. Looks like a lump of shit that someone left on the sidewalk. -Charlie, come on. -Admit it. He's a dork. Tell me he's not a dork. Charlie, I'm pretty sure he can hear you. So, what do you do, Charlie? I'm a collector. Really? What do you collect? What do I collect? I don't know. Johnson, you can answer for me. What do I collect? Charlie collects things from his life. You know, things that he finds germane to his lifestyle. And how would you describe your lifestyle, Charlie? I noticed in the record store, you were holding up a Bob Seger album. Are you a Seger man, Nigel? Love Seger, yes. Yeah. Smokin' O.P. 's, Mongrel. When'd you get into him? Probably later. Silver Bullet or Seger System? Well, actually, I don't like either of those albums. That's funny, because they're not albums. Those are his bands. Seger's an artist. A genius. An American original. And what are you, Nigel? A therapist? Is that it? You sizing me up? You on the case now? You gonna fix me? No, look, I was out for a nice afternoon, I ran into my old friend-- Oh, bullshit. You stink like a shrink. You got shrink hands. -You ordered your salad like a shrink. -Okay. -Let's stop. This was my mistake. -No, this is good. -How does a shrink order a salad? -Don't, Nigel. -ln your opinion. I'd like to know. -Let's go outside. I'm gonna beat your ass. I will beat your ass, shrink-wrap. Seger fan. You'd get your ass kicked at a fucking Seger concert. -Charlie. -Get the fuck up! Get up! I made you in the record store the minute I saw your dorky face. Outside! Okay, Charlie, calm down. You liar. Hey. Hey. The girls still at gymnastics? Yep. I'm gonna go wash up. I made dinner. Where were you, at Charlie's? You know what the whole problem is? This whole Charlie problem? You're jealous of him. -Really? -Yeah, really. I have a friend, I'm spending time away from the house... ...and it's got your feathers ruffled. You are jealous of Charlie. I actually think you're jealous of Charlie. He's caught up in this world of pain, thick like quicksand... ...and your only response is to covet his freedom. That is sick, Janeane. -ls it? -What, I'm jealous of that? Just because the guy can, what, do whatever he wants now... ...and he's got the freedom to just-- I mean, you think I'm jealous of that? I covet that? You need to check yourself. That is-- That's sick. What happened to that woman? The one that wanted to go down on you? I talked to Melanie at the office, and she said you made it go away. -Wait a minute. You called Melanie? -Yes, I did. So you're checking up on me now, Janeane? Alan, I gotta talk to somebody, because you're not talking to me. -She's right. I made it go away. -I'd like to know how you did that. I invited the woman in, I shut the door... ...I hopped on the desk and I just let her do it. That's real mature, Alan. Well, listen to what you're saying to me. What are you insinuating? You don't know me better than that? I'm gonna go take a walk. Say hi to Charlie. Don't do that. Don't. Don't act like you know what I'm-- Did I say I was going to Charlie's? Don't do that. You're not in my head. Send him my love. See? You want-- And if l-- Then.... Okay. Okay. Charlie Fineman to see Dr. Johnson. -Did you wanna talk, Charlie? -I'll wait. It's private. Oh, well, you can speak freely. I mean, this one's totally knocked out. She's a thousand miles away. And Anna's from Guatemala. She just got to this country recently. She doesn't even speak English. Anna, Charlie's a superhero from outer space... ...and he stuffs the front of his tights with a sock. You are very nice. See? Privacy. I was thinking about it, and you were right. I do need to get some help. -I wanna get help. -That's great. Yeah. I just-- I gotta be really careful, though, I don't-- I just know I'm better off not having certain thoughts. You're doing the right thing... ...because you need help to process those thoughts. Well, I don't want it to be that bozo Nigel. -No. -He's a dork. He's the biggest dork I've ever seen. -Yeah, I get it. -All right. I get it. That was seriously fucked up, Alan. I didn't know he was gonna say all that shit. Angela? -Hi. -Hey. -How you doing? -Good, thank you. You? -Good. Good to see you. -Nice to see you. Charlie, this is Angela. Angela, this is Charlie. He's my college roommate. Nice to meet you, Charlie. Well, thanks for seeing us on such short notice. Why don't you guys come in and make yourselves comfortable? I was just gonna grab a coffee. Anyone? No, I'm good. Charlie? Are you kidding me? She's a baby. Listen, you're right. She's young. But she's good. A lot of experience with loss and grief counselling. She's got nice tits. That's not good. Since when? Good point. We'll do the meet-and-greet, you'll see what you think... ...if you like her, we go from there. -Am I wrong about her tits? -No, you're right. They're wonderful. So, what are you guys talking about? What's so wonderful? Well, think about it, Charlie... ...and call me or have Alan call me and we'll schedule something. -Donna, hi. -I'm early. -Yeah. -Dr. Johnson. How are you? -I'm fine. -I'm early. Okay. Oh, Donna, this is Charlie. You remember Donna, right? She's early. -Hi. -We were just wrapping up. -Are you a patient of Angela's? -I didn't agree to that yet. But you are. And it's because you're her.... And you two are.... -Yes. -We should get started. -And we have a session now, so-- -Let's get going. We should get started. I'm sorry about the overlap. Charlie, nice to meet you. Alan, thank you. Better bring out the big guns for this one. She's crazy with a side of crazy. -Bye. -Just saying. Protect yourself. -You okay? -Yeah. Just make sure they never schedule me near that girl, all right? I would-- No, it's just, I never wanna see her again. That's trouble. She's too good-looking, I just-- Nobody has a right to look that good. It's trouble for everybody. Okay, Charlie. So have you thought at all about what you'd like to talk about today? And how you wanna start this? Not really. I don't know. I'm good. You're good? I'm okay. That's good. What makes you okay? I don't know. Can I just say something? You're too young. You're a baby. I can't do this. What can I do to help you, Charlie? How can someone like me help you? I have these things... ...that I don't like to think about. You're too young. You're too young. I can't do this. I gotta put these back on. That's okay. So how are you, Charlie? How was your week? It was good. Except I was angry. -I was pretty mad. -Who were you mad at? I was mad at you. -I didn't really wanna come back here. -Why didn't you wanna come back? Well, you know why. Every week, you try to make me do it again. What do I try to make you do, Charlie? Talk about things I don't wanna talk about. Well, for the last few weeks, you've been saying you were getting ready... -...to talk about some of those-- -No, goddamn it, that was you! I didn't say that, you did! I don't wanna talk about those things. I don't remember. I'm sorry. I'm glad you came in, even though you were mad at me. Yeah. I am too. Can I say something, Charlie? -Yeah. -lt might make you mad again. No. Go. There is no point in you coming here every week... ...if we eventually don't discuss your life... ...and discuss your family. Is this session over yet? No, it just started. Can it be? If you want it to be, yes. Charlie, before you go, I'd just-- I'd like to say something. Look, the fact is you had a family... ...and you suffered a great loss... ...and until you can discuss that and we can really talk about that... ...this is all just an exercise. I can be patient, Charlie... ...but you need to tell someone your story. It doesn't have to be me, but someone. Charlie, wait a second. You didn't tell me that this guy's partner was black. I mean, that makes this almost bearable. Why do they gotta give him the green V plunge--? I mean, that's-- Why'd they do that? That's kind of faggoty. I had three daughters. -I know. -Gina was 5. She was.... Jenny... ...was 7. She.... She liked boys already. Julie was 9. She was older. They all looked alike, Johnson. Like Doreen. Doreen was my wife. D.T. That was her nickname. Doreen Timpleman. She had a dog, Spider. Spider. A poodle. They'd wake me up all the time, Saturday mornings, you know... ...singing Beatles songs to me, in harmony. The four of them. So cute. So cute. Doreen never, never judged me. You know? Never nagged, like some wives do. She just wanted me to take my shoes off... ...so I didn't wreck the carpet. That's it. Doreen and the girls were very female. I was the oddball, you know? Mr. Man. They adored me, Johnson. I bet they did. I know they did, Charlie. They had long brown hair... ...except little Gina. She kept her hair short, you know. To be different from everybody. She.... She had a birthmark too. Looked like a burn... ...but it wasn't. When she was little, they said it was gonna go away... ...but it never did. Jenny. Jenny, this one... ...she wanted to be a gymnast. She was such a klutz, though. I didn't have the heart to mention it as a problem. They went to see... ...Doreen's sister, Ellen, and her girls in Boston... ...and they took Spider because... ...I had to work and they didn't trust me to feed her. But that was a joke, right? And then... ...we were all going to D.T.'s little cousin's wedding... ...in Los Angeles, and I was gonna meet them out there. The kids wanted to go to Disneyland... ...but they had-- They were already gonna miss a couple days of school... ...so we had to say no. You know. So I'm going on out to meet them in Los Angeles. And on my way to JFK, I'm in the taxicab... ...and I hear on the radio.... I get there and some man tells me the plane's from Boston. Some other guy says there's two planes. Then I go inside the airport and I'm watching-- I'm watching on the television and l-- And I saw it. I saw it and I felt it at the same time. I thought about Gina's birthmark... ...and l-- I felt them burning. Can we go? I wanna go home now. I don't like this. I don't like doing it. Remembering. I don't like remembering. New York One has gotten evidence of a credible terror threat... ...and New York City may be a target. As a result, the terror-alert status has been raised. City officials are beefing up security on our subways, buses and airports. Specifics about the threat haven't been released. Cops won't confirm whether there's a link to the al Qaeda terror group.... For Americans and Iraqis alike... ... today's violent demonstrations... ... were just another long chapter in the ongoing war on terror. In Baghdad, a cop-- Charlie? Charlie, are you here? Lincoln next door called to say that you were listening to the TV too loud. I said you didn't listen to the TV, but-- Are you okay? Charlie. Charlie. What's wrong with you? -What are you doing, man? -You fucking almost hit me. -What are you, drunk? -Are you drunk? You almost hit me. Get out of the way before I run you over. You run me over? Come on. Come run me over. Come and run me over! Look out! Get out of the way! Okay, friend, drop the gun! N.Y.P.D.! Drop the gun now! N.Y.P.D.! Drop the gun! Andrew, where are you, man? -This guy's crazy! -It's good. -Andrew! -Just do it. Come on, do it. -Andrew, where are you? -Do it. -I'm gonna toast him, Andrew! -Do it. -Get him the fuck down! -Do not move a muscle. Don't ever point a gun at me again. I should've fucking shot you. -Get up. Get up. -Get up on your feet now! -Against the wall. -Up against the wall. Get the fuck up, you bastard! What the fuck you think this is? Stay the fuck up! Get the fuck up! Alan, say hi to Pete Savarino, Charlie's attorney. This is Alan Johnson. All the criminal charges are gonna be dropped. -That's good. -The city doesn't wanna make... ...a big case out of this. A 91 widower gets beat up by the cops. Doesn't look good. So we're gonna go a different way. They wanna do a three-day psych evaluation at Roosevelt Hospital. That's standard procedure. Well, it's better than jail, I guess, but Jesus-- Here you go. Here, talk to him and I'll get the paperwork done. Okay. You okay? What's gonna happen? Well, they wanna hold on to you... ...for a few days and do a psych evaluation, you know. Angela and l, we're gonna-- -We're gonna follow you and-- -Okay. I'll get you settled in, make sure everything's all right. I'm really sorry, Charlie. I feel like this is my fault. You know, like I pushed you too hard. I just wanted you to... ...be better or something, I don't know. I'm sorry. When you feel uncomfortable, you let me know, all right? -Are you calm? -I'm good. But something that you are not doing has brought him here to this point. That's completely irrelevant. I will see to it that he has proper out-post treatment... ...and I will take care of him. Please don't tell me how to do my job. I understand what is needed here. I'm not wanting him to.... Sign out. -Where's he going? -I don't know. Listen, Charlie, there's gonna be a-- A hearing Friday morning. The DA's office wants you back in here. They wanna have you committed. They wanna have the right to hold on to you for up to a year. That's what they're saying. The hospital staff is recommending it as well... ...and the Timplemans, they're onboard with it too. The Timplemans? Can we go get Chinese now? You know what it is? Janeane and l are just up under each other too much. She's always asking me to open up, you know... ...talk to her, and then I do... ...and everything gets so personal, and the whole thing just goes to shit. Yeah. Says she wants to hear what I have to say. She doesn't wanna hear it. -Well, what do you have to say? -That I need some air. You know? I mean, I love her. I'm still in love with her. But, come on, give me some air, man. I mean, it's like I'm not even me anymore. You know? I'm not some damn Siamese twin, I'm me. And that shouldn't piss her off. It's just-- It shouldn't. You wanna know what I remember about you from college? Nobody ever gave you any shit. You didn't take shit from anybody. You know what else? I hate what I do. You know, the money's good. But I swear to God, I hate putting phoney teeth on phoney people. But don't get me wrong. I'm a dentist, and when people need it, that's great. I feel for them. But some assholes... ...I just wanna slap them in the head and say:. ""Get your ass out on the street."" You know? ""There's a lot worse things to worry about than your teeth."" So, what's going on with this... ...kitchen-remodelling thing? What's up with that? What else could you do besides veneers? No, no. Don't change the subject. What's going on with that? Come on, tell me. What's up with the kitchen thing? Tell me. The last time I spoke to Doreen... ...she was at the airport in Boston. She wanted-- Wanted to talk to me... ...about the kitchen remodel... ...that she and the girls wanted to do. And I was busy, running out the door... ...and I fucking snapped at her. Oh, man, the last time I fucking spoke to her. I hated kitchen talk. I think you gotta let that go, Charlie. I'm sure you said a lot of nice shit to her before then, man. It's one thing, man. Just let it go. -Yeah? -Hell, yeah. Are you gonna be all right, Charlie? You're gonna make it, right? I'm more worried about you, Johnson. I'm more worried about you. If you listen carefully, you'll be able to hear assholes puckering, okay? Go, go, go. Hello. Listen up. If I ever happen to get into a situation with a patient again... ...I don't care what it does to our liability... ...you know what you're gonna do? You're gonna back me up. I put this practise together... ...and I made you all filthy stinking rich. Especially you, Stelter. Got a problem with what I'm saying, take your ass back to Brooklyn... ...and get whacked around with insurance cases. That's it. I'm sick of playing with candy-asses. You know, Alan, I really think this is inappropriate. I don't care what you think. This isn't a discussion. It's a warning. There's gonna be some changes made around here... ...and you may not all make the cut. As you were. The new champ. No, no. You were in there with me. It's what you said. See, that's the old college Johnson. That's taking-no-shit Johnson. I gotta.... Unfortunately, I think I was thinking about another guy we know. Handleman, Andrew Handleman. -He didn't take shit from nobody. -Oh, yeah. You used to take shit from everybody, though. Remember that? But you were great in this one. That was fun. What were the combined findings of the hospital staff? The staff did find Charles Fineman victim to severe symptoms... ...of post-traumatic stress disorder... ...as well as delusional tendencies related to that... ...and an incapability to function... ...in anything resembling a normal adult manner. And do you think remanding him to the hospital for up to a year... ...would benefit Dr. Fineman? Yes, I do. -Thank you. -Thank you, Dr. Bale. You may step down. I disagree strongly with that finding. Your Honour, I think that Charlie needs to find his own way. Not on our time, but on Charlie's time. And I think that will happen. He'll find people that will fill his life again. Not today, but soon. Slowly. Can I just ask a question... ...about your life experience in regard to this long-term illness? I'm curious. How old are you? What does that have to do with anything? -Dr. Fineman-- -That question sucks, Your Honour. -It's actually a good question. -No, no, no, it sucks. It sucks. You know, we're gonna talk about age. He's gotta go to Little League practise soon. Dr. Fineman. Mr. Fallon, the question's specious. It demeans the court. You don't need to address it, Dr. Oakhurst. He wouldn't talk about them from that day on, any of them. Then he cut us off. He wouldn't take my calls. He wouldn't take our calls. You know, this has destroyed my wife a second time... ...what's happening here with Charlie. She couldn't even take the stand today. This has been awfully hard on her. Tell me about what happened the last time Charlie was over. We wanted to show him some pictures of the girls, some photos. It was very, very hard. We wanted to give them to him. And what happened when you showed him the photos? Charlie broke a beautiful lamp of Ginger's. It was one of a set. We gave the other to our daughter. It was-- How long are we gonna talk about this lamp? Goddamn it. It was a lamp. Let it go already. -It's more than a lamp, Charlie. -Oh, come on. It was a hell of a lot more than a lamp. -Just stop it already. Just stop it. -Okay, okay. Enough. That's one. Both of you... ...that's one. Mrs. Timpleman, sit down. He knows damn well what that fricking lamp meant to me. Sit down. Go on. Do you carry any pictures of your grandchildren, Jonathan? In my wallet, yes, of course I do. Of course he does. What is he, an animal? Oh, ma'am, please stop. Are these photographs copies... ...of the same photographs that you carry with you every day? Yes. And what was this little angel's name? This is Gina. She was 5. She was a little doll. And this is little Jenny. She was quite a little chess player. She got that from me. Jenny wanted to join a tournament, so I signed her up and we went. And that photograph... ...that's you and her at a chess tournament together? Yes. -And this? -This is all of us at the Cape. And this photograph. -This is your daughter Doreen here? -Yes. And this photograph... ...this is all four of them? Yes. All four of them. Dr. Fineman. Dr. Fineman. That's two. I bet you miss them. I think about them all day. Every day of my life. I don't understand how anyone could not. Dr. Fineman. I have no further questions, Your Honour. -Your Honour, you gonna allow this? -That's three. Bailiff. Take him out to the hallway. Just let the guy-- -Wait a minute. Wait a minute. -Hey, come on. Hey, take it easy. Take it easy with him. I'm right here, Charlie. Charlie, I'm right here. Charlie, I'm right here. Clear the court. I wanna see counsel for both sides and the Timplemans... ...in my chambers in minutes. This is a mess. First off, you ever pull crap like that in my court again... ...I will have hardened inmates using you as a dress-up doll. -Hear me? -Your Honour, in my defence-- Quiet. You know something? The more I think about this damn case... ...the more I realise that this is a family matter. This is not something that the state should be deciding upon. -Your Honour-- -Shut up. I'm serious. I want you to shut up, Mr. Fallon. This is not going well for you, you hear me? Shut up. Yes. Shut up. Mr. and Mrs. Timpleman... ...this is very serious stuff we're talking about here. I mean, it's easy to see... ...that this man is going through something very profound. It's obvious. He may need some hospitalisation. He may. On the other hand... ...he might just need to find his own way. The fact is... ...you're correct. You are the closest thing he has to family. -Thank you. -Yes, of course. I want you to go home... ...and think very hard this weekend. Because we're all gonna meet back here on Monday morning... ...and I'm going to let the two of you decide. I want you to rack your brains. I want you to think about what your little girl would have you do... ...in this situation. And I'm gonna have you look me straight in the eye... ...on Monday morning... ...and tell me whether or not... ...she would want her man put away in a place like that. You understand what it is that I am telling you, Mrs. Timpleman? The power that I am putting in your hands. Yes. Yes, sir. Your Honour, can I just say something? Let me-- What is his name? Bryan Sugarman. Bryan Sugarman. Monday morning. Ten-thirty. Don't bring Sugarman. Is Dr. Johnson coming out? He's inside with the judge. Can I sit down? Charlie, can Donna sit down? She really wanted to come to your hearing today to support you. -Here? -Yeah. -Yeah. -Yeah. On your side. She can sit on your side, though. All right? I don't know how they can't see that he's just got a broken heart. It's so broken, his poor heart. It's okay. I don't need to talk about her or look at pictures... ...because the truth is, a lot of times, I see her... ...on the street. I walk down the street, I see her in someone else's face... ...clearer than any of the pictures you carry with you. I get that you're in pain. But you got each other. You got each other... ...and I'm the one who's gotta see her and the girls all the time. Everywhere I go. I even see the dog. That's how fucked up I still am. I look at a German shepherd, I see our goddamn poodle. All right. All right. What is this? He's gone. The movers finished up an hour ago. Didn't even leave a forwarding. He just left this. He said that this was to be for you, Ginger. Listen, I know you've both been through hell... ...but shouldn't you just leave him alone? We just wanna be part of his life. No, I know. I understand, but it's not an option right now. Monday morning, you need to go in there... ...and just call off the dogs. Okay. You take care, Adell. Thank you for taking care of Charlie. Thanks. -When did he redo the kitchen? -Oh, God, the kitchen. Sixteen thousand times he did the kitchen. It's beautiful. The girls would love the colour. They would love this look. It's a kitchen, sweetie. Come on. Can you sign off for me? -Hey. -Thanks. This is the last of it. I got a pizza coming. Could you just send it up? Yeah, yeah, we'll send it up. You're up. Wanna go? No, no, no. I gotta... ...get back to your spot and get my car. I'll come and hang out with you tomorrow for lunch. -Hi. -Hi. Come on in. -Anyone order pizza? -This is the place. Here, I'll take it. Come on in. Come on in. -I'm gonna go. -Yeah, I think it's okay. -Hi. -Hey. Hey, Charlie... ...you don't mind if Donna stays and has some pizza, right? Oh, yeah, she can stay. -There's some plates in the kitchen. -Thank you, Dr. Johnson. For everything. Okay. I'm gonna take off and I'll catch you tomorrow, all right, buddy? All right, go ahead. You're up. -I'm up? I told you, I gotta go-- -You said you wanted to go again. I thought you said that. Don't you wanna go? You said you wanted to take another shot and stick around. Yep, that's what I said. ""Shadows of the Colossus."" -Hey. -Hey. Where are you? Did you pick the girls up yet? Going right now. What are you doing? What do you think I'm doing? Cooking dinner. Janeane, I gotta tell you something, babe. I don't know how I got to the place where I'm not letting you in... ...but you're right, I'm not. And that's wrong. I gotta open up to you. Because I don't wanna be that guy, baby. I don't wanna be that guy. I don't know if anything I said even makes any sense, but.... Alan, just come home. I love you. I know I probably don't tell you that enough, but I do. I love you. Can you just pick the girls up and come home? I love you too. I'll be home in a minute, okay? You guys left this. Don't leave stuff laying around. I mean it. Hey. No, no, no, Kemp. Take this back upstairs. Kemp."
51,2009,Inglourious Basterds,American,"In 1941, SS colonel Hans Landa interrogates French dairy farmer Perrier La Padite as to the whereabouts of the last unaccounted-for Jewish family in the area. In exchange for the Germans agreeing to leave his family alone for the rest of the war, La Padite reveals that the Dreyfus family is hidden under the floor. Landa orders SS soldiers to shoot through the floorboards. The family is killed except for Shosanna, a young woman who escapes.
Three years later, Lieutenant Aldo Raine of the First Special Service Force recruits Jewish-American soldiers to the Basterds, who spread fear among the German soldiers by killing and scalping them. The Basterds also recruit sergeant Hugo Stiglitz, a German soldier who murdered thirteen Gestapo officers. Adolf Hitler interviews a German soldier, Private Butz, the only survivor of a Basterd attack on his squad. Raine carved the Nazi swastika into Butz's forehead with a knife so he could never hide that he served in the German Heer.
Shosanna is operating a cinema in Paris under an assumed name. She meets Fredrick Zoller, a German sniper who killed 68 soldiers in a single battle; Zoller is to star in a Nazi propaganda film, Stolz der Nation (Nation's Pride). Infatuated with Shosanna, Zoller convinces Joseph Goebbels to hold the premiere of the film at her cinema. Shosanna plots with her projectionist and lover, Marcel, to kill the Nazi leaders attending the premiere by setting the cinema ablaze.
Unknown to Shosanna, British Intelligence Corps Lieutenant Archie Hicox is also planning an attack at the premiere with the Basterds. Hicox goes to a tavern with Hugo Stiglitz and Basterd Wilhelm Wicki to meet an undercover agent, the German film star Bridget von Hammersmark. Hicox draws the attention of Wehrmacht Sergeant Wilhelm and Gestapo Major Dieter Hellstrom with his unusual accent, and eventually gives himself away by ordering three drinks and gesturing ""three"" with his index, middle and ring fingers, as opposed to the German way with the thumb, index and middle fingers. Covers blown, the men engage in a brief firefight, which leaves only Sergeant Wilhelm and an injured Hammersmark alive. Raine arrives and negotiates with Sergeant Wilhelm for Hammersmark's release. Wilhelm agrees to release Hammersmark, but is shot by her when he lowers his guard. Suspicious, Raine briefly tortures Hammersmark before she gains his trust, and informs him that Hitler will be attending the film premiere, prompting him to decide to continue the mission despite the death of all German speaking Basterds. Meanwhile, Landa investigates the aftermath at the tavern and finds one of Hammersmark's shoes and a napkin with her signature.
At the premiere, two of the Basterds, Donny Donowitz and Omar Ulmer, join Raine in posing as Italians, hoping to fool the Germans unfamiliar with the language. Landa, who speaks fluent Italian, converses and quickly sees through their cover, but sends Donowitz and Ulmer, who are strapped in dynamite, to their seats without exposing them. Landa takes Hammersmark to a private room where he verifies that the shoe from the tavern fits her, then he strangles her to death. He arrests the remaining two Basterds, Raine and Smithson ""The Little Man"" Utivich. Landa has Raine contact his superior with the OSS and cuts a deal: he will allow the mission to proceed in exchange for immunity from his war crimes and other rewards.
During the screening, Zoller slips away to the projection room to see Shosanna. After she rejects his advances, he becomes aggressive. She pretends to acquiesce, then pulls a pistol from her bag and shoots him. As Zoller lies on the floor, mortally wounded, Shosanna turns back to the projection and watches Zoller's film, in which he is being portrayed as a brave war hero. Remorseful, Shosanna moves to embrace Zoller, who raises his pistol in response and shoots her before they both die. As Stolz der Nation reaches its climax, it cuts to spliced-in footage of Shosanna telling the audience that they are about to be killed by a Jew. Marcel, having locked the doors of the auditorium, ignites a pile of flammable nitrate film behind the screen as Shosanna's image laughs. Ulmer and Donowitz break into the box containing Hitler and Goebbels, killing them, then fire their submachine guns into the crowd until their dynamites go off, killing everyone in the theater. Landa and his radio operator drive Raine and Utivich into Allied territory, where they surrender. Raine shoots the radio operator and carves a swastika into Landa's forehead.",8.3,tt0361748,"While I'm very familiar with you and your family, I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am. Are you aware of my existence? Yes. This is good. Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France? Yes. Please tell me what you've heard. I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile. The Führer couldn't have said it better himself. But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me. The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing. I'm aware of that. I've read the reports of this area. But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts, most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless. I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite. If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family. Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself. Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses. Is that correct? To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers. Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe? Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable. Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses. Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished. Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them. What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite? Only rumors. I love rumors! Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing. So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses? Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain. So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape? Yes. Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names? There were five of them. The father, Jacob. Wife, Miram. And her brother, Bob. How old is Bob? Thirty, 31. Continue. And the children, Amos and Shosanna. Ages of the children? Amos was nine or 10. And Shosanna? And Shosanna was or 19. I'm not really sure. Well, I guess that should do it. However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk? But of course. Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me? I have no interest in such things. But you are aware of what they call me. I'm aware. What are you aware of? That they call you ""The Jew Hunter."" Precisely. I understand your trepidation in repeating it. Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him. Actually, why he would hate the name ""the Hangman"" is baffling to me. It would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it. Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it. The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers, I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German. More precisely, a German soldier. Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk. But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat. The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing. But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult. Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in. It's a hostile world, indeed. If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility? I suppose I would. Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them? Rats spread disease. They bite people. Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago. I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry. Would you agree? Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you? No. Yet, they're both rodents, are they not? And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they? It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel. However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel. If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk? Probably not. I didn't think so. You don't like them. You don't really know why you don't like them. All you know is you find them repulsive. Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide. But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide. However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me. Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity. May I smoke my pipe as well? Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home. Now, my job dictates that I must have my men enter your home and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list. And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be. That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary. I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment. Actually, quite the contrary. It will be met with reward. And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country. You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not? Yes. You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you? Yes. Point out to me the areas where they're hiding. Since I haven't heard any disturbance, I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English. Yes. I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade. Is that clear? Yes. It's the girl. Au revoir, Shosanna! Ten-hut! My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine. And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers. Eight Jewish American soldiers. Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon. Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier. We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians. Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only. Killing Nazis. I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5, miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity. Nazi ain't got no humanity. They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed. That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die. Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger. That means I got a little Indian in me. And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance. We will be cruel to the Germans. And through our cruelty, they will know who we are. And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us. And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives. And the German will be sickened by us. And the German will talk about us. And the German will fear us. And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with. Sound good? Yes, sir! That's what I like to hear. But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors. When you join my command, you take on debit. A debit you owe me, personally. Each and every man under my command owes me Nazi scalps. And I want my scalps. And all y'all will get me Nazi scalps taken from the heads of dead Nazis. Or you will die trying! Hey, Hirschberg. Send that Kraut sarge over. You. Go. Sergeant Werner Rachtman. Lieutenant Aldo Raine. Pleased to meet you. You know what ""sit down"" means, Werner? Yes. Then sit down. How is your English, Werner? Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate. Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good. Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for. Another one up there you might be familiar with. Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz. Heard of him? Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz. The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple. As a German-enlisted man, he killed Gestapo officers. Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of. Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there. Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz? Lieutenant Aldo Raine. These are the Basterds. Ever heard of us? We just want to say we're a big fan of your work. When it comes to killing Nazis... ...I think you show great talent. And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent. But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur. We all come here to see if you want to go pro. Can I assume you know who we are? You're Aldo the Apache. Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business. We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming. Oh, yeah. Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out. Either kill you or let you go. Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you. Up the road a piece, there's an orchard. Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere. If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight. So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are. You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them. You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger. Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect. I need to know about Germans hiding in trees. And you need to tell me. And you need to tell me right now. Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with. I respectfully refuse, sir. Hear that? Yes. That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz. You might know him better by his nickname. The Bear Jew. Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew. I heard of The Bear Jew. What did you hear? Beats German soldiers with a club. He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does. And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse, I'm calling The Bear Jew over. He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it. Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know. Fuck you. And your Jew dogs. Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that. Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies. Donny! Yeah? Got us a German here who wants to die for country. Oblige him. Did you get that for killing Jews? Bravery. Yeah! Oh, no! - Oh, no! Donny! Yeah, Donny! About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you. Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park! Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame! He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street! You! Damn it, Hirschberg! Donny, bring that other one over here. Alive! Get the fuck up! Batter up. You're on deck! Two hits. I hit you, you hit the ground. English? Wicki. Ask him if he wants to live. Tell him to point out on this map the German position. Ask him how many Germans. Around about 12. What kind of artillery? Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us. They'll shoot you. They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live. So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find. Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do? He's going to hug his mother. Well, ain't that nice? Ask if he's going to take off his uniform. He's going to burn it. Yeah, that's what we thought. We don't like that. See, we like our Nazis in uniforms. That way you can spot them. Just like that. But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi. And that don't sit well with us. So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off. You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that. You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you? Practice. Au revoir, Shosanna! At that time, millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar. Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle. They're films, ain't they? - Yes. Then they're flammable. Go on, hop off. Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper. Shosanna has a collection of over nitrate film prints. Right this way, Lieutenant. Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir. General Ed Fenech. At ease, Hicox. Drink? If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water. That-a-boy, Lieutenant. Make it yourself like a good chap, will you? The bar is in the globe. Something for yourself, sir? Whiskey. Straight. No junk in it. It says here that you speak German fluently. Like a Katzenjammer Kid. And your occupation before the war? I'm a film critic. List your accomplishments. Well, sir, such as they are, I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published. Impressive. Don't be modest, Lieutenant. What are their titles? The first book was called Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind: A Study of German Cinema in the '20s. And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci. It's a subtextual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst. What should we drink to, sir? Well... Down with Hitler. All the way down, sir. Yes. Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich? Yes. Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it. Explain it to me. Pardon, sir? Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich. Explain to me UFA under Goebbels. Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema. An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood. How's he doing? Frightfully sorry, sir. Once again? You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game. Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer, how's he doing? Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years. But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number. I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick. Brief him. Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino. Three days from now Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris. What film, sir? The motion picture is called Nation's Pride. In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry. The master race at play? Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket. The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket. And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth. Jolly good, sir. An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist. The Germans call them the Basterds. The Basterds. Never heard of them. Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them. But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil. You'll be dropped into France, about kilometers outside of Paris. The Basterds will be waiting for you. First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine. In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane. There you'll rendezvous with our double agent. She'll take it from there. She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere. It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds. She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need. How will I know her? I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you. Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark. Bridget von Hammersmark? The German movie star is working for England? Yes, for the last two years now. One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild. Indeed. Got the gist? I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles. You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement. I didn't know. You said it was in a tavern. It is a tavern. Yeah, in a basement. You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties. Number one being, you're fighting in a basement. What if we go in there and she's not even there? We wait. Don't worry. She's a British spy. She'll make the rendezvous. Stiglitz, right? That's right, sir. I hear you're pretty good with that. You know, we're not looking for trouble right now. Simply making contact with our agent. Should be uneventful. However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful, I need to know we can all remain calm. I don't look calm to you? Well, now that you put it like that, I guess you do. This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he? Is that the kind of man you need? Loquacious type? Fair point, Lieutenant. So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do? Make bets on how it all comes out? If we get into trouble, we can handle it. But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement. If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput. Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous? She chose the spot. Isn't that just dandy? Look, she's not a military strategist. She's just an actress. You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement. She wasn't picking a place to fight. She was picking a place isolated and without Germans. Mmm. Well, if this is it, old boy, I hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's. By all means, Captain. There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch. Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily, I must say, damn good stuff, sir. Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in. It would appear there's only one thing left for you to do. And what would that be? Stiglitz. Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls. You outside. Who are you? British? American? What? We're American. What are you? I'm a German, you idiot. Speak English pretty good for a German. I agree. So let's talk. Okay, talk. I'm a father. My baby was born today. In Frankfurt. Five hours ago. His name is Max. We were in here drinking, celebrating. They're the ones that came in shooting and killing. It's not my fault! Okay! It wasn't your fault. What's your name, soldier? Wilhelm. Now, is there anybody alive on our side? No. I'm alive! Who's that? Is the girl on your side? Which girl? Who do you think? Von Hammersmark. Yeah, she's ours. Is she okay? Wilhelm! She's been shot. But she's alive. Okay, Wilhelm. What do you say we make us a deal? What's your name? Aldo. Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal. You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away. No guns. No guns me, no guns you. And we take the girl and leave. It's that simple, Willi. You go your way, we go ours. And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy. So what do you say, Willi? We got us a deal? Aldo. I'm here, Willi. I want to trust you. But... But how can I? What choice you got, son? Okay, okay. Aldo, I'm going to trust you. Come down. Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun? I thought we had us a deal? We still have a deal. Now, get the girl and go. Not so fast. We only got a deal, we trust each other. And a Mexican standoff ain't trust. You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff. You got guns on us. You decide to shoot, we're dead. Up top, they got grenades. They drop them down here, you're dead. That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal. No trust, no deal. All right, Aldo. Fine. Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight. Not so goddamn fast, doc. Tell him to go play with his dogs. Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions. Few questions about what? About I got three men dead back there. Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened? The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it. Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis? I can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd. Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English. It's called suspicious. Everybody needs to calm down. You're letting your imagination get the better of you. You met the sergeant yourself. Willi. You remember him, don't you? Yeah, I remember him. His wife had a baby tonight. He had just become a... He had just become a father! His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate. The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence. It couldn't be both. How'd the shooting start? The Englishman gave himself away. How'd he do that? He ordered three glasses. We order three glasses. That's the German three. The other looks odd. Germans would and did notice it. Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to. What was the next step? Tuxedos. To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide. But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else. I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight. How'd you intend to get them in that premiere? Hand me my purse. Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort. The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant. You still get us in that premiere? You speak German better than your friends? No. Have I been shot? Yes! I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon. Least of all, by tomorrow night. However, there's something you don't know. There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino. One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue. Enormous change at the last minute? That's not very Germatic. Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar? It probably has something to do with the second development. Which is? Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere. Fuck a duck! What are you thinking? I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color. What is that supposed to mean? It means you getting us in that premiere. I'm probably going to end up losing this leg. Bye-bye, acting career. Fun while it lasted. How do you expect me to walk the red carpet? Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam. He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story. That's German, ain't it? You all like climbing mountains, don't you? I don't. I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants. But I see your point. We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet. I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English? We both speak a little Italian. With an atrocious accent, no doubt. But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib. Germans don't have a good ear for Italian. So you mumble Italian and brazen through it. Is that the plan? That's about it. That sounds good. It sounds like shit. What else are we going to do? Go home? No, that sounds good. If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building. Who does what? Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort. Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman. Omar, third most. He'll be Donny's assistant. I don't speak Italian. Like I said, third best. Just keep your fucking mouth shut. In fact, why don't you start practicing right now? Yes. Gorlomi? Gorlomi. Gorlomi. Antonio Margheriti. Margheriti. Margheriti. Dominick Decocco. Dominick Decocco. What's that American expression? ""If the shoe fits, you must wear it."" Fucking shithead. Faggot fuck. Fuck you! Bunch of shithead fuck. Fuck you, too! Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches! Get your hands off me. You fucking bratwurst-smelling... Goddamn you! Get off! Hmm. You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling... As Stanley said to Livingstone, Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume? Hans Landa. You've had a nice long run, Aldo. Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS. My hands to be exact. And they've been waiting a long time to touch you. Caught you flinching. Touch me again, Kraut-burger. Utivich? Is that you, Lieutenant? Yeah. Do you know what happened to Donny? Omar? The woman? No, I do not. Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy? Nope. What is that English expression about shoes and feet? ""Looks like the shoe is on the other foot."" - Yeah, I was just thinking that. So you're Aldo the Apache. So you're The Jew Hunter. I'm a detective. A damn good detective. Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people. And, yes, some of them were Jews. But Jew Hunter? Just a name that stuck. Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy. Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you? Aldo the Apache and the Little Man? What do you mean the Little Man? Germans' nickname for you. The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man? And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life. I mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest. Where's my men? Where's Bridget von Hammersmark? Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved. And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for. Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar... How you know our names? Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors, we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed. No, I guess not. Well, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs. As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in. Double-zero and double-zero 24, if my memory serves. Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode. And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go. That's a pretty exciting story. What's next? Eliza on Ice? However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput. If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs. I have no doubt. And, yes, some Germans will die. Yes, it will ruin the evening. And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night. But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann. And you need all four to end the war. But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four. And if you get all four, you end the war tonight. So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight. So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves. Wouldn't you agree? I guess so. How about you, Utivich? I guess so, too. Gentlemen, I have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal. If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal. What kind of deal? The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make. However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer. A general. I'm betting for... OSS would be my guess. That's a bingo! Is that the way you say it? ""That's a bingo."" You just say, ""Bingo."" Bingo! How fun. But I digress. Where were we? Yeah! Make a deal. Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann. Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender. If that tastes better going down. You know, where I'm from... Yeah? Where is that exactly? Maynardville, Tennessee. I've done my share of bootlegging. Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits. Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't. Sitting in your chair, I would probably say the same thing, and 999. times out of a million, you would be correct. But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand. What shall the history books read? I implore you. We must destroy that tower. Sarge, that tower... The tower stands! Psst! Psst! So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent. Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans. And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise. By the way, that last part is actually true. I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank. I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich. In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. Full citizenship for myself. Well, that goes without saying. And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket Island as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end. Do you have all that, sir? I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir. Lieutenant Raine? Right here. Yes, sir. Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners. Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines. Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you. You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant? Yes, sir. Over and out. When I kill that guy, you got feet to get to that guard. Can you do it? I have to. Champagne? Who wants to send a message to Germany? I have a message for Germany. That you are all going to die. And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it! Marcel, burn it down. Oui, Shosanna. My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face of Jewish vengeance. Hermann, uncuff them. I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine. We're your prisoners. How about my knife? Thank you very much, Colonel. Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back. Is that really necessary? I'm a slave to appearances. Scalp Hermann. Are you mad? What have you done? I made a deal with your general for that man's life! Yeah, they made that deal. But they don't give a fuck about him. They need you. You'll be shot for this! Nah, I don't think so. More like chewed out. I've been chewed out before. You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass. End the war tonight? I'd make that deal. How about you, Utivich? You make that deal? I'd make that deal. I don't blame you. Damn good deal. And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself. Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command, I suppose that's worth certain considerations. But I do have one question. When you get to your little place on Nantucket Island, I imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours. Ain't you? That's what I thought. Now, that I can't abide. How about you, Utivich, can you abide it? Not one damn bit, sir. I mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life. But I'm aware that ain't practical. I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off. So, I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off. You know something, Utivich? I think this just might be my masterpiece.

52,2003, Elephant,American,"Mr. McFarland is driving erratically down a residential street on the way to drop off his son John. John notices damage to the car and realizes that his father is drunk, so John instructs him to move to the passenger seat and let him drive.
Alex and Eric are bullied at school by the so-called jocks, one of whom diverts a teacher and throws a spitball at Alex during science class. Later, Alex and Eric are shown at home ordering weapons from a website and receiving a rifle in the mail. While Alex is taking a shower, Eric gets in with him. He claims that he has never been kissed, and the two kiss. The two formulate an attack plan. The next day, Alex and Eric prepare for the shooting, then make their way to school in silence in Alex's car.
After arriving at school, Alex and Eric encounter John outside and tell him to leave, as some ""heavy shit's about to go down"". Realizing what is about to happen, John attempts to warn others not to enter the school, to mixed effect as a few students listen to him but others, as well as a teacher, do not and enter into the building. He also tries to find an adult to get help from but cannot. The two gunmen then enter the school, and after their plans to blow up parts of the school with propane bombs fail, begin shooting indiscriminately. A friendly student named Elias photographs them entering the library where they open fire, shooting several students, including a bespectacled outcast named Michelle and presumably Elias.
Realizing that the gunfire is real, students now begin to panic, while teachers attempt to quickly evacuate the building; an African-American student named Benny silently walks the halls and helps some students escape to safety with aplomb while nearing Alex. John's worthless father shows up and can offer no consolation to his devastated son as they see the school burning and hear gunshots and screams. The two boys separate, continuing their killing spree. Alex enters the bathroom where three popular girls named Brittany, Jordan and Nicole are, presumably shooting all three. The school principal, Mr. Luce, cornered by Eric in a hallway, begs Eric to lower his weapon and talk to him, but Eric yells, ""I ain't putting shit down!"" and fires at him. He does speak to Mr. Luce, however; while he is doing so, he turns without warning to see an approaching Benny and shoots and kills him before Benny could stop Eric's attack. Eric turns back to Luce and warns him to take heed of what's happened from bullied students and initially lets Mr. Luce go, before smiling evilly and changing his mind by firing several shots down the hall that strike and kill the principal.
Alex enters the cafeteria, which is strewn with overturned chairs, backpacks, several dead bodies, and numerous abandoned half-eaten lunches, and sits down. Alex picks up a cup from an abandoned lunch and casually drinks from it. Eric meets up with him, and they have a brief conversation, which ends when Alex shoots Eric in mid-sentence. Alex leaves the cafeteria, showing no emotion over shooting Eric, and discovers Carrie and Nathan in a freezer. He tauntingly recites ""Eeny, meeny, miny, moe"" to them to decide whom he should kill first. The film then cuts to credits leaving the ending ambiguous.",8.2,tt0080678,"Darling, don't be difficult. Let's take our sweet... Iovely children on an outing. You can't do this. I know my rights. I have the authority to close you down, and I'm doing just that. This exhibit degrades everybody who sees it and the creature himself. He is a freak! How else will he live? Freaks are one thing. This is entirely different. This is monstrous and should not be allowed. These officers will see to it you're on your way soon. Good day! Move along please. Hold it there, sir. Come this way. On the move again... my treasure. We'll be seeing a lot more of these machine accidents... - Mr. Hodges. - Yes, sir. Abominable things, these machines. You can't reason with them. What a mess! Pull on the rope. Irons, please. Who is it? - Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir. - Yes, what is it? - I found it. - Good. Did you see it? All right. I'll see you in a moment. Thank you. Who's that? - A friend of mine. - Oh, yes. - What are you up to? - Nothing. Come on, Freddie! Nothing of any importance. Can you tell me where Cleeves Street is? 'Round back, to the left, then to the right. Straight through. Thank you. Are you the proprietor? And who might you be, sir? Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it. I don't think so. No, sir, we're... closed. Now, I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor? Handsomely? Who sent you? - I beg your pardon? - Never mind. I'm the owner. Life... is full of surprises. Consider the fate... of this creature's poor mother... struck down... in the fourth month of her maternal condition... by an elephant, a wild elephant. Struck down... on an uncharted African isle. The result... is plain to see. Ladies and gentlemen... the terrible... Elephant Man! - Stand up. - Stand up! Turn around. Turn around! Turn around! Yes... you'll bring him to me tomorrow morning at 10:00, Mr... . Bytes. He'll be there. Good. Here's my card, and I'll send a cab. All right? We have a deal. We understand each other. More than money has changed hands. We understand each other completely, my friend. Yes, well, thank you, Mr. Bytes. Tomorrow. Cor! What a stink! I'm looking for Mr. Frederick Treves... please, ma'am. Very well. I'll-I'll send for him. Nurse... Oh, Mr. Treves, sir, this... - This... - Yes. Thank you. Yes, I was expecting him. - Yes, are you the cab driver? - Yes, sir. - Anyone else with you? - No, sir. Just this gentleman. - Thank you for your troubles. - Not at all, sir. My pleasure. Thank you. Will you come this way, please? Mrs. Mothershead, I'll be in my room, and I'm not to be disturbed. - All right? - Of course, sir. Will you come with me, please? You heard what the doctor said! Go on. My name is Frederick Treves... and I'm a surgeon here at the London Hospital. And... I lecture in anatomy at the medical college. I'd like very much to examine you so that... Would that be all right? Please. First I'd like to ask you a few questions. Would that be all right? Your owner tells me... I mean the man who looks after you tells me... that you're English and your name is John Merrick. John Merrick. Is that right? I tell you what. I think I'll ask you a question... and you shake your head like this for ""no."" Have you always been the way you are now? Are you in any pain? Are your parents still alive? Do you understand me? Your father and your mother, are they dead? Freddie, what are you doing for... Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry. I had no idea you had... Freddie, what the hell have you got in there? You'll know soon enough, at the meeting of the Society. Until then, I beg of you not a word to anyone, please. All right, if you insist. But you must have quite a find in there. - I don't know what I've got. - Nothing of any importance, eh? Not a word, please, Fox. Not a word. All right. Thank you. It's all right. I think I'll examine you now. I'll leave the questions till later. All right? Will you take your hat off now, please? Don't be frightened. I simply want to look at you. Take your hat off. Don't be frightened. Thank you. Good afternoon. Mr. Thomas, Mr. Rogers. Pull the curtains aside. He is English... he is years of age... and his name is John Merrick. Gentlemen, in the course of my profession I have come upon... many lamentable deformities of the face due to injury or disease... as well as mutilations... and contortions of the body depending upon like causes. But at no time have I met with such... a perverted or degraded version of a human being as this man. I draw your attention to the insidious conditions affecting him. - Can you see over there? - Yes. Note, if you will, the extreme enlargement of the skull... right upper limb, which is totally useless... the alarming curvature of the spine. - Would you turn around, please? - Turn around, please. The looseness of the skin... and the varying fibrous tumors that cover 90 of the body. And there is every indication that these afflictions have been... in existence and have progressed rapidly since birth. The patient also suffers from chronic bronchitis. As an interesting side note... in spite of the aforementioned anomalies... the patient's genitals remain entirely intact and unaffected. Thank you. And his left arm is perfectly normal, as you see. So then, gentlemen, owing to this series of conditions... the congenital skull exostosis, extensive papillomatous growth... large pendulous masses in connection with the skin... the great enlargement of the right upper limb... involving all the bones, the massive distortion of the head... and the extensive area covered by papillomatous growth... the patient has been called the Elephant Man. Thank you. You never mentioned his mental state. Oh, he's an imbecile, probably from birth. The man's a complete idiot. I pray to God he's an idiot. Where have you been? Out. How can I eat with a noise like that? Bytes, don't! Where have you been? What did you do? - Our man is sick. Come right away. - What is it? Like this. What did you do with him? He's been like this all night. He was fine when he left here. Now look at him. Yes, I intend to. - What happened? - He fell! He falls. Looks like he's had a very severe fall. He's a clumsy soul. Never looks where he's going. But that's all right. He has me to take care of him. Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest. Well, that's how he sleeps. If he lies down, he'll kill himself. His head's too big. All right. This man belongs in a hospital. Can't you treat him here? Listen, he's my livelihood. We're business partners, he and I. He's the greatest freak in the world. Yes, now you listen. You won't have much of a livelihood if he dies. Now, stop wasting my time. I'm going to fetch a cab. I truly, truly appreciate this, my friend. Listen. There are a lot of things I could do for you. You see, I move in the proper circles for this type of thing. In fact, anything at all... if you take my meaning. Everything will be taken care of. It's good to do business with you. Here we go. All right. Can I have a bowl of oatmeal, please? Yes, sir. Breakfasting with the patients this morning, Mr. Treves? Yes. No, it's for a patient. There you are, sir. Thank you. Morning. Morning. Oh, Treves! Just come here for a moment, will you? What's that? Good heavens! You haven't acquired a sudden taste for this, have you? - Yes, sir. It's quite nutritious. - Possibly. Not quite the diet for a grown man. Nurse! When you have a moment... take this up to the patient in the isolation ward, will you? Yes, sir. Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you. Won't he indeed! Just a minute, Treves. Something I want to say to you. Come in. A hospital's no place for secrecy, you know, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about is apt to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted? Why is he in the isolation ward? He's not contagious, is he? No, sir. He's got chronic bronchitis and he's been badly beaten. Why isn't he in the general ward then? Well, sir, he's quite seriously deformed... and I fear the other patients would find him rather shocking. Deformed? Is that it? Am I to assume then that he is ultimately incurable? Yes, sir. But you must be aware that this hospital doesn't accept incurables. The rules are perfectly clear. Yes, sir, I'm well aware of that... but this case is quite exceptional. I quite appreciate your problem, Mr. Treves. Why not contact the British Home or the Royal Hospital for Incurables? They might find a place for him. I'll look into it. Would you like to meet him? Excuse me. The Elephant Man. Sorry. I should have warned you. Please forgive me. - You all right? - Yes, sir. Please ask Mrs. Mothershead to come up here. Tell her to knock on the door and wait for me. I'm sorry about that. L... We'll bring you another breakfast. You must be very hungry. And I think you'll be quite comfortable here for a while. I'll see to it that you have everything you need. Cor blimey! So, this is the Elephant Man. I ain't seen nothing like you before. What the bleedin' hell happened to ya? Dumb, eh? I like people that can keep quiet. Here, have a drink. Go on! No? You should be more sociable, mate. You'll get yourself disliked. You and I are gonna be good friends... and I've got a lot of friends who'd like to meet you. And they will, mate. Believe me, they will. I've brought your breakfast. What are you doing down there? Come on, up on the bed. All he understands is a good smack. He's had his share of smacks. That's what drives him under the bed. You have to treat him with kindness and patience. Perhaps you've got time for that sort of treatment, Mr. Treves. But I haven't. I've got a hospital to run. Now, don't you waste your time with him, sir. It's like talking to a brick wall. Now, I don't mean to be harsh but... he doesn't belong here. Honestly, sir, honestly, what can you do for him? Oh, and by the way, Mr. Carr Gomm said... he would like to see you when you can spare a moment. - Yes. - Right. I can't help you unless you help me. You see, I believe there's something that you want to say to me. Something back there. I can't help you unless you help me, you know! I believe you want to say something to me, don't you? I've got to understand what you're feeling, what you're thinking. Do you understand me? All right, just nod your head if you can... Can you understand me? Just nod your head if you understand me. All right. You do understand. I want to hear... I want to hear you talk. We're gonna show them that you're not a wall. Understand? I want you to talk to me. All right, now, I want to hear you say it. I've got to hear how you say things. I won't hurt you. I've got to hear and understand how you say things. Very slowly, I want you to say, ""Yes."" Say, ""Yes."" Yes. Yes! Good. All right, now, just once more say it again. ""Yes."" Yes, I can understand that. That's good. That's very good. All right now. I'm going to say some words to you, and I want you to repeat them. Do you understand? Say, ""Hello. My name is..."" Hello. My name is... ""John Merrick."" No. John... That's very good. Say, ""John Merrick."" ""Hello. My name is John Merrick."" Hello. My name is... John Merrick. You can speak. How did you get up here? I want my man back. - Just a moment. How did you get up? - Never mind that. I want my man. He's still very sick. Please, come downstairs with me, and I'll explain the situation. Don't! Don't. You've had plenty of time to... cure him. And now he's leaving with me. Do you understand me now, Mr. Treves? We made a deal. You misunderstood. This man has suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now. Pull the other one, why don't you? Mr. Bytes, I'm sorry. But all you do is profit from another man's misery. Do you think you're better than me? No, I never said that. You wanted the freak... to show to those doctor chums of yours, to make a name for yourself. You, my friend. I gave you the freak on trust... in the name of science... and now I want him back! You do not own this man! Now stop it! I want him back! So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the streets would fare better with you! I shall go to the authorities. Go to the authorities then! Go to them by all means. They'll be very interested to hear your story as well as ours. Now... I think we really do understand one another. All right. Singularly unattractive character, I must say. Well, Treves, it seems to me I might as well meet this patient of yours. Thank you very much. Thank you. Shall we say in a few days then? Shall we say 2:00 tomorrow afternoon? Yes. Well, whatever's most convenient for you, sir. 2:00 then, tomorrow. Thank you very much. 2:00! Morning, Mr. Treves. Early again, I see. Yes. With these early habits of yours, you'd have made a good milkman. - I'll keep that in mind, Charles. - Okay, sir. Good morning. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me into paths of... for His name's sake. Righteousness. Righteousness. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness... for His name's sake. Good. That's very good. Good. When your visitor comes today, say it exactly the way you've said it. So when I introduce him to you, say the words that you've learned. If you have trouble with any words, I'll help you, so don't worry. I will introduce him to you and say... ""Please meet Mr. Carr Gomm."" And you will say? Hello. My name is John Merrick. I'm very pleased to meet you. Good! Good. I'll go and get Mr. Carr Gomm. It is only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of... the constrictive deformity of the mouth, but he can talk. Talking's one thing, but is he able to understand what's said to him? Yes. Oh, yes! Except... Except he's so anxious to make a good impression on you... that he might seem a little nervous. Come in. John... may I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm? Mr. Carr Gomm, this is John Merrick. Hello. My name is John Merrick. I'm very pleased to meet you. I'm very pleased to meet you. How are you feeling today? I feel much better. Are you comfortable here? Everybody's been very kind. How is your bronchitis? Mr. Merrick likes the food here, don't you? Much better than what I'm used to. Oh, yes? Yes. And what was that? Potatoes. I understood that you'd been flogged. I feel much better now. That's splendid. How do you find Mr. Treves? As a teacher, I mean. Everybody's been very kind. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview? Everybody's been very kind. Yes, of course, I understand. Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day to you. Very good, John. It was very good. I'll be back in a moment. The Lord is my shepherd... I shall not want. He maketh me lie down... It was a brave attempt, but the man was mouthing words taught by you. Yes. Well, I'm sorry to have wasted your time. He restoreth my soul. He simply doesn't belong here. He'd be better off somewhere where he can be constantly looked after. I'm sorry things have turned out this way. Good day to you. Yea... though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... I fear no evil... for Thou art with me. Thy rod and staff, they... Mr. Carr Gomm! Yes, what is it? It's that. I didn't teach him that part. Surely goodness and mercy... will follow me all the days of my life... and I'll dwell in the house of the Lord forever. How did you know the rest of it? I didn't teach you the rest of it. It's very strange. Tell me, how did you know the rest of it? The 23rd Psalm. I used to read the Bible every day. I know it very well... and the Book of Common Prayer. The 23rd Psalm is very beautiful. It's my favorite. Treves, come and see me in my office when you're through up here. There's something important I want to say to you. Good-bye, Mr. Merrick. I do hope we shall meet again. Well, why didn't you tell me you could read? I was frightened. I see. I was afraid to talk. Please forgive me. Can you imagine the kind of life he must have had? Yes, I think I can. I don't believe so. No one could possibly imagine it. I don't believe any of us can! ""Terrible though his appearance is... so terrible indeed that women and nervous persons... fly in horror from the sight of him... and that he is debarred from seeking to earn his livelihood in any way... yet he is superior in intelligence. He can read and write, he's quiet, gentle... not to say even refined in his mind."" I should very much like to meet this gentleman. Have you seen this? Listen to this. Hey up! Hey up! Now listen. This is a letter to the London Times... from the governor of the hospital. ""There is now in a little room off one of our attic wards... a man named John Merrick. So dreadful a sight that he is unable... even to come out by daylight to the garden. He is being called the Elephant Man... on account of his terrible deformity. His appearance is so terrible that women and nervous persons... fly in terror at the sight of him."" And how do you get tickets to see him? Your very own Sunny Jim. - Let's go and see him then! - All right, keep your shirt on. The time must be right. Right now he's in the attic. But tomorrow they're moving him to Bedstead Square right into my lap. Then, for the right price... you will see something you'll never ever see again in your life! Well, don't look so glum, girls. Enthusiastic volunteers should be more cheerful, hmm? Put your collar straight, girl. And remember... that under no circumstances... whatsoever... are any mirrors to be brought into this room. Yes, Mrs. Mothershead. Yes. All right. - He's so ugly. - Ugly or not, you're gonna help me. Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick? Yes. You look very nice in your new clothes. Thank you very much. If there's nothing else, I suppose we'll be leaving you now. No, there's nothing. You ready for tea? Please go in, John. Make yourself comfortable. Come along, meet our guest. Mr. Merrick, I'd like you to meet my wife, Anne. Anne, this is John Merrick. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr. Merrick. I'm... I'm very pleased... What is it? What's the matter? It's just that l... I'm not used to being... treated so well by... a beautiful woman. Would you like a cup of tea, Mr. Merrick? That's a good idea. Would you like to come and see the rest of the house? I'll show you. How's your tea? It's very good! I'm enjoying my visit here very much. It's so kind of you to invite me into your own home. I'm sorry that I... made a spectacle of myself. No, not at all. I like the way... you arranged your pictures on the mantelpiece. Oh, thank you. Is that the way they do it in most houses? Yes, I'm sure they do, yes. Who are they of? These are relatives, and these are our children. Children? Oh, may I see? Yes, of course. Where are the children? Well, um, well, they're out with friends... at the moment. Friends. And here is Frederick's mother. Oh, how lovely. And these are my parents. They have such... noble faces. Yes, I've always... I've always thought so myself. Would you... Would you care to see my mother? Your mother? Yes, please. Oh, she's... Mr. Merrick, she's beautiful. Oh, she had... She had the face of an angel. I must've... been a great disappointment to her. No, Mr. Merrick. No son as loving as you could ever be a disappointment. If only I could find her... so she could see me... with such lovely friends here now. Perhaps she could... Iove me as I am. I've tried so hard to be good. I'm so sorry. Please. I'm so sorry. Please. Here. What's that you're doing? What is it? I see. It's St. Phillips. Why, that's very good. I mean, you got the windows and arches just right. I wish... I could sleep... like normal people. - Mr. Treves? - Yes? There's something that... I've been meaning to ask you... for some time now. What's that? Can you cure me? No, we can care for you... but we can't cure you. I thought not. Come in. - Good morning. - Good morning. There's someone here who'd like to meet you, if that's all right. May I introduce you to one of the bright lights... of the English stage, Mrs. Kendal. - Mrs. Kendal, Mr. John Merrick. - Good day, Mr. Merrick. Good day. I've brought you some things. I hope you like them. I hope you don't think it too forward. I knew you'd understand. I'll leave you together. Here. I want you to know, I don't go about giving my picture to just anyone. Oh, no. I wouldn't think of it. It's beautiful. You're so... I'll... Well, I'll... I shall put it in a... in a place of honor. Here, next to my mother. She's very pretty, your mother. Oh, yes. I see you're constructing a... church? Oh, no. It's a cathedral. You see? Only, I have to rely... on my imagination... for what I can't actually see. Mr. Treves tells me that you're in the theater. Do you live there? Oh, no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there. Well, it must be... wonderful just to work there. - Is it beautiful? - You've never been? I'm afraid not. Oh, Mr. Merrick. You must go. The theater's the most beautiful place on earth. Of course, I am a bit partial. The theater is romance. Romance. Which reminds me, I've brought you something else. - Thank you. - Have you read it? No, but I certainly shall. Romeo and Juliet. Yes, I've heard of this. ""If I profane with my unworthiest hand... this holy shrine... the gentle fine is this... My lips... two blushing pilgrims... ready stand to smooth that rough touch... with a tender kiss."" ""Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much... which mannerly devotion shows in this. For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch... and palm to palm is holy Palmer's kiss."" ""O, then dear saint... let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou... lest faith turn to despair."" ""Saints do not move... though grant for prayer's sake."" ""Then move not... while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips... by thine, my sin is purged."" Oh, yes. And then it says they kiss. ""Then have my lips the sin that they have took."" ""Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged. Give me my sin again."" Oh, Mr. Merrick. You're not an elephant man at all. You're Romeo. ""Mrs. Kendal, always at the forefront of fashion and form... was seen leaving the London the other afternoon. No, dear readers, the most facile actress of our day... has not been taken ill, but rather said she was visiting a friend. And who was the lucky recipient of this attention? Quick inquiries proved it to be none other than Mr. John Merrick... the Elephant Man, with whom our readers are undoubtedly familiar. After a chat of three quarters of an hour... Mrs. Kendal was kind enough to leave Mr. Merrick... with an autographed portrait of herself."" I saw it in his room. ""Owing to a disfigurement of the most extreme nature... Mr. Merrick has never been properly presented to London society. But knowing that wherever Mrs. Kendal goes... others inevitably follow, the question arises... 'Will London society present itself to him?""' This walking stick is so... is so dashing. Much more elegant than my old one. More tea? You see, I don't go out as often as I would like... because naturally... some people do find my appearance disturbing. If you have a chill, I could close the window. No, I'm fine. Please... I mean, thank you. Thank you. You see... people are frightened... by what they don't understand. And it is hard to understand even for me... because, well, my mother... she was so very beautiful. Mrs. Mothershead, I don't think he should have any more visitors today. I have to lecture at the college, so I'll be back this evening. Excuse me, but if you have the time, I would like a word with you. Excuse me, but if you have the time, I would like a word with you. - I'm awfully late. What is it? - Well, sir, I don't quite... I don't quite understand... why it is you allow that sort of people in there. Why? Because he enjoys it, and I think it's very good for him. Yes, but sir, you saw the expression on their faces. They didn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything about John. They only want to impress their friends. I think you're being rather harsh on them, don't you? I beg your pardon, sir. You yourself hardly showed him much loving kindness... when he first arrived, did you? I bathed him, I fed him and I cleaned up after him, didn't I? And I see that my nurses do the same. And if""loving kindness"" can be called care... and practical concern... then I did show him loving kindness and I am not ashamed to admit it. I didn't mean it exactly that way. Now, please believe me. Now, of course I appreciate your concern. I appreciate everything that you've done for Mr. Merrick. But I am the physician in charge and I must do what is best for him. - Please, now, I'm also very late. - If you ask my opinion... he's only being stared at all over again. Thank you. Night time. What's the matter, Freddie? I've been thinking about Mr. Bytes. What on earth made you think of him? Well, I'm beginning to believe that Mr. Bytes and I are very much alike. That's absurd. It seems that I've made Mr. Merrick... into a curiosity all over again, doesn't it? Only this time in a hospital rather than a carnival. My name is constantly in the papers... I'm always being praised to the skies. Patients are now expressly asking for my services. Of course they do, because you're a very fine doctor. John Merrick is happier and more fulfilled now... than he's ever been in his entire life... and it's completely due to you. What was it all for? Why did I do it? Freddie, what are you trying to say? Am I a good man... or am I a bad man? Steady on, Treves. Steady on, my dear fellow. Come sit down, won't you? Gentlemen, I know we usually open these proceedings... by reading the minutes. But on this occasion, in the interests of urgency... I think we should first conclude... the matter previously under discussion... the case of Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man. One moment, Mr. Chairman. As far as I'm concerned... this creature has no business being here at all. l, for one, am sick and tired... of this competitive freak-hunting... by these overly ambitious young doctors... trying to make names for themselves. To parade them about in front of the pathological society is one thing... but to waste this committee's valuable time... with requests for shelter for these abominations of nature is another. You must be more careful. In the light of these facts, our course is clear. The question is not whether to accept this creature as a patient. The question is, when will those rooms be vacated for use... by better qualified, more deserving cases? I move that this Elephant Man... be removed from the premises immediately. We have a sacred duty to cure the sick... not care for circus animals. That is my last word on the subject. Mr. Chairman, shall we vote? I take it, Mr. Broadneck, your mind is quite unshakable in this matter? Mr. Chairman, do you not have ears? I am unalterably opposed! My mind is made up on this! You shall not sway me. May we now vote, Mr. Chairman, at long last? Yes, Broadneck. I think the time has come. Gentlemen, Her Royal Highness... Alexandra, Princess of Wales. Good morning, gentlemen. I hope I am not disturbing you. On the contrary, ma'am. Your presence here... is always greatly appreciated. We were just taking a vote on Mr. Merrick. Her Royal Highness has shown the greatest interest in his fate. Indeed I have, sir, as has the queen. I have a brief communication from Her Majesty... which she has requested that I read to you. ""To the Governing Committee, London Hospital. I would very much like to commend you for the charitable face... you have shown Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man. It is laudable that you have provided... one of England's most unfortunate sons... with a safe and tranquil harbor, a home. For this immeasurable kindness... as well as the many other acts of mercy... on behalf of the poor... of which Mr. Carr Gomm has kept me informed... I gratefully thank you. Signed, Victoria."" I'm sure I can count on you gentlemen to do the Christian thing. Thank you very much, ma'am. I'm sure we shall all try. Gentlemen, I wish to move that Mr. John Merrick... be admitted to this hospital on a permanent basis... provided the hospital receives a yearly sum... equal to the cost of the occupation of one bed. All those in favor? Thank you, gentlemen. The motion is carried. Yes. Come in! Good afternoon. Mr. Carr Gomm has something he wants to say to you. Mr. Merrick, I have very great pleasure... in being able to welcome you officially... to the London Hospital. This morning, the governing committee unanimously voted... that you should be provided with these rooms on a permanent basis. This is your home now. I'm so very, very glad for you. Welcome home, lad. This is... my home? Yes. Please, will you thank the governing committee for me? I will do my utmost... to merit their kindness. This... is my home? Yes. This as well. Your dressing case. Oh, thank you. Thanks, all my friends. Thank you. - You like it? - Oh, my friends. Oh, my friends. Oh, thank you. - Who's next? - I say. - What, you again? - Yeah, but... But these young ladies have never seen it. You're on, mate. Okay, that's it for this performance. - Jim, can I go tonight? - Sit down, Charlie. There's always tomorrow. Don't worry. Room for one more? At the right price. There's room. All right, all right! Keep the noise down! We don't want to frighten him, do we? Hello. My name... is John Merrick... and I'm very, very pleased... to meet you. I think you are... very beautiful... Curtain time! You look beautiful, darling. I wouldn't change a thing. You look like the bleedin' Prince of Wales. Here, my friends... is the Elephant Man! I told you he was horrible. Just horrible. Perhaps the ladies would like a closer look? - Yeah, yeah. - No, Jack! There. He's quite a ladies' man, isn't he? Come on. Give the ladies' man a little kiss, eh? Come on. Give him a kiss. Here, here, here! That's enough romance. Time for beddy-byes. All right, all right. Keep the noise down. Now, keep it quiet. Quiet! Hey! Keep it quiet. Now, watch this. Okay, that's enough! That's enough! That's it. The show's over. I'll see you back at the Peacock. Get out of here. Here. Come on. There you are. That's better, isn't it? I've done well tonight. Here. Buy yourself a sweet. My treasure. - I know what happened last night. - What? Dear God. Boy! Where is he? Where's Mr. Merrick? Where is he? Where's Mr. Merrick? - I don't know what you mean, sir. - Don't lie to me! I know all about it. You were seen. You're involved with Bytes, aren't you? You've taken him. Where is he? Now, wait a minute. I haven't taken him anywhere. I don't know no Bytes. We were just having a bit of fun. We never hurt him. You know, just having a laugh, that's all. You bastard! He's gone! When I left him, he was in bed safe and sound! You bastard! You bastard! You're not listening to me! I told you, I don't know no Bytes! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay money to see your monster. I collect it. You're the monster! You're the freak! Now, get out! You're finished! You don't frighten me, you and your bleedin' Elephant Man. I'm glad what I done, and you can do nothing about it. Only Mothershead can sack me now! Done. There's something I'd like to tell you, Treves. You know, I felt as deeply as you did about John. Well, now he's disappeared... very likely to the continent. There's no question of your going after him. You're desperately needed here by your patients. You did everything in your power. Remember that, Treves. Everything in your power. Get the stool. Get up, you bastard. Look at all these beautiful animals. What a lot you have. That sly bastard. He's doing this to spite me! You're doing this to spite me... and it's got to stop! Bytes, he's sick! Let him die! But don't think I'm going to bury that... bag of flesh! Wrong! As a matter of fact... - Bytes, no! - As a matter of fact... Bytes, stop, please! Bytes, please, don't! We've decided... we're gonna get you out of here. All right? Good on you, mate. Good on you. Luck, my friend. Luck. And who needs it more than we? Hey, mister. Mister, why is your head so big? Why is your head so big, mister? Why is your head so big? Why won't you answer me? Why is your head so big, mister? Stop him! I am not an animal! I am not an animal! I am a human being! I am... a man! Excuse me, sir. Out of the way, sir. Excuse me. Mr. Treves, sir! They found him! I think they found John! Thank you. - Keep still, girl. - Sorry. That was very nice of Mrs. Kendal to give me this dress for tonight. It's so beautiful. Does Mrs. Kendal know that John is dying? Yes, she knows. How do I look? Splendid. Now, you will not look out of place. You look absolutely splendid. - Oh, splendid. Shall we go? - Yes. Again... I can't tell you how sorry I am for what happened. You see, I had no idea, really. Please, you mustn't blame yourself. Mr. Treves, don't worry about me... my friend. I am happy every hour of the day. My life is full because I know that I am loved. I have gained myself. I could not say that... were it not for you. Well, and l... You've done so much for me as well. Thank you. So... I'll fetch Mrs. Mothershead and Nora... and be back in a few minutes. Very good, my friend. My friend. Mrs. Kendal. Thank you. Your Royal Highness... ladies and gentlemen... tonight's performance was very special to me... because it was very special to someone else. A man who knows the theater and who loves the theater... and yet this is the very first time he's ever been here. I wish to dedicate... The whole company wishes to dedicate with all their hearts... tonight's performance... to Mr. John Merrick... my very dear friend. Stand up. They want to see you. Go on. It's all right. Just stand up. They want to see you. I really did believe that... the ogre would never get out of the dungeon. Good. So you really enjoyed yourself? It was wonderful! Good. Then we must go again some evening. Oh, yes. Oh, I hope so. Yes, we will. We will. Good. I'm pleased. Well, I ought to go. You must get some sleep. Good night, and sleep well. - And you too, my friend. - Yes. I'm so pleased you enjoyed yourself. Good night. Good night. It's finished. Never, oh, never nothing will die. The stream flows, the wind blows. The cloud fleets, the heart beats. Nothing will die."
53,2011,Soul Surfer,American,"In 2003, teenager Bethany Hamilton lives in Kauai, Hawaii with her parents Tom and Cheri, and two brothers, Noah and Timmy. All are surfers, but she and her best friend Alana Blanchard have grown up with a passion for the sport and enter a competition. Her church youth ministry leader, Sarah Hill, is disappointed when she has to withdraw from a planned mission trip to Mexico because of the contest.
In the competition, Bethany and Alana place first and third, respectively. The following day, Tom goes to the hospital for knee surgery, and the girls go surfing with Alana's father Holt and brother Byron. As Bethany dangles her left arm in the water, a tiger shark is swimming just under her surfboard and notices her arm floating in the water. It unexpectedly attacks, ripping off her arm below the shoulder. Holt, Alana, and Byron get her out of the water where Holt makes a tourniquet out of his swimshirt to put on her while Byron calls 911 as Cheri is also informed. An ambulance meets them on the way to the hospital. Just before starting Tom's knee surgery, Dr. David Rovinsky is called to the emergency room to treat Bethany. Besides losing her left arm, she also lost 60% of her blood and Dr. Rovinsky calls her survival a miracle.
The onslaught of paparazzi also proves to be a great strain on her family and their privacy. The Hamiltons are grateful to Holt for his quick and active thinking and decisive action that saved her life. Her injury prevents her from participating in the Rip Curl photo shoots, but she wishes Alana well.
Bethany perseveres and after a recuperation period, gets back in the water, and learns to surf with one arm. Inside Edition offers to provide a prosthetic one that is cosmetically perfect and has bendable joints, in exchange for an interview. She angrily rejects it when she learns it will not help her surf as it is not weight bearing, as a result of the size of her arm stump.
Bethany eventually re-enters the competition, telling rival Malina not to go easy on her, and rejects a five-minute head start offered by the judges. She does not perform well because she cannot stay on the board long enough to go out and catch a competitive wave so Malina wins. Disappointed at this loss, she decides to give up competitive surfing and her friendship with Alana is strained following an argument.
Bethany decides to surprise Sarah by joining the youth group on another mission trip to help the people of Phuket, Thailand who were devastated by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Despite her recent tragedy, she joins her youth group to help the Thai children get over their fear of the ocean. They are understandably afraid of the water, including a little boy. She decides to go into it with a surfboard, hoping this will coax him into it. It works, and the realization that she can use her gift to inspire people motivates her to take up surfing again.
Tom, who believes that Bethany possesses a great surfer's instinct for sensing when the best waves will form, rigs a handle on her surfboard which she can use to prevent falling off while paddling out to the waves, which is not prohibited by the competition's rules. Bethany trains for the competition while rekindling her friendship with Alana. She enters the national championship. During the competition, she performs respectably, though she is still chasing third place. Suddenly, with only minutes left on the clock, the waves die down and all the surfers can only loiter, waiting for the waves to start back up. Tom's belief in his daughter's instinct is proven when she is the only one to sense a big wave forming, and she alone paddles out. When it forms, the others cannot get out in time and she catches it just as the horn sounds. If it is in time, she will win, but the judges rule that the time has expired. Malina is the winner, but she has finally gotten over her differences with Bethany, inviting her up on the platform to share first place.
Subsequently, Bethany lets the reporters interview her. One asks her what she would do if given the chance to undo the loss of her arm. She says that she would still lose it because she can embrace more people now than she ever could with both.",7.0,tt1596346,"I was born in Hawaii to two die-hard surfers. How could I not have salt water in my veins? They say home is where the heart is. And for most people, that consists of four walls and a welcome mat. But for me, it's the ocean. With the warmth of the sun on my skin. ""Two brothers."" That's my answer when anyone asks me why I'm so competitive. And, of course, there's my best friend Alana. - Trick or treat! - Trick or treat! We spent more time wet than we did dry. My mom was convinced that we were mermaids. From the moment I caught my first wave, I knew that I wanted to be a pro surfer. Nothing else seemed to matter. Surfing is my passion, my way of life. The stoke I get from riding a perfect wave is pure joy. But like my dad always says, ""Life is an adventure. ""And sometimes, you wipe out and end up in the impact zone."" Bethany! Bethany! Let's go, you're lagging! I'm coming! Hey, sorry, Noah, I lost track of time! Glad you could join us. - Move over, Timmy. - Sorry, this seat's saved. Come on. - How were the waves? - Really fun. - Ready for the contest? - Yeah. Practice your snap off the lip? No, but she's perfect on the wipeouts. Guys, we're in church. She's going to do her mermaid thing and crush it like she always does. Almost got it. Darn it. Come on. Interesting technique, Noah. Is that how the professionals do it? Hey, I know what I'm doing. Okay. - Where you going? - To watch the competition. They gave me a five! Not so bad for a girl. What! Read it and weep, honey. I'm not the one who's going to be weeping. - Five! - Hey! Hey! Hey! - Don't harass the judges! - Hey! Hey! Hey! We're coming to get you! - Babe, is it your knee again? - Got you! Noah, put me down! Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the junior portion of the Maui Jim Turtle Bay Resort Invitational. We're expecting a great competition today. We've got skateboarding on the half-pipe. We've got all the action in the water. - Watch top amateur surf... - Hey, howzit? - Hey. - Hey, Keoki. If you get tired waiting for the waves out there, you can always come and kick it with us. We don't have to wait for the action. Well, when you get tired of the pipe, come surf some real waves. Hey, Thursday night is a full moon. If you guys aren't doing anything, we're all gonna go surfing. Yeah, if we don't have anything better to do. Okay. See you guys later. - All right. Bye. - Bye. In semi-final heat number one, we've got six competitors. In orange is Olivia Jenner. In black, Malina Birch. In blue, Bethany Hamilton. In yellow, Kaila Kahani. In white, Lalani Bri. And in pink, Alana Blanchard. And it looks like the local groms have tracked down Hawaiian surfing legend, Ben Aipa. Yeah, Ben! - Hey, you see that sick air Keoki just got? - I don't think so. - What? - You're not going to distract me. I'm catching that next wave. I don't think they know how not to compete. Holt, you didn't tell them, did you? No, no. I didn't want to make them nervous. I'm nervous enough for the both of them, as it is. You know, they both have to place. Black, Malina Birch, you're in first. Blue, Bethany Hamilton, you're in second Iooking for a 4.2 to overtake that top spot. Pink, Alana Blanchard, you're in third, requiring a 5.4 to overtake first place. Just a reminder, ladies and gentlemen. The winners of today's contest will qualify for the Hawaiian Island Regionals. Alana Blanchard finds the cover to finish things off. Solid wave for pink. Yes! Looks like we have a paddle-battle here. Go, Bethany! Go! It's blue and black scratching for a solid set wave. Malina Birch taking the inside off of Bethany Hamilton. Here she is, up and riding. Malina Birch kicks things off with a very nice ride. And a strong carve off the top. She definitely knows what the judges are looking for. That will be a solid wave for black. Malina full on stole my wave, I had position. It's okay, it's all right. Look, next time, I want you to really focus on just diving into the water as far as you can. - Rip that paddle back. Okay? - Okay. All right, take a rest. - You thirsty? - Yeah. With five minutes remaining in this final, pink, Alana Blanchard, you are in first. Black, Malina Birch, you are in second. And blue, Bethany Hamilton, you are currently in third. You're not breathing, you know that, right? Go! Go! Yeah! Big snap off the top. She draws out her second bottom turn, and hooks it one more time. Bethany Hamilton is holding nothing back. Potentially one of the highest scoring rides of the day. As this final comes to a close here at Turtle Bay. Yes! That's what I'm talking about. You're doing a great job training her, Brother Tom. - Thanks, Ben. - You got it, bro. Looks like she has a real future. As a pro. She's been working so hard. Well, with her heart, her will, she'll go far. Third place of the Turtle Bay Juniors final goes to Alana Blanchard. In second place, Malina Birch. Good job, Malina. Meaning, taking first place is Kauai's Bethany Hamilton. - Bethany! - With today's big victory, Bethany Hamilton has to be considered the favorite as we head to the Hawaiian Island Regionals. Way to go, Bethany. Girls, there's some people down there you might want to meet. - Who? - It's the guys from Rip Curl, it's no big deal. They want to sponsor both of you. - No way! - What! Oh, my gosh! I got it, how about this one? - Nice, if you're 100. - Okay. - What about this? - Are you kidding? Thing looks like a eye patch. I think it's hot. One wipeout in that tiny thing, and you're going to be showing a lot more than your sick rides. So much for so little. Well, good thing it's on Rip Curl. Yes! But make sure to keep your eye on it, ifyou don't want it snaked out from underneath you. Hey, girls. You realize I'm gonna take you next time, right? Let's just let the surfing do the talking. Every day between now and regionals, when I'm in the water training, I'll be thinking ofyou, Hamilton. Creepy. Thanks, but I think you should stick to your training. Seems like you could use a little focus. I guess we'll find out. Good seeing you again. You guys are usually the first ones in here, let's go. Let's finish up Rad Night with a game. Can anyone tell me what he or she thinks this is? - Easy, it's a dodge ball. - No. Or Mars? A blob in a lava lamp? Very creative, but no. - It's a fly's eye. - Weird. - How about this one? - A brain. Aren't brains supposed to be pink? A dead, rotting brain? That is gross, and that is a walnut. So, you see how hard it can be to make sense of things when you're looking at them really close? The same thing's true in life. So, ifyou guys are dealing with anything, that's just too hard to handle or doesn't seem to make much sense, get a new perspective. I want to share with you guys something that has really made an impact on my life. That's Jeremiah 29:11. ""For I know the plans that I have for you,"" says the Lord. ""Plans to prosper you and not to harm you. ""Plans to give you hope and a future."" That's all the time we have tonight, guys. If you are going on the mission trip, please don't forget to give me your permission slips. Hey, what's up? What's this? Well, it looks like I'm not going to be able to go to Mexico, so I brought some things for the orphanage. I made the bracelets. Noah donated the shoes and the Spam's from Timmy. Are you sure you can't come? Yeah, I've got to stay and train now that I'm sponsored. I was really looking forward to it. You're going to miss out. Well, have a good trip. Sarah's really bumming me out. Any particular reason? Yeah. So, I told her I'm not coming to Mexico. I mean, she knows that I have two important competitions coming up, right? I mean, she knows how much I've put into this, you know? How much you and the whole family has put into this. So what's her angle? That going to Mexico to help kids is really important. And I know it is. I mean, I really, really wish I could go. It's just, I've got to stay and train for regionals. Did you say you'd go? Well, yeah, but that was before I got sponsored. I mean, it's like she's counting on me now, Iike I'm the only person in the entire world who can do this. I mean, I'm not going. I mean, I can't, right? It's your call. Great. Now I feel even worse. That's good. A small step in a good direction. The girls are all tucked in. - How's it look tomorrow? - Pretty decent, actually. - Well. - No, no, no, you can't. What? You have your surgery tomorrow. The doctor said no food after 10:00. This is like juice. - Give it to me. - No. No, no. - Give it. - No. - Give it. Give it. - No. You need to relax, they'll never know the difference. Maybe we shouldn't. I mean, we have to get up super early for dawn patrol. - I mean, what happens if my mom comes in? - Bethany, it'll be worth it. The moon's full. The waves are perfect. I mean, come on, it's almost Halloween. Even Noah's done it. - He has? - Yeah. - I really wanted to go. - Okay, come on, let's go. - Keoki. - I knew it was you! No way! Yeah, you surf like a skater. Hey! You're toast, Keoki. - Okay, truce. Truce. - Okay, deal. Bethy, it's almost midnight. - What happens at midnight? - You'll see. What? Later skater. How lucky are we? Awesome! Good morning. - Morning. - Morning. So, as soon as you girls get back from the water, I've got an English assignment all ready for you. But it's a holiday. It's Halloween. We were thinking that we could have a couple extra hours on the waves today? 'Cause you didn't get enough last night? Just say the word and we can enroll you girls in Kapa'a, where you can ride the bus for minutes each way and do eight hours of straight work during prime surf hours. 'Cause I'm all right with that. Actually, I love home school. Me, too. Adore, totally. I'm really sorry, Mom. It's just... I really, really wanted to go night surfing. I mean, everyone talks about how awesome it is. - I mean, even Noah's done it. - He has? Good job. - Why didn't you just ask? - Because she knew you'd say no. How do you know I'd say no? - Would you have let me go? - No. I don't know. Hey, no, no, no, no. I promise I'll ask next time, okay? I'm going to hold you to that. Dad, you should have them upgrade you to a bionic knee so you can actually beat Mom in surfing. It's going to take a lot more than a bionic knee. You just wait. You sure you don't want me to drive you? Mom, I got it. When you come through it, I will be waiting. That's your dad, Alana. Have fun girls. Bye. Bye, Dad. Say hi to Dr. Rovinsky for me. Have a good surgery, I'll be praying. Rip it up. See you on the flip side. This is a good one. This is a good song. That looks good, doesn't it? - All right, we're here. Let's hit it. - Let's get out. Let's do it. Sweet. I've got a meeting at 10:00, so we don't have a lot of time today. No problem. Just pick us up after your meeting. Yeah. Like that's going to happen. Let's just get in the water already. Come on, it's a long paddle around the reef. Try and keep up with us. Well, the anesthetic should have started working by now. - You feel anything? - A little bit. All right, it will kick in shortly. We'll have you back out there shredding waves with Bethany in no time. Thanks, David. Yeah! Did you see that one? - That was nice off the lip, buddy. - Thanks. I wonder what bathing suit I should wear to the shoot. The pink's cute, but the black really works with my tan. I don't think you get to decide. They'll probably just tell us what to wear. I guess, but it's fun to think about. Can you believe we get to come out here every day? Yeah. - Dad! - Alana! Shark! I need to get to the beach. Oh, God! Dad, where's the shark at? We need to get to the reef! Just get to the reef. Keep on the board, keep on the board. Byron, you get to shore! Go! Go! Call 911! It's going to be okay, Beth. I'll start it for you! Come on. Ready, pal? Let's go. Push, push, push. Stay with us, sweetie, okay? Stay with us. Please, Jesus. Please... - Alana, you keep her on the board. - Okay. - On the board. - Please get me to the beach. Please. You're going to be okay! Come on! All right, here we go. Doctor Rovinsky, we need this room stat! It's a teenage girl from the North Shore. Shark attack. Who? Who is it? I'll check it out, Tom. I'll check it out. Stay with me, Bethany! - Alana! Get over here! - I can't. Morning, Mom. When did you go night surfing? Night surfing... All right. All right, sweetheart. - Ambulance is coming, all right? - I want my mom. I know. We're gonna get your mom. We're gonna get your mom. Wait, wait, wait. What? Mom? - Dad! I called 911! I called her mom. - Okay, okay, okay. Grab the foot of the board. Okay? Grab it, on the count of three. Ready? One, two, three! Go, go, go, go, go! Take her up to the truck! Let's get her up there right now! Come on. Talk to me. Watch your step right here! What your step right there! Where's the ambulance, Dad? They're not here yet! Don't worry about the ambulance! We'll meet it on the way! Alana, get the board! Get her up! All right. Get up, get up there! - Bethany, can you hear me? Oh, my God. - She's losing a lot of blood, Dad! All right, I see the ambulance. Here it comes! - Who are you, sir? - Family friend. Do you know if she hit her head or ever lost consciousness? No, she never passed out, but she's lost a lot of blood. Here we go! Careful! Easy. - Okay, lock her in. - Please don't die. Come on, come on, come on, sweetie. Please don't take her! Please don't take her. Please don't take her. Tom, it's Bethany. - No, no! No! - Get me out of here! - Get me out of here! - No. Come on. You can't move! - Just let me get out of here! - You can't walk! - Get me out of here! - No! Talk to me. Gotta stay with me. Keep looking at my eyes, okay? Where's my family? They're on their way. They're gonna meet us at the hospital. - She's going into hypovolemic shock. - We're almost there. Breathe deep. Mom, the car! Stay with me. Cheri, it happened so fast... - Traumatic amputation. Severe loss of blood. - I'm here, baby, I'm right here. - Blood pressure over and dropping. - I'm right here. Up, up! Get her in here. Move! Come on! Follow it back. - Let's go! Stay with us! - Hang in there. Bethany, you'll be okay! What's happening? - Get her in a bed. - Move her into bay three! Come on, Bethany. Stay with us, stay with us. - What's happening? - Bethany! Mom? Hi, sweetheart. I'm right here. Hey. We're all here. It hurts. Okay. - Noah, get the doctor. - Yeah, I got it. I'm a little thirsty. - Okay. - Got it. Dad, please don't cry. I'm not crying. I'm going to be okay. I know. Hey there, kiddo. How you holding up? Pretty good, thanks to you. I guess I ruined your surf shirt, huh? Well, I never liked that one anyway. Why don't you just concentrate on getting better, okay? Thank you. You were amazing out there. You were the one who kept me calm. You never... You never let go. You are incredibly brave, Bethany. Where's Alana? She's... She's at home. With her mother. She's... She's still a little freaked out. But, you know, she'll be better knowing that you're going to be okay. So... Hey. How's my favorite patient? You say that to everyone. I mean it when I see you. I'll wait outside. I'll see you later. So, I understand you're feeling some discomfort. - Yeah. - Well, that's normal. There's going to be a lot of pain because of the trauma that you endured. Not to mention the fact that you've lost over  of your blood. You're going to be feeling kind of lousy for the next few days, kid. Now here's the thing, Bethany. The things that you're going to have to learn to do differently is extensive. But the good news. Those things you're not gonna be able to do is small. I'm so proud of you. I'll tell you something. She is a living miracle. Thanks, David. - Hey, sleepy head. - Hi. How you feeling? I've been better. When can I surf again? Are you busy right now? Kind of. Soon. How do you know? Because you can do all things... - Through him who gives me strength. - ...through him who gives me strength. Noah, eat your food. It's gross. I'm not hungry. Eat it. Mine's fine. I said, I'm not hungry. Well, if you didn't want it, why'd you let me pay for it then? Fine. I'll pay you back. I think you two should calm down. I am calm. - We're not doing this. - Doing what? Life's got to go on - the way it's always gone on. - What you talking about? Life is not going to go on the way it has always gone on. - Will you stop arguing? - No, he's arguing with me. - Everyone's yelling at everyone. - Stop it. Stop it! Hey, sweetheart. It's a dream, okay? Just a dream, that's all. Just a dream. It wasn't a dream! It was real. You should go see her. You know that? You need to go see her. ...was resting on her surfboard in the ocean off Hawaii, when, suddenly, a shark bites off her arm. The girl doesn't even scream, and her composure may have saved her life. You're pretty much on every channel. Hey! - Where have you been? - You know, at home, living it up. How have you been? I thought you were going to die out there. So, are you still going to do that Rip Curl photo shoot? They wanted me to. But I told them I couldn't do it without you. But that's crazy. You've been nuts for that shoot. You have to do it. - Really? - Yeah. Of course. Do it for both of us. You're not going to believe how great the house smells. Plants are everywhere. More flowers have been delivered than there are growing on the entire island. Dr. Rovinsky said that I can get back in the water as soon as my stitches come out. Can we try a shower first? - That's so cool. Who did that? - Everybody. The bite on Bethany Hamilton's surfboard was inches long and inches wide. ...currently searching for a shark believed to be responsible for the attack on Bethany Hamilton. It's okay. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Get out of here! Where's Dad? Bethany! I said leave! Noah! Noah! - Just get back in the house. - Dad... Unlock the back door. - Bethany, is this... - Come on, get out of my way! Excuse me! Pardon me! Excuse me! Excuse me. - I've got it from here, honey. Scoot over. - What are you gonna do? Nice driving, 007. You know what? I never liked those bushes anyway, Dad. Come on, Bethany, I got you. - Give me your bag. - I didn't know you could drive like that. Neither did l. So what do we do now? Remember when we brought Noah home from the hospital? He was our first baby and we had no clue what to do. It's the same thing. We'll take it day by day. - That's so messed up. - I wish they would go away. Ginger! Hi, girl! I know, I know, I know. I know. It's still me. Ginger! Who's up for sandwiches? Sounds so good, I'm starving. - Noah? - Yeah, sure. Okay, where's my Spam? - Mexico. - All of it? I got it. I got it, sweetie. - Sorry, Mom. - It's okay. - Here, let me grab that. - You want to get some bread, love? Yeah. - I need to go unpack. - Are you sure? I have some good news to share. What news? Holt got a call from that show, Inside Edition, and they want to give Bethany a prosthetic arm. Wait, wait, wait. She's been home for five minutes. - They're gonna pay for the entire thing. - When did you talk to a TV show? And it's custom made. Will it look normal? - I would think so. - Awesome. Can they make one I can surf with? What does she have to do? All she has to do is give a brief interview, wearing the arm. Check out my sister the celebrity. - You don't have to do this. - No. I want to. Yeah, yeah, I'll do it. So, it's settled. Hey, wait. Let's give thanks. That arm could not come soon enough. Because trying to make do with only one, even harder than it sounds. I mean, fixing your hair is not exactly rocket science. Unless you've only got one arm. Then it might as well be a mission to Mars. Every day of my life, for as far back as I could remember, I was in the water. And now, I couldn't even put my bathing suit on. Almost everything seemed to be a challenge. But what scared me most, was that I might not be able to surf again. It's so sad. Mommy, what happened to that girl's arm? I'm sorry. Should I go? Or do you want to do this together? It's up to you. Stay. Okay. It's looking great. It's healing nicely. You all right? There you go. It's going to look better once the stitches are out. Is she okay? You okay? Hey! I just got back from Mexico. I'm so glad you're okay. I was just about to come see you. I couldn't wait. Come here. I was thinking about you, and praying for you every minute. How are you? I'm good. Yeah. Everyone's been doing really good. You don't have to do that, Bethany. Not with me. They're trying to help. I know. I know. But... But what? You know how you said it's hard to see things clearly sometimes when you're too close? Well, I've been trying to get some perspective. I've been really trying. Sarah, how can this be God's plan for me? I don't understand. I don't know why terrible things happen to us sometimes. But I have to believe that something good is going to come out of this. - Okay. - I don't know what that is. I really wish I did. Come here. Hello? Dad. Excuse us. That's a perfect fit, bro. Come on, Dad. Hey, Alana, can you take a little half step forward? Put your hand a little higher on the board. That is gorgeous. Perfect. Beautiful. You're natural born for this. Gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous. Actually, Alana, go take a break, come back, grab a new bikini, that'd be perfect. - So? How did I look? - Great. Not too cheesy, right? Somewhere between cheddar and jalapeno jack. Thank you. - That guy's ripping it up out there, yeah? - Yeah. Hey, Alana, we're ready for you over here! You know, you should be doing this with me. - No. - You should. Go on, they're waiting for you. Don't worry about me. She's right, you should listen to her. Yeah, and you should stop listening to other people's conversations, you kook. Just got your back. - Loser. - Poser. You should be out there with her, though. Yeah, I should be with her. Just not there. What's taking so long? So what's for breakfast? Wouldn't you like to know? - Yeah, we would. We're hungry! - Yes! - Okay. - What's the occasion? Does there have to be an occasion for me to make my family fresh squeezed orange juice and homemade banana bread? You do realize that tomorrow is Thanksgiving, not today, right? Yeah. That's why it's the perfect time. Perfect time for what? To get back in the water. Aren't you afraid? I'm more afraid of not surfing. All right, get out there and have some fun! Come on. Come on, let's go already! Are you ready? If she is, I am. - Grab my ankle, I'll tow you out. - No, I'm good. There you go! Just take it nice and easy, Bethany. Hey, don't worry about it. It was a junk wave anyway. Yeah, I'll get the next one. Why don't you just paddle today? No. - We can come back tomorrow. - No, I'm good. Try putting your hand in the center of the board, along the stringer so you don't tip over. Be patient, honey. Yes! - Look at that! - Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! That's the way to go, honey! Got it all on camera. - Training starts tomorrow. - Training for what? The Hawaiian lsland Regionals. Excuse me! Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. - Happy Thanksgiving! - Thanks so much for coming. And if you don't mind, I'd like to offer up a little toast. Sweetheart. We are so blessed and thankful to God for all ofyou because ofyour love and your support over the past few weeks. And we are especially thankful to be spending yet another Thanksgiving with our sweet, beloved daughter. Here's to Bethany! To Bethany! - That was embarrassing. - I thought it was wonderful. - Hey! - Hey! - I heard you're back in the water. - I know, and there's something else. Oh, yeah? I'm surfing the Hawaiian lsland Regionals. - Are you kidding me? - No! Oh, my gosh, that's so amazing! - Bethany, I am so proud of you! - Thanks. Well, you really outdid yourself again this year, Cheri. - I helped. - He tasted everything. Yeah, one of my many talents. Like clearing the table. - Let me help you. - Thank you. I realize this would be a very different day without you. You know, I just wish I could have done more. Our family is a family because ofyou. We have made this to your exact specifications. Doesn't it look real? Yeah. That's kind of weird how real it looks. And you can even paint the fingernails. Shall we try it on? Now, you just take that strap, and I'll take this one. Hold tight. There, how does that feel? It's okay. Let me just see how it works on my board. Not weight bearing. How am I supposed to use it to push up on my board? I think you might have to do that with the other arm. So, is there a way I can grab the rails to duck dive? Honey, why don't you just give it a chance? How am I supposed to paddle and surf in this thing? I mean, look at it! Yeah. Because the remainder ofyour arm is so short, mobility will be limited. - But there's so much more you can do... - Can I take it off, please? - Every single thing... - Take it off. She said she wants you to take it off. You can turn that off. Hey! No! Hey! Don't! Hey! Drop it! - Ginger! - Drop it! Ginger, stop! - Drop it! - No. Release! Honey, you can still surf without it. - Let it go! - Ginger! - Bad dog! - Ginger! Bad dog! I like her better that way. Dad was right. I don't need it to surf. No, you don't. Would it be better to just say it out loud? I thought... I thought at least with clothes on, I could have two arms. Thought I could look normal. Normal is so overrated. But people like normal, Mom. - Who? - Guys do. I mean, who will even like me with this? The right guy will love you exactly the way you are. Because you're beautiful. How do you know? Because I know. What's that worth, right? Nothing. What are you doing? We had this statue in my house, when I was a little girl. It was a replica from a museum my parents once went to. I didn't even think about it until just now. Venus de Milo. For centuries, all around the world, she was considered the pinnacle of beauty. And she has one less arm than you. Yeah, but I can surf. So, regionals. What we have to do is to get you from here to here. It's not going to be easy. I don't need easy, I just need possible. With you, anything's possible. Let's do it. - Right there. - On the take off. - Right there. Now, look. A little back step. - Yeah. - That could be a sign... - 'Cause that time I wiped out. Just a hair late when you take off. So, I'll just adjust my body so that my weight is even more... - Or bring your arm all the way around. - Yes. - Look at her. - That's it. That's it, right there! - That is perfect. - Okay. - That's what you want to go for every time. - Yup. How'd you feel out there this morning? Pretty good. I mean, I have a little trouble getting under the big waves, but once I'm up, I'm solid. I'll come in if I can't handle it, okay? - Good morning. I'm Piper Borraow. - And I'm Rob Bucannan. And we'd like to welcome you to the Hawaiian Island Regionals. - How do you feel? - Like barfing. Yeah, well, aim for Malina. If you don't want to do this, you don't have to. I'm not going to pull out now. Besides everyone knows I've entered. It's now or never. Soledad O'Brian is in Phuket, Thailand. She has been following efforts by some survivors to find their missing loved ones. Hey, Bethany. Good luck out there today, yeah. Thanks. Man, that's really awful. Clearly, wherever you look along the path of this tsunami there is just stories of loss, and thousands already... I hope you guys get a lot of donations. Yeah, Sarah's organizing a trip to help the kids in Thailand. My heat's coming up, I gotta go. Bye. Great to have you back, Bethany. Thanks, it's good to be back. So you're actually going through with this? Yeah. - Hey, Bethany. - Hey. Judges have approved giving you a five minute head start. - I don't want it. - Bethany. I don't need it. Okay. Come on, Bethany. First heat has started and the girls are making their way out into the lineup. All right, we've got Bethany Hamilton in the blue jersey trying to catch her first wave. See ya! Bethany unable to get into that wave. Meanwhile, Malina Birch scratches into one. Looks like a good one. All right, Malina Birch dropped in on that inside roll, nice bottom turn. Off the bottom, coming up. Comes around the corner, gets a nice vertical off the top there as she kicks out to the challengers. Hamilton drops into a nice looking wave. A little loss of control there. But nice recovery. She cuts back into the white water. Should be a decent scoring ride for the surfer in blue. All right, Alana Blanchard, drops into a wave of her own, nice off the bottom, big snap off the top. Sets up again for a nice cut back into the white water. Speeding down the line Iooking for a little tube section, gets in there. Threads that little barrel and exits. Nice wave for Alana Blanchard. All right, Rockwell, it looks like at the ten minute mark we have Malina Birch in first with a 7. on her first ride. Alana Blanchard is second with a 6. 2. And in third place, Leila Hurst with a 5. 3. The surf is picking up. Whoa, look at that outside, a big set approaching. It looks like Bethany Hamilton is going to get caught inside of the biggest wave of the day. Come on, Bethany. Come on! Mountains of water rolling through here at Sunset Beach and it looks like our competitor in blue, Bethany Hamilton, just taking some donuts out there. No! I'm fine! I knew she wouldn't come in. Bethany, grab my leash, I'll pull you the rest of the way out. No, I'm fine. I can do this! Come on, Bethany! All right, four minutes left, and Bethany Hamilton still stuck in the impact zone, Rob. Bethany, in sixth place, right now. She's still needing quite a score. She's okay. Malina, don't! You have enough, let her have it! Alana Blanchard just dropped in on Malina Birch. That's definitely going to be an interference call on Blanchard. Alana Blanchard will not make it on this heat, has been disqualified for the interference. I can't take it anymore, I want you to get her out of there. - I want her out of there. - The lifeguards are on it. Oh, man, it looks like she broke her board. Well, unfortunately for Bethany Hamilton, a broken board right now, puts her in a bad position, with only minutes remaining, there's no chance she's making it out of this first heat. You shouldn't have dropped in on Malina like that. - She was trying... - She was just hassling me, - like she always does. - She's a jerk! At least she was treating me like I was real competition. Bethany, what happened to you out there? Bethany. Can we please just get out of here? Make a path! Get out of the way! - Stay calm. - Bethany, how are you feeling? That's enough, come on. Bethany, I know that you got beat up pretty bad out there today, sweetheart. But you can't let it get you down. Enough, Dad, okay? I can't do this anymore! - Yes, you can, honey. - Listen to her. Bethany! Bethany! Bethany! Hey, Bethany! Can I get your autograph? I have something even better actually. Here. Cool! Bethany, what are you doing? Oh, my God! This is so cool! - Awesome, thanks! - Enjoy them. Bethany. Dad, just stop. Okay? It's over. That's not what I'm saying. You can't give up on her. And you can't keep pushing at her. What are you supposed to do, just let her quit? If she wants to, yes. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Then you're not hearing what I'm saying. What? What is it that I'm not hearing? You can't always fix everything by sheer will. Sometimes there is no... ...Hamilton has to be considered the favorite as we head to the Hawaiian Island Regionals. She's a surfer. - She's a competitor. - She's more than that. Cheri, if she walks away from this... If she quits, she may never get back in the water again. And she will never be the same. She will never be the same. And if she thinks the only life out there for her is surfing and she can't make that happen then she's going to be lost. Really, really lost. Go ahead, tell me how everything's going to be okay. Yeah, that's me. Mister jump-right-in-and-fix-it. If I could just keep my mouth shut for once. I'm done, aren't l? I can't even paddle out to the lineup past the big waves. I don't understand. What happened to ""l can do all things""? Why? Why did this happen? Why did I have to lose everything? You didn't lose everything, Bethany. Not even close. That shark didn't kill you. You're still here. You're still alive. With a family that loves you. What am I supposed to do now? I don't know. Then how am I supposed to know? When the time is right, you'll know. Until then, you pray and you listen. Listen for what? For what comes next. Okay, Lymar, I hope you remembered your toothbrush this time. Okay? Did you remember your socks? Because you are not borrowing mine again. Could you pass these out? Bethany? Mind if I tag along? I'm sure we can scrounge up something for you to do. Hey. All right, guys, let's go! Rosemary! Sarah! Hey, thank you for coming. This is Bethany. Bethany, yeah, I've heard a lot about you. I'm happy you're here. Grab some bags and pass them out. All right, everybody make a line. Just grab it and pass it down. Come on. - Keep it going! - Come on guys. - Keep going. - Make a line. Got it? Good job. She wants to thank you all for what you've been doing. They're very grateful. We're so happy we can help, we know they've been through so much. She says it was just a normal day like any other. But that they saw the water roll back and they went to get the fish and the lobsters. But then they saw the wave and it was too late. And the water just kept coming, there weren't many survivors. I lost my family. Another family, they all died... I'm so sad. You okay? Yeah. It's all right, don't be sorry for compassion, Bethany. It can move us to do amazing things. And it can help you get a new perspective. Why don't you take a minute, then when you're feeling better, come back and join us. 'Cause there's a lot to do. Okay? Good. Here you go. Hello. Here you go. How come no one's in the water? We brought all these boards. Still petrified. - ls it safe? - Yeah. Something's missing, yeah? They said he wandered up a few days after the tsunami. - What's his name? - They don't know. He hasn't said a word, he won't even smile. Hey, do you want to go in the water? Do you want to go out to the ocean and go swimming? No? - Hey, can I borrow your board? - Yeah. Thank you. Thanks. They say the Lord works in mysterious ways. I say that's an understatement. Who would have thought that teaching a kid to surf would teach me that surfing isn't the most important thing in the world? And that something else is. Love. Bigger than any tidal wave. More powerful than any fear. Hey, I'm home! Hey, there she is. - How was your trip? - Great. What's all this stuff? Oh, you know, just a little fan mail. Went ahead and sorted it out by country. - Are you serious? - Yup. And apparently, you are very popular in Madagascar. No way. ""Dear Bethany. My name is Stephanie Bolt, ""I'm years old and I go to Northcross lntermediate School in New Zealand."" People are so amazing. There's an eighth grader from North Carolina, who lost his arm. Logan, and he says he's gonna try out for his school soccer team because of me. And he's rooting for me in my next competition. I mean, I don't understand, I totally blew it at regionals. Why would they want me to compete? You tried. And apparently, Dylan and Stephanie like that. Hey, Dad. I need your help. - Name it. - I think I want to compete. You sure? You don't have to. I'll take it heat by heat. Okay. So we need to figure out something. Some way so when I duck dive, I don't get pounded. Yeah. You mean something like this? Yeah. You sure she can use it in competition? Sure. Judges don't score on how you get out to the waves. They only care what you do when you catch one. Go ahead, say it. I'm a genius. - You are... - Come on, say it. Tom, you're a genius! - Genius. - You're very smart. Genius. Come on, you know it. - You're cute. You're very cute. - Genius. Genius. - Hey. - Hey. - Remember me? - No. That's really nice. Best friends since birth, nothing. - No. Nothing. - Good. Good sign. Hey, thanks for coming. Thanks for calling. - I'm sorry I snapped at you at regionals. - Me, too. - I miss you. - Me, too. - Friends? - Of course. Hey, Bethany! I saw you surfing out there this morning. You were amazing. - Maybe for a girl with one arm. - By any standard. As for one arm, that just levels the playing field. All right, all right. What do you want? I want you to dominate at nationals. Hey, Keoki, thanks. For what? Just for always showing up for me, no matter what. Well, it's because I care about you. I mean, even if you did miss my last competition and all. - I was in the hospital you psycho. - Excuses, excuses. - Bethany, I'm sorry. I wasn't even... - Gotcha. Sucker! Welcome to the Rip Curl Junior Nationals Surfing Championship. David Stanfield along with Bo Hodge. And, Bo, we have an exciting day today. We've got an excellent day of surfing on hand. We're going to see the best amateur surfers from around the country today. We have a panel of four international judges watching this national championship. High and low scores are thrown out, but what are the judges exactly looking for? Well, Dave, we have 25-minute heats. Each rider is allowed to catch a maximum of waves per heat. The best two waves will be tallied up for the final score. What the judges are looking for;. style, flow and power and control in radical maneuvers in the most critical sections of the wave. Well, we have surf in the six-to-eight-foot range, it looks like out there. What's key about this six person heat is in fact that paddling and positioning, right? These girls are tough, especially Malina, you know that. The surf is big out there today, so if you try to match them wave for wave, you're just doing to wear yourself out with all that paddling. Yeah. So don't take just any wave that comes along. The greatest surfers, they all have this sixth sense. They know when the best waves are coming. They can feel it. It's a gift. You have that gift, too. I do? Well, your mom's right, honey. You are a little mermaid. You know that moment between the sets when it's quiet and the waves haven't even formed yet, it's just energy surging through the water. Well, that's the time to be patient. Listen to your instinct. Trust it. You'll know. Go get 'em. Malina! Malina! Over the past few months, Malina Birch has dominated every heat she's surfed winning three contests in a row. No one has come close. She's by far the person to beat today. Bethany! Bethany! Don't worry, it's all part of being sponsored. We love you, Bethany! I'm going to go get the rash guards. What are you doing here? I'm surfing, same as you. Well, I hope you don't need to be rescued again. Actually, Malina, I wanted to thank you. For what? Just for never taking it easy on me. It means a lot. You ready? Okay. Bethany Hamilton's appearance here is truly a remarkable comeback. Against all odds, she has earned her spot into the National Championships. Everyone in attendance is hopeful that Bethany has a great contest. But at the highest level of competition, there are no free rides. We begin with our first round of competition. And there's the horn. The first heat is underway. Yes! Yes! Can you believe that? Advancing into the finals by 210's of a point, the big story is Bethany Hamilton. She was looking for a 7. and scored a 7.4 on her last wave. She'll be wearing blue out in the lineup with her good friend, wearing pink, Alana Blanchard. And their competitors, black, Malina Birch. Yellow, Leila Hurst. White, Nage Melamed, and in orange Kelia Moniz. And the judges are looking for some progressive surfing today. That's right, Dave. They'll have a 25-minute heat, be scored on waves, but they'll keep their best two waves for the final score on the zero to ten point range. And there's the horn and the heat is underway. Yeah! There's Nage Melamed. She scores two vertical turns, and the judges give her a 6. 75, and what a great start to this heat. Alana Blanchard picking up a set wave. Works her way down the line. Snaps a big turn off the top. Runs around her competitor with an aggressive reentry. And pink cracks the lip one more time. Great run, Alana! Situation with fifteen minutes remaining in the heat, surfer in orange, Kelia Moniz, you have a 5.4. Surfer in white, Nage Melamed, you have a 6. 75. Surfer in pink, Alana Blanchard, you are in first place with a 7. 0. Way to go, Alana! Go! Bo, Hamilton goes down hard in the impact zone, and she is struggling. That's okay. You'll get another one! Stay in there, stay in there, Bethany. Take a look at this. We've got four competitors scratching for this wave. And surfer in black takes control of the peak. Birch on the nice take off. She sprays Bethany! Great off the top! Birch snaps under the lip. Banks it off the white water one more time. Man, she is on fire today. One away. Malina Birch has scored a 9. according to the judges, and that is a high score. Now she is in the lead, Blanchard in second. Melamed in third, Leila Hurst in fourth, Bethany Hamilton is in fifth, and in sixth right now is Moniz. Hamilton with a stall and goes over the falls. Is she going to be all right? It's okay. Everybody gets caught every once in a while. She can handle it. Precious time on the clock right now, Dave. And it looks like Alana is paddling into a big wave on the outside. And Alana Blanchard takes a spill there, too. Ladies and gentlemen, Malina Birch is up and riding again. This girl's a wave magnet today, Bo. She certainly is in rhythm with the ocean. Way above the pack here in today's competition. Malina Birch has just scored a 9. on her last wave. That is the highest wave of the contest. She's going to need two nine-plus waves to even come close to catching Malina. She's got less than five minutes. With time winding down and no waves on the horizon, our surfers are anxious to get a final score. Look for the girls to scramble for any solid wave before the hooter blows. Check this out, ladies and gentlemen. There's some energy out in back. Looks like the girls have spotted something on the horizon. Paddle, Bethany. Paddle hard. Bo, take a look at this. Birch and Hamilton paddle-battle out the back. And Hamilton really needs to beat her to the inside. - If she's got a chance here today. - Come on, Bethany, stay ahead of her! Don't let up! You got her! Unbelievable, Bo, all Malina's got to do is block Bethany Hamilton from getting to the inside and she's got this contest in the bag. Paddle hard! Birch is still blocking Hamilton from the inside. I don't know how she's going to catch this wave, Bo. Paddle! Dave, we've got a paddle-battle to the outside. It's Birch. It's Hamilton. She's got her on the ropes. Can Bethany catch the wave? This is her last chance. - Yes! - Yes! She's got the wave, David! This is the one she's been waiting for all contest long. Absolutely unbelievable. Bethany Hamilton duck dives under Malina Birch while Birch is still out there looking for another ride. Sick one, Bethany! That was an unbelievable ride by Bethany Hamilton. The judges give her a 9. 7. It's the highest score of the heat! - But she's still fifth! - All right, guys, she needs one more, one more. Bethany Hamilton is paddling outside the lineup. What does she see? I don't know, Dave, but no one's been paddling out in that area all during the contest. Why is she so far out? What, is she giving up? I don't know. She feels something. What are you doing? Dave, there's only one minute remaining on the clock. It is dead flat. The contest may be already over. Why is she stopping? - There's nothing out there. - Not yet. Only seconds on the clock and no set waves on the horizon. This contest may be over, Bo. We are counting down to end this final. Just seconds left on the clock. Big bomb on the outside. Fifteen seconds remaining. Everybody else is too far inside. The Rip Curl Nationals, seconds to go! And there is Bethany Hamilton with an amazing wave out the back. Will this be enough? She is paddling and here comes the wave. She's taken the drop! An amazing barrel for Bethany Hamilton. Perfect positioning. Was she up before the horn? They have to count it. Way to go, Bethany! Yeah! Unbelievable. Bethany Hamilton's amazing wave at the end does not count. - She stood up after the horn. - What? So she gets no score. Malina Birch, your new National Champion. No! It's okay, Dad. It's okay. But it didn't count. It counted. It totally counted. Yes, it did. I'm still checking that video. Noah! Hey. You okay? - Very. Are you? - Yeah. Yeah, I think so. What am I supposed to do now? You're supposed to enjoy it. All of it. For the rest of your life. - In fifth place, Bethany Hamilton! - Good job. Yeah! Bethany! And in fourth place, Leila Hurst. Third place, Nage Melamed. - Second place, Alana Blanchard. - Way to go, baby! And in first place, Malina Birch. Hey. Hey, Malina. Great job. You're a tough opponent. Bethany Hamilton, nobody is as tough as you. Get up here. Come on. Come on. I'd like to share this win with Bethany Hamilton. Because the judges may not have counted that last wave, but I did. Bethany. - Bethany! Bethany! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just back off, okay. - It's okay. - Are you sure? You don't have to talk to them. Yeah, but what about Dylan or Logan or Stephanie? What if they're watching? Bethany, I'm from Transworld Surf magazine. Are you upset you didn't win today? I didn't come to win. I came to surf. Bethany, I just wanted to ask you if you could go back to that day and not have gone surfing, would you do it? I wouldn't change what happened to me, because then I wouldn't have this chance in front of all of you. This chance to embrace more people than I ever could have with two arms. I was born to surf. This is why I wake up at the crack of dawn every day. This is why I endure belly rashes, reef cuts, muscles so tired they feel like noodles. And I've learned that life is a lot like surfing. When you get caught in the impact zone, you need to get right back up because you never know what's over the next wave. And if you have faith, anything is possible. Anything at all. Yeah, it was so much fun just seeing him get better and better on every wave and get up and ride all the way to the beach. It was awesome. Throwing out the ceremonial first pitch of the season is Bethany Hamilton. Strike. Thank you, Bethany! I think I got my courage from Jesus Christ. He says, ""Be strong."" You think you're going to surf again? I think? I know I'm going to surf again."
54,2000,Gladiator,American,"In AD 180, Hispano-Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return to his home after he leads the Roman army to victory against the Germanic tribes near Vindobona on the Limes Germanicus. Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that his own son, Commodus, is unfit to rule and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to help save Rome from corruption. Commodus murders his father when he is told about the plan.
Commodus announces he is the new Emperor and asks Maximus for his loyalty, but the general refuses. Maximus is arrested by guards and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and rides for his home near Trujillo, where he finds his family murdered. Maximus buries his wife and son; then collapses. He is found by slavers who take him to the Roman province of Zucchabar, where he is sold to a gladiator trainer named Proximo.
Although reluctant at first, Maximus fights in local tournaments and makes friends with two other gladiators: Juba, a Numidian; and Hagen, a German. His military skills help him win matches and gain recognition from other gladiators and the crowd. Proximo reveals that he was once a gladiator, and advises Maximus that he must ""win the crowd"" to win his freedom. Proximo takes his gladiators to fight in Rome's Colosseum, because Commodus has organized 150 days of games.
Disguised by a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in gladiatorial combat in the Colosseum as a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle of Zama. Unexpectedly, Maximus leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to show himself and give his name; Maximus reveals himself and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let the gladiators live, and the Praetorian Guard is held back from striking them down.
Maximus's next fight is a victory against a legendary undefeated gladiator. Commodus orders Maximus to kill the gladiator, but Maximus spares his opponent's life; he is called ""Maximus the Merciful"" by the crowd. Angered at this outcome, Commodus taunts Maximus about his family's deaths, but Maximus turns and walks away.
Maximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. Lucilla, Commodus's sister; Gracchus, an influential senator; and Maximus meet secretly. Maximus will escape Rome, join his soldiers, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate. Commodus learns of the plot by threatening Lucilla, and has the Praetorian Guard arrest Gracchus and attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where Cicero is killed.
Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus before the match to gain an advantage. Maximus disarms Commodus, whom the Praetorian Guard refuse to aid. Commodus then produces a hidden knife, which Maximus drives into his throat, killing him. Maximus succumbs to his wound. Before he dies, he asks for political reforms, for his gladiator allies to be freed, and for Senator Gracchus to be reinstated. Maximus's friends and allies honor him as ""a soldier of Rome"", at Lucilla's behest, and carry his body out of the arena, leaving the dead Commodus behind.
Juba visits the Colosseum at night and buries the figurines of Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died. Juba says he is to return to his own family and promises to see Maximus again, ""but not yet"".",8.5,tt0172495,"Sir. General. Sir. Lean and hungry. - Still nothing? - Not a sign. How long has he been gone? Nearly two hours. Will they fight, sir? We shall know soon enough. Soldier, I ordered you to move those catapults forward. - They're out of range. - Range is good. - The danger to the cavalry... - Is acceptable. Agreed? They say no. People should know when they're conquered. Would you, Quintus? Would I? Strength and honor. At my signal, unleash hell. Load the catapults. Infantry form up for advance. Archers ready. Archers! Nock! Fratres! Maximus! Three weeks from now, I will be harvesting my crops. Imagine where you will be, and it will be so. Hold the line! Stay with me! If you find yourself alone... riding in green fields with the sun on your face... do not be troubled. For you are in Elysium, and you're already dead! Brothers... what we do in life... echoes in eternity. Pull! Catapults ready, sir! Archers, ignite! Ignite! Archers, draw! Loose! All right, men, ready! Hold the line! Loose! Reload! Hold the line! - Draw! - Loose! Stay with me! Stay with me! Roma victor! Roma victor! Do you think he's really dying? He's been dying for years. If he weren't really dying, he wouldn't have sent for us. Maybe he just misses us. And the senators? He wouldn't have summoned them if... Peace, Commodus. After two weeks on the road, your incessant scheming is hurting my head. He's made his decision. He's going to announce it. He will name me. The first thing I shall do when... Is honor him with games worthy of His Majesty. For now, the first thing I shall do is have a hot bath. Your Highness? We seem to be almost there, sire. Sire. Where's the Emperor? He's at the front, sire. They've been gone for days. The wounded are still coming in. My horse. My lord. Kiss? You have proved your valor yet again, Maximus. Let us hope, for the last time. There's no one left to fight, sire. There is always someone left to fight. How can I reward Rome's greatest general? Let me go home. Home. They honor you, Caesar. It's for you, Maximus. They honor you. Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle? You have missed the war. Father, congratulations. I shall sacrifice bulls to honor your triumph. Save the bulls. Honor Maximus. He won the battle. General. Highness. Rome salutes you, and I embrace you as a brother. It has been too long, my old friend. Highness. Here, Father. Take my arm. I think it is time for me to leave. So much for the glory of Rome. Magnificent battle. General. Still alive? Still alive. The gods must have a sense of humor. The gods must love you. Valerius. Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome? Home. My wife, my son, the harvest. Maximus the farmer. I still have difficulty imagining that. You know, dirt cleans off a lot easier than blood, Quintus. - Here he is. - Highness. Senator Gaius, Senator Falco. Beware of Gaius. He'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear... and you'll wake up one day and all you'll say is, Republic."" Well, why not? Rome was founded as a republic. Yes, and in a republic the senate has the power. But Senator Gaius isn't influenced by that, of course. Where do you stand, General? Emperor or Senate? A soldier has the advantage of being able to look his enemy in the eye, Senator. Well, with an army behind you, you could be extremely political. I warned you. Now I shall save you. Senators. Maximus. I'm going to need good men like you. How may I be of service, Highness? You're a man who knows what it is to command. You give your orders, the orders are obeyed, and the battle is won. But these senators scheme, squabble and flatter and deceive. We must save Rome from the politicians, my friend. Can I count on you when the time comes? Highness, when your father releases me, I intend to return home. Home? Well, no one's earned it more. Don't get too comfortable. I may call on you before long. Lucilla's here. Did you know? She's not forgotten you. And now, you're the great man. If only you had been born a man... what a Caesar you would have made. Father. You would have been strong. I wonder, would you have been just? I would have been what you taught me to be. How was your journey? Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come? I need your help. With your brother. Of course. He loves you. He always has. And... he will need you now, more than ever. Enough of politics. Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter... and I am a good father. This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it? Good morning. I need three more horses. Two! Three! Four! One! Two! You sent for me, Caesar? - Caesar? - Tell me again, Maximus. Why are we here? For the glory of the empire, sire. Yes. Yes, I remember. Do you see that map, Maximus? That is the world which I created. For years... I have conquered, spilt blood, expanded the empire. Since I became Caesar, I've known four years without war. Four years of peace in 20. And for what? I brought the sword. Nothing more. Caesar, your life... Please. Please don't call me that. Come. Please. Come sit. Let us talk together now... very simply, as men. Well, Maximus... talk. 5,000 of my men are out there in the freezing mud. 3,000 of them are bloodied and cleaved. 2,000 will never leave this place. I will not believe that they fought and died for nothing. And what would you believe? They fought for you and for Rome. And what is Rome, Maximus? I've seen much of the rest of the world. It is brutal and cruel and dark. Rome is the light. Yet you have never been there. You have not seen what it has become. I am dying, Maximus. When a man sees his end... he wants to know there was some purpose to his life. How will the world speak my name in years to come? Will I be known as the philosopher? The warrior? The tyrant? Or will I be the Emperor who gave Rome back her true self? There was once a dream that was Rome. You could only whisper it. Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish... it was so fragile. And I fear that it will not survive the winter. Maximus... let us whisper now... together, you and I. You have a son. Tell me about your home. My house is in the hills above Trujillo. A very simple place. Pink stones that warm in the sun. A kitchen garden that smells of herbs in the day... jasmine in the evening. Through the gate is a giant poplar. Figs, apples, pears. The soil, Marcus, black. Black like my wife's hair. Grapes on the south slopes, olives on the north. Wild ponies play near my house. They tease my son. He wants to be one of them. When was the last time you were home? Two years, days and this morning. I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home. Worth fighting for. There is one more duty... that I ask of you before you go home. What would you have me do, Caesar? I want you to become the protector of Rome after I die. I will empower you to one end alone... to give power back to the people of Rome... and end the corruption that has crippled it. Will you accept this great honor that I have offered you? With all my heart, no. Maximus... that is why it must be you. But surely a prefect, a senator... somebody who knows the city, who understands her politics. But you have not been corrupted by her politics. - And Commodus? - Commodus is not a moral man. You have known that since you were young. Commodus cannot rule. He must not rule. You are the son that I should have had. Commodus will accept my decision. He knows that you command the loyalty of the army. I need some time, sire. Yes. By sunset, I hope you will have agreed. Now embrace me as my son. And bring an old man another blanket. My father favors you now. My lady. - It was not always so. - Many things change. Many things. Not everything. Maximus, stop. Let me see your face. You seem upset. I lost many men. What did my father want with you? To wish me well before I leave for home. You're lying. I could always tell when you were lying because you were never any good at it. - I never acquired your comfort with it. - True. But then you never had to. Life is more simple for a soldier. Or do you think me heartless? I think you have a talent for survival. Maximus, stop. Is it really so terrible seeing me again? No. I'm tired from battle. It hurts you to see my father so fragile. Commodus expects that my father will announce his succession within days. Will you serve my brother as you served his father? I will always serve Rome. Do you know... I still remember you in my prayers. Oh, yes. I pray. I was sad to hear of your husband's death. I mourned him. - Thank you. - And I hear you have a son. Yes. Lucius. He'll be nearly eight years old. My son is also nearly eight. I thank you for your prayers. Ancestors, I ask for your guidance. Blessed Mother, come to me with the gods' desire for my future. Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son with a ready sword. Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again. Ancestors, I honor you... and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me. Cicero. Sir. Do you ever find it hard to do your duty? Sometimes I do what I want to do. The rest of the time, I do what I have to. We may not be able to go home, after all. Are you ready to do your duty for Rome? Yes, Father. You will not be emperor. Which wiser, older man is to take my place? My powers will pass to Maximus... to hold in trust... until the Senate is ready to rule once more. Rome is to be a republic again. Maximus. Yes. My decision disappoints you? You wrote to me once... listing the four chief virtues: Wisdom... justice... fortitude... and temperance. As I read the list, I knew I had none of them. But I have other virtues, Father. Ambition. That can be a virtue when it drives us to excel. Resourcefulness, courage. Perhaps not on the battlefield, but there are many forms of courage. Devotion to my family... to you. But none of my virtues were on your list. Even then it was as if you didn't want me for your son. Commodus... you go too far. I searched the faces of the gods... for ways to please you, to make you proud. One kind word... one full hug... where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight... would have been like the sun on my heart for 1,000 years. What is it in me you hate so much? Commodus. All I've ever wanted... was to live up to you, Caesar. Father. Commodus... your faults as a son... is my failure as a father. Come. Father. I would butcher the whole world... if you would only have loved me! Maximus, the Emperor needs you. It's urgent. Lament with me, brother. Our great father is dead. How did he die? The surgeons say there was no pain. His breath gave out as he slept. Father. Your emperor asks for your loyalty, Maximus. Take my hand. I only offer it once. Quintus. Hail, Caesar. I must talk to the senators. I need their counsel. - Wake Gaius and Falco. - Gaius and Falco. Sword. Maximus, please be careful. That was not prudent. Prudent? The Emperor has been slain. The Emperor died of natural causes. - Why are you armed, Quintus? - Guards! Please don't fight, Maximus. I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken. Ride until dawn... and then execute him. Quintus, look at me. Look at me! Promise me that you will look after my family. Your family will meet you in the afterlife. Kneel. Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son. Whisper to them that I live only to hold them again. At least give me a clean death. A soldier's death. The frost, sometimes it makes the blade stick. Praetorian! When was the last time you were home? Two years, days and this morning. Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son... I will try to live with the dignity you have taught me. Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again. ... with a ready sword, for all else is dust and air. Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again. For all else is dust and air. Papa! Don't die. You'll meet them again. Not yet. No. They will clean it. Wait and see. Don't die. They'll feed you to the lions. They are worth more than we are. Better now? Clean. You see? Proximo! My old friend. Every day is a great day when you are here... but today is your most fortunate day. Those giraffes you sold me, they won't mate. They just walk around eating and not mating. You sold me queer giraffes. - I want my money back. - Not a chance. I do special price for you. On what? Have you seen my new stock? Come and see them. Do any of them fight? I've got a match coming up. Some are good for fighting, others for dying. You need both, I think. Get up. What's your trade? I was a hunter. No, I bought him from a salt mine in Carthage. Sit down. Mark of the legion. Deserter. Maybe so, but who cares? He's a Spaniard. I'll take six. For 1,000. One thousand? The Numidian alone is worth 2,000. These slaves are rotten. It all adds to the flavor. No, wait! I can negotiate. I'll give you 2,000, and 4,000 for the beasts. That's 5,000 for an old friend. Come on! How long does it take to get into my own house? I am Proximo. I shall be closer to you for the next few days... which will be the last of your miserable lives... than that bitch of a mother that brought you screaming into this world. I did not pay good money for you for your company. I paid it so that I could profit from your death. And as your mother was there at your beginning... so I shall be there at your end. And when you die, and die you shall... your transition shall be to the sound of... Gladiators... I salute you. Red. Yellow. Yellow. Good. Red. Spaniard. That's enough for the moment! His time will come. Next. Spaniard... why don't you fight? We all have to fight. Well, I don't fight. I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe, I write down words... and speak seven languages. Good. Tomorrow, you can scream in seven languages. Perhaps the scribe will be the one who wins his freedom. Freedom? What do I have to do? You go in the arena and you kill me. And him... and the Numidian... and the deserter. And more. And when there's no more to fight, you're free. I can't do that. No? But I can. Is that the sign of your gods? Will that not anger them? The gods favor you. Red is the gods' color. You will need their help today. Proximo! Still leading with the German? The crowd love a barbarian. Besides that, he's making me rich. Has that Numidian fought before? No, first time. And that one, laborer, soldier? He's a Spaniard. He might as well be a eunuch, for what he brings to the ring. Five hundred sestertii, the Numidian and Spaniard team makes it through. And 1,000, that the Numidian makes it through alone. Are you asking me to bet against my own man? It's unethical. What if I make it 2,000? Some of you are thinking you won't fight... some that you can't fight. They all say that until they're out there. Listen. Kill! Thrust this into another man's flesh... and they will applaud and love you for that. And you... you may begin to love them... for that. Ultimately, we're all dead men. Sadly, we cannot choose how... but we can decide how we meet that end... in order that we are remembered... as men. Come on! On the left, draw your shields! On the right, draw your swords! Kill! Kill! Pair them up: Red with yellow. Next! Move! Usurper! Go away! You'll never rule us, Commodus! He enters Rome like a conquering hero. But what has he conquered? Give him time, Gracchus. He's young. I think he could do very well. For Rome, or for you? Go to your mother, Lucius. It's what she'd like. Lucius! Mother! Hail, Caesar. Senators. Rome greets her new emperor. Your loyal subjects bid you welcome, Highness. Thank you, Falco. And for the loyal subjects, I trust they weren't too expensive. Caesar. Gracchus. All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar. There are many matters that require your attention. To order, please. To order. For your guidance, Caesar, the Senate has prepared a series of protocols... to begin addressing the many problems in the city... beginning with basic sanitation for the Greek Quarter... to combat the plague which is already springing up there. So, if Caesar... Don't you see, Gracchus? That's the very problem, isn't it? My father spent all his time at study... at books of learning and philosophy. He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the Senate. And all the while, the people were forgotten. But the Senate is the people, sire... chosen from among the people to speak for the people. I doubt many of the people eat so well as you do, Gracchus. Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius. I think I understand my own people. Then perhaps Caesar will be so good as to teach us... out of his own extensive experience. I call it love. I am their father. The people are my children. I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly. Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire? No, but if you interrupt me again... I assure you that you shall. Senator, my brother is very tired. Leave your list with me. Caesar shall do all that Rome requires. My lady, as always, your lightest touch commands obedience. Who are they to lecture me? Commodus, the Senate has its uses. What uses? All they do is talk. It should be just you and me and Rome. Don't even think it. There's always been a Senate. Rome has changed. It takes an emperor to rule an empire. Of course, but leave the people their... Illusions? Traditions. My father's war against the barbarians... He said it himself: It achieved nothing. But the people loved him. The people always love victories. Why? They didn't see the battles. What do they care about Germania? They care about the greatness of Rome. ""The greatness of Rome."" Well, what is that? It's an idea. Greatness. Greatness is a vision. Exactly. A vision. Do you not see, Lucilla? I will give the people a vision of Rome, and they'll love me for it. And they'll soon forget the tedious sermonizing of a few dry old men. I will give the people the greatest vision of their lives. White and red wine for your drinking pleasure! Games. One hundred and fifty days of games. He's cleverer than I thought. Clever. The whole of Rome would be laughing at him... if they weren't so afraid of his Praetorians. Fear and wonder. A powerful combination. You really think the people are going to be seduced by that? I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob. Conjure magic for them, and they'll be distracted. Take away their freedom, and still they'll roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate. It's the sand of the Colosseum. He'll bring them death... and they will love him for it. All you do is kill, kill, kill. The crowd don't want a butcher, they want a hero. We want them to keep coming back. So don't just hack them to pieces, remember you are an entertainer. Spaniard. So entertain! Are you not entertained? Is this not why you're here? Spaniard! What do you want? Girl? Boy? - You sent for me. - Yes, I did. You're good, Spaniard, but you're not that good. You could be magnificent. I'm required to kill, so I kill. That is enough. That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome. The young emperor has arranged a series of spectacles... to commemorate his father, Marcus Aurelius. I find that amusing... since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise... the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius, that closed us down. So finally, after five years of scratching a living... in flea-infested villages... we're finally going back to where we belong: The Colosseum. You should see the Colosseum, Spaniard. Fifty-thousand Romans... watching every movement of your sword... willing you to make that killer blow. The silence before you strike and the noise afterwards. It rises. It rises up... like a storm. As if you were the thunder god himself. - You were a gladiator? - Yes, I was. You won your freedom? A long time ago, the Emperor... presented me with a rudius. It's just a wooden sword. The symbol of your freedom. He touched me on the shoulder, and I was free. You knew Marcus Aurelius? I did not say I knew him. I said he touched me on the shoulder once. You asked me what I want. I, too, want to stand in front of the Emperor... as you did. Then listen to me. Learn from me. I wasn't the best because I killed quickly. I was the best because the crowd loved me. Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom. I will win the crowd. I will give them something they've never seen before. So, Spaniard, we shall go to Rome together... and have bloody adventures. And the great whore will suckle us... until we are fat and happy and can suckle no more. And then... when enough men have died... perhaps you will have your freedom. Here. Use this. It's somewhere out there, my country. My home. My wife is preparing food. My daughters carry water from the river. Will I ever see them again? I think, no. Do you believe you'll see them again when you die? I think so. But then, I will die soon. They will not die for many years. I'll have to wait. But you would? Wait? Of course. You see... my wife... and my son are already waiting for me. You'll meet them again. But not yet. Not yet. - Unless... - Not yet. Not yet. There he is. Out. Move, go, out! Good to see you again, old friend. Bring me fortune. Have you ever seen anything like that before? I didn't know men could build such things. Win the crowd. Get inside. Move. Inside. He sleeps so well because he's loved. Come, brother. It's late. I will make Rome the wonder of the ages. That is what Gracchus and his friends don't understand. All my desires are splitting my head to pieces. Commodus, drink this tonic. I think the time is almost right. I could announce the dissolution of the Senate... at the celebration to honor our father. Do you think I should? Are the people ready? I think you need your rest now. Will you stay with me? Still afraid of the dark, brother? Still. Always. - Stay with me tonight. - You know I won't. Then kiss me. Sleep, brother. Having servants who are deaf and mute... at least ensures I live a little longer. They're arresting scholars now. Anyone who dare speak out. Even satirists and chroniclers. And mathematicians. And all to feed the arena. The Senate did not approve martial law. This reign of terror is entirely the Praetorians. I'm afraid to go out after dark. You should be more afraid of your activities during the day. The Senate is full of his spies, led by that whore master, Falco. But what is in his mind? That's what I trouble myself with. He spends all his days singularly obsessed... planning the festival to honor your father. He neglects even the most fundamental task of government. So just what is he planning? And what pays for it? These daily games are costing a fortune, yet we have no new taxes. The future. The future pays for it. He's started selling the grain reserves. This can't be true. He's selling Rome's reserves of grain. The people will be starving in two years. I hope they're enjoying the games... because soon enough they'll be dead because of them. - Rome must know this. - And how? He's going to dissolve the Senate. And who will tell them before it's too late? You, Gracchus? You, Gaius. Will you make a speech on the floor of the Senate, denouncing my brother? And then see your family in the Colosseum? Who'd dare? I have been living in a prison of fear every day... because my son is heir to the throne. He must die. Quintus and the Praetorians would simply seize control for themselves. No. Cut off the head and the snake cannot strike. Lucilla, Gaius is right. Until we can neutralize the Praetorians, we can achieve nothing. So we do nothing? No, child. We keep our counsel. We prepare. As long as the people support him, we are voices without steel. We are air. But with every day that passes, he makes enemies. One day, he'll have more enemies than friends. And on that day, we will act. Then we will strike. But until then... we are docile. We are obedient. And we are treacherous. Come on! All right, that's enough. The Emperor wants battles, and I don't want to sacrifice my best fighters. The crowd wants battles, so the Emperor gives them battles. - You get the battle of Carthage. - Massacre of Carthage. Well, why don't you go down to the prison, round up all the beggars and thieves? We've done that. If you want to give away the best gladiators in the whole of the empire... then I want double the rates. You'll get your contract rates, or you'll get your contract cancelled. You don't like it? Then you can crawl back down that shit hole that you came from. Cassius, please. You can free us. Gladiator, are you the one they call the Spaniard? Yes. They said you were a giant. They said you could crush a man's skull with one hand. A man's? No. A boy's. - Do they have good horses in Spain? - Some of the best. This is Argento and this is Scarto. They were my horses. They were taken from me. I like you, Spaniard. I shall cheer for you. - They let you watch the games? - My uncle says it makes me strong. - And what does your father say? - My father is dead. Master Lucius, it is time. I have to go. Your name is Lucius? Lucius Verus, after my father. Lower! Claudius! Yes? More shields! All right. When the Emperor enters, raise your weapons, salute him... and then speak together. Face the Emperor and don't turn your back on him. Go, and die with honor. Hail, mighty Caesar! Caesar! We who are about to die salute you! On this day... we reach back to hallowed antiquity... to bring you a re-creation of the second fall... of mighty Carthage! On the barren plain of Zama... there stood the invincible armies... of the barbarian Hannibal. Ferocious mercenaries and warriors... from all brute nations... bent on merciless destruction... conquest. Your emperor is pleased to give you... the barbarian horde! Anyone here been in the army? Yes. I served with you at Vindobona. You can help me. Whatever comes out of these gates... we've got a better chance of survival if we work together. Do you understand? If we stay together, we survive. The Emperor is pleased to bring you the legionnaires... of Scipio Africanus! To the death! Kill! Stay close. Come together! Stay close. Staggered columns! You don't have a chance. Lock your shields. Stay as one. Hold! Hold! As one! Well done. Hold. Down low! Yes! Hagen! This column to the chariot! This column stay with me! Quickly! - Get out there. - Hurry! Maximus! Single column! We win! My history's a little hazy, Cassius... but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage? Yes, sire. Forgive me, sire. No, I rather enjoy surprises. Who is he? They call him the Spaniard, sire. I think I'll meet him. Yes, sire. Hail to the barbarians! Forward! Arms at ready! Drop your weapons. Gladiator, the Emperor has asked for you. I am at the Emperor's service. Rise. Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard. I don't think there's ever been a gladiator to match you. As for this young man, he insists you are Hector reborn. Or was it Hercules? Why doesn't the hero reveal himself and tell us all your real name? You do have a name. My name is Gladiator. How dare you show your back to me? Slave! You will remove your helmet and tell me your name. My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius... commander of the armies of the north... general of the Felix Legions... loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius... father to a murdered son... husband to a murdered wife... and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next. Arms! Live! Arms, at rest! Maximus! Father. Why is he still alive? I don't know. He shouldn't be alive. It vexes me. I'm terribly vexed. I did what I had to do. If Father had had his way, the empire would have been torn apart. You do see that. Yes. What did you feel when you saw him? I felt nothing. He wounded you deeply, didn't he? No more than I wounded him. They lied to me in Germania. They told me he was dead. If they lie to me, they don't respect me. If they don't respect me, how can they ever love me? Then you must let the legions know... their treachery will not go unpunished. Poor sister. I wouldn't want to be your enemy. What will you do? This way. Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions. I knew your brother would send assassins. I didn't realize he would send his best. Maximus, he doesn't know. My family was burnt and crucified while they were still alive. - I knew nothing... - Don't lie to me! I wept for them. As you wept for your father? I have been living in a prison of fear since that day. To be unable to mourn your father for fear of your brother. To live in terror every moment of every day... because your son is heir to the throne. I have wept. My son was innocent. So is mine. Must my son die, too, before you'll trust me? What does it matter if I trust you or not? The gods have spared you. Don't you understand? Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the emperor of Rome. The gods have spared me? I am at their mercy, with the power only to amuse a mob. That is power. The mob is Rome. And while Commodus controls them, he controls everything. Listen to me. My brother has enemies, most of all in the Senate. But while the people follow him... no one would dare stand up to him until you. They oppose him, yet they do nothing. There are some politicians who have dedicated their lives to Rome. One man above all. If I can arrange it, will you meet him? Do you not understand? I may die in this cell tonight, or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave! What possible difference can I make? This man wants what you want. Then have him kill Commodus! I knew a man once... a noble man. A man of principle who loved my father... and my father loved him. This man served Rome well. That man is gone. Your brother did his work well. Let me help you. Yes, you can help me. Forget you ever knew me, never come here again. Guard! The lady is finished with me. What's your name? Julian Crassus. Name? Marcus, sire. My father's name. They must have known of Maximus' escape when they found the bodies of the four men. They thought it was a barbarian raid. These are good men, sire. Loyal to the Emperor. Load your arrows! Prepare to fire! Then perhaps it was you who knew... and never told me. - I didn't know. - You didn't know? But a general is always in control. Always in command, isn't he? Yes, Caesar. Then give the command. Say it. Fire. Maximus. You commanded legions? You had many victories? - Yes. - In Germania? In many countries. General. You have a great name. He must kill your name before he kills you. Yes, at the far end. Senator Gaius. Hello. Senator Gracchus. Don't often see you enjoying the pleasures of the vulgar crowd. I don't pretend to be a man of the people, Senator... but I do try to be a man for the people. Caesar! People of Rome! On the fourth day of Antioch... we can celebrate the 64th day of the games. And in his majestic charity... the Emperor has deigned this day to favor the people of Rome... with an historical final match. Returning to the Colosseum today, after five years in retirement... Caesar is pleased to bring you... the only undefeated champion... in Roman history: The legendary Tigris of Gaul! He knows too well how to manipulate the mob. Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Rome, Proximo. This is not it. Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus. We mortals are but shadows and dust. Shadows and dust, Maximus! Representing the training lyceum of Antonius Proximo... Caesar is proud to give you... Aelius Maximus! They embrace him like he's one of their own. The mob is fickle, brother. He'll be forgotten in a month. No, much sooner than that. It's been arranged. We who are about to die salute you. We're with you, Maximus! Fight on, finish it! Pull, pull! Loose! Loose! Gut him! Kill! Kill! Maximus the Merciful! Maximus! Forward, arms at ready! What am I going to do with you? You simply won't die. Are we so different, you and I? You take life when you have to, as I do. I have only one more life to take. Then it is done. Then take it now. They tell me your son... squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross. And your wife... moaned like a whore... when they ravaged her again and again... and again. The time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end... Highness. Maximus! General! General! Cicero! - Where are you camped? - Ostia. We love you, Maximus! Praise the victor! Tell the men their general lives. Find me. Move along! Find me! Can they hear you? - Who? - Your family, in the afterlife. Yes. What do you say to them? To my boy... I tell him I will see him again soon... and to keep his heels down when he's riding his horse. To my wife... that is not your business. And now they love Maximus for his mercy. So I can't just kill him, or it makes me even more unmerciful. The whole thing is like some great nightmare. He is defying you. His every victory is an act of defiance. The mob sees this, and so do the Senate. Every day he lives, they grow bolder. - Kill him. - No. I will not make a martyr of him. When I went to the Senate today... I purposefully told them about using the grain reserves to pay for the games. And did you note what happened? - Nothing. - Exactly. Nothing. Not a single word of protest. Even the insolent Senator Gracchus was silent as a mouse. Why? I have been told of a certain sea snake... which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey. It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as if wounded. Then its enemies will approach... and yet it will lie quite still. And then its enemies will take little bites of it... and yet it remains still. So... we will lie still... and let our enemies come to us and nibble. Have every senator followed. Cicero, my old friend. I thought perhaps I'd seen you for the last time. I thought you were dead. Close. - How long have the men been in Ostia? - All winter. - And how do they look? - Fat and bored. Who's in command? Some fool from Rome. How soon do you think they could be ready to fight? For you, tomorrow. I need you to do something for me. Come, see, witness. If you haven't been in the arena, you can see the show here. Giant Maximus is defeating our emperor, Commodus. What are we to do? He's just defying everyone... by doing this to him, they do... My goodness! He got him, he's defeated. Give way! My lady? I served your father at Vindobona. Back. My lady. I served your father at Vindobona. Back! And I served General Maximus. I serve him still. Stop. Stand back. The General sends word, he will meet your politician. - For your loyalty, soldier. - Thank you, my lady. Leave us. Senator Gracchus. General. I hope my coming here today is evidence enough... that you can trust me. - The Senate is with you? - The Senate? Yes. I can speak for them. You can buy my freedom and smuggle me out of Rome? To what end? Get me outside the city walls. Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia. My army is encamped there. By nightfall of the second day, I'll return at the head of 5,000 men. But the legions all have new commanders... loyal to Commodus. Let my men see me alive, and you shall see where their loyalties lie. This is madness. No Roman army has entered the capital in years. I will not trade one dictatorship for another! The time for half measures and talk is over, Senator. And after your glorious coup, what then? You'll take your 5,000 warriors and leave? I will leave. The soldiers will stay for your protection under the command of the Senate. So... once all of Rome is yours, you'll just give it back to the people? Tell me why. Because that was the last wish of a dying man. I will kill Commodus. The fate of Rome I leave to you. Marcus Aurelius trusted you. His daughter trusts you. I will trust you. But we have little time. Give me two days... and I will buy your freedom. And you... You stay alive... or I'll be dead. Now we must go. He'll be waiting for you. Stand at the foot of the colossus. He'll find you. It won't work. The Emperor knows too much. And as for me... it's becoming dangerous. You'll be paid on my return. I give you my word. Your word? What if you don't return? Do you remember what it was to have trust, Proximo? Trust? Who am I to trust? I will kill Commodus. Why would I want that? He makes me rich. I know that you are a man of your word, General. I know that you would die for honor. You would die for Rome. You would die for the memory of your ancestors. But I, on the other hand... I'm an entertainer. Guard! He killed the man who set you free. Praetorians, master. Halt! Where have you been? I sent for you. Please, brother. What's troubling you? Does Gracchus have a new lover? I don't know. I thought you'd seen him. He infects everyone like a putrid fever. For the health of Rome, the Senate must be bled. And he will bleed, too. Very soon. But not tonight. Do you remember what our father said once? ""It's a dream... ""a frightful dream... ""life is."" Do you think that's true? I don't know. I think it is. And I have only you to share it with. Open your mouth. You know I love you. And I love you. Out. Get out! Move! Congratulations, General. You've got very persuasive friends. My brother has had Gracchus arrested. We daren't wait any longer. We must leave tonight. Proximo will come at midnight and take you to the gate. Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting there with horses. You have done all this? Yes. You risk too much. I have much to pay for. You have nothing to pay for. You love your son. You're strong for him. I am tired of being strong. My brother hates all the world, and you most of all. Because your father chose me. No. Because my father loved you. And because I loved you. A long time ago. Was I very different then? You laughed more. I have felt alone all my life... except with you. I must go. Yes. There. And I got you. Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire? I'm not a legionnaire. - Not a legionnaire? - I'm a gladiator. A gladiator? Gladiators only fight in the games. Wouldn't you rather be a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar? I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome! The savior of Rome? And who said that? Where's Lucius? He's with the Emperor, my lady. She couldn't. She did. She took it from a basket... and pressed it to her breast, right here above her heart. It bit her in the breast? Yes. You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies... behave very strangely and do very odd things in the name of love. I think it's silly. So do I. Sister, join us. I've been reading to dear Lucius. I've been reading, too. Yes. He's a very clever little boy. He'll make a grand emperor one day. We've been reading about the great Mark Antony and his adventures in Egypt. And the queen killed herself with a snake. And just wait until you hear what happened to our ancestors. If you're very good, tomorrow night I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius. He was betrayed... by those closest to him. By his own blood. They whispered in dark corners... and went out late at night... and conspired, and conspired. But the Emperor Claudius knew that they were up to something. He knew they were busy little bees. And one night he sat down with one of them... and he looked at her... and he said: ""Tell me what you've been doing... ""busy little bee. ""Or I shall strike down those dearest to you. ""You shall watch as I bathe in their blood."" And the Emperor was heartbroken. The little bee had wounded him more deeply than anyone else could ever have done. What do you think happened then, Lucius? I don't know, Uncle. The little bee told him everything. Open, in the name of the Emperor! Proximo! Open the gates, in the name of the Emperor! Open the gates! Open the gates, Proximo. Do you want to die, old man? Here. Everything is prepared. It seems you have won your freedom. Proximo, are you in danger of becoming a good man? - Juba. - All enemies of the emperor die! Open the gates! Pull! Move! Form a column on the left! I only need moments, so do not be careless with your lives. If you don't want any part of this, go back to your cells. We'll wait here for you, Maximus. Strength and honor. Go. Strength and honor. Aim. Arch your bows! Shadows and dust. Maximus! I'm sorry. It's done. And what of my nephew? And what of his mother? Should they share her lover's fate? Or should I be merciful? Commodus the Merciful. Lucius will stay with me now. And if his mother... so much as looks at me... in a manner that displeases me... he will die. If she decides to be noble... and takes her own life... he will die. And as for you... you will love me... as I have loved you. You will provide me with an heir of pure blood... so that Commodus... and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years. Am I not merciful? Am I not merciful! Maximus! I'm a soldier. I obey. Nothing happens to anyone that he is not fitted by nature to bear. Maximus! They call for you. The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor. A striking story. Now the people want to know how the story ends. Only a famous death will do. And what could be more glorious... than to challenge the Emperor himself in the great arena? You would fight me? Why not? Do you think I'm afraid? I think you have been afraid all your life. Unlike Maximus the Invincible, who knows no fear? I knew a man who once said, ""Death smiles at us all. ""All a man can do is smile back."" I wonder... did your friend smile at his own death? You must know. He was your father. You loved my father, I know... but so did I. That makes us brothers, doesn't it? Smile for me now, brother. Strap on his armor. Conceal the wound. Ring formation! Quintus, sword. Give me your sword. Sword! Give me a sword! Sheathe your swords. Maximus. Quintus. Free my men. Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated. There was a dream that was Rome. It shall be realized. These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius. Free the prisoners. Go! Maximus. Lucius is safe. Go to them. You're home. Is Rome worth one good man's life? We believed it once. Make us believe it again. He was a soldier of Rome. Honor him. Who will help me carry him? Now we are free. I will see you again. But not yet. Not yet."
55,2012,Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,American,"It has been four years since the events of the first movie. Seventeen-year-old Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) is caught by the police after a brief chase on his dirtbike which ends with him driving into a swimming pool while trying to evade them. Minutes later, his stepfather Hank (Dwayne Johnson) arrives when a police officer (Stephen Caudill), who is friends with Hank tells him that Sean has illegally broken into a remote satellite research center, and that he has talked Mr. and Mrs. McGillicutty (the owners of the swimming pool) out of pressing charges. Hank takes Sean home where his mother Elizabeth (Kristin Davis) is not pleased with his actions and the fact that he and Hank don't get along well.
Hank discovers that Sean trespassed in the satellite research center in order to boost the signal of a code Sean received from someone he suspects is Alexander Anderson, Sean's grandfather who had been missing for two years. Wanting to bond with his stepson, the next day Hank helps Sean decipher the code of Jules Verne characters which lead to three books: Treasure Island, Gulliver's Travels, and Verne's own Mysterious Island. Using the books' individual island maps, Hank suspects they are books about the same island and uses a back light in order to make them all one completed land mass with the coordinates to its location. Hank manages to convince Liz to let both of them go in search of the island, in the slight hope of proving Sean wrong, that there is no so-called mysterious island there.
They arrive in Palau where they need transportation to travel to this dangerous part of the ocean. A Palauan helicopter tourism guide Gabato (Luis Guzman) and his daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens), who Sean develops an immediate crush on, agree to fly them out to the island for $3,000, but the helicopter gets caught in a hurricane and they crash into the Pacific, waking up on the island.
Moving into the island, they discover one of the laws of the Mysterious Island is that, traditionally small animals become large and large animals become small (inspired by Lilliput from Gulliver's Travels). The crew discover tiny elephants and giant butterflies, which are the first creatures they come across on the island. The group decides to explore further into the island.
After leaving that part of the island they come across an egg clutch belonging to a Giant Frilled Lizard, they are then saved by Sean's grandfather Alexander (Michael Caine) who takes them to a large hut he'd built from the wreckage of the ship that brought him to the island, called the Blue-Eyed Lucy. He has a working radio, but due to the positioning of the communications satellite it will be two weeks before they could call for help.
The next morning, Alexander leads the group to the lost city of Atlantis which is usually submerged in the ocean and he also calculates that the island sinks once every 70 years. However, Hank discovers the sea water appearing from the ground is the evidence that Alexander's calculations are wrong, and that the island will sink in a couple of days. Their only means of salvation seems to be the legendary Nautilus (Captain Nemo's submarine), hidden somewhere on the island. Kailani enters Nemo's crypt and finds his journal, which shows the whereabouts of the ship in a cave at Poseidon's Cliffs. They decide to go to that cave through the heart of the island.
They mount giant bees in order to fly over a high ridge and make up time, but encounter large birds that try to devour the bees. After saving Kailani's life, Sean crashes and dislocates his ankle. Hank and Alexander patch up Sean's ankle the best way they can. Afterward, they have a bonding moment when Hank sings his rendition of ""What a Wonderful World"" to ease Sean's pain.
The next morning, the water has risen greatly and Hank deduces that the island will sink in a matter of hours, not days. Gabato is missing, having gone toward the island's golden volcano (inspired byTreasure Island) in search of gold to give his daughter a better life. While Alexander and Kailani go after him, Sean and Hank head for Poseidon's Cliffs to look for the Nautilus. Alexander also finally calls Hank by his preferred name, as up to that point he only called him ""Henry"" and the family makes up.
To deal with the rising water after finding the Nautilus' cave underwater, Sean and Hank create makeshift oxygen tanks and dive down fifty feet in order to obtain the Nautilus and are nearly killed by a giant electric eel. They are unable to power the ship however, because the vessel's batteries have run down due to being 140 years old. They engineer a way to power the submarine from the electric eel's electricity.
Meanwhile, Kailani and Alexander find Gabato and convince him to escape with them instead of trying for the golden volcano. They head towards the shore as the island begins to suddenly and violently rip itself apart. The golden volcano starts to erupt violently, pouring lava all over the area. Highly flammable lava bombs are thrown from the golden volcano into the air and suddenly land on the sinking island's debris. Sean and Hank use a harpoon to get an electrical jump start from the electric eel swarming around them and they are able to power the machine, just in time to pick up the others who had fallen into the water. Gabato pilots the submarine out of harm's way while Hank and Sean fire torpedoes into the path of falling island debris. As they clear the dangers, Kailani finally kisses Sean for his bravery.
Six months later, Kailani and Gabato are well off. Gabato is now running the most popular tourist attraction on Palau providing tours aboard the Nautilus and Kailani is attending college. Kailani goes to visit Sean on his birthday. While they are celebrating, Alexander shows up with a book for Sean's birthday present. Sean opens it to find Jules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon, Alexander's suggestion for a new adventure with the family, to which Liz protests. Hank replies ""What could possibly go wrong? It's only the moon!""
During the credits, the mini-elephants from the earlier scene are swimming underwater over Atlantis.",5.7,tt1397514,"THUNDER CRASHING ALEXANDER: In the 19th century... ...Jules Verne wrote some of the greatest adventure stories ever told Novels such as Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea... ...Journey to the Center of the Earth... ...and The Mysterious Island. Most consider these works of science fiction. Vernians know otherwise. SIRENS WAILING SEAN: Not good! BELL RINGING Whoa! SEAN YELLS TIRES SCREECHING SEAN GRUNTING Ha-ha-ha. Aah! Whoa! Good boy! Seriously? Okay. Here we... ...go! SEAN YELLS PANTING Evening, officers. Anyone up for a late night swim? SIREN WHOOPING INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER Hey, buddy. Missed you at poker this week. Thanks for the call. What's going on? We didn't want this going out over the radio. Kid broke into a satellite facility. Then he drove... ...his dirt bike into... ...the McGillicuttys' pool. I talked them out of pressing charges. Anderson! Your stepfather's here for you. No. Legal guardian. HANK: If it weren't for me, you'd be in juvie for the next six months. Rather do the time. Do you want to explain to me... ...why you were breaking into a satellite facility in the middle of nowhere? Don't worry about it, Mom. It's nothing, really. The police calling in the middle of the night is nothing? Sean? What was he doing there? What was he looking for? HANK: Honey, I don't know. All we can do is ask him. Hey. Sean, we gotta talk about this. I'm confused. Who gave him a speaking part? - Hey. - Without my speaking part, we'd visit you... - ...in jail right now. - I'm already in jail. LIZ: What is that supposed to mean? Sean? I didn't ask to be taken away from my school and friends, and dragged all the way to Dayton. - It's okay, Liz. - No, it's not. Sean! - Sean! HANK: It's gotta be tough on him... ...with his father gone. LIZ: That still doesn't excuse his behavior. SEAN: Okay. Now that I got you, I just gotta figure out what you mean. CROCODILES' ""SLEEP FOREVER"" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS SEAN: Not here. Hey, it's me. You busy? SEAN: Yes. I was looking to talk to you. You know, very concerned adult to somewhat troubled youth. Which one am I in that equation? Cracked up the walkway to my door Brought you as a... MUSIC STOPS Hey, buddy. What's all this? Nothing. That's a cryptogram, right? Looks like Morse code. SEAN: Mm-hm. Yeah, look. One syllable words, dots. Two syllable words, dashes. I learned that in the Navy. Okay, then. What's it say? What's it for? It's complicated. So is the code. Okay. Here's the deal. A few nights ago, a radio signal got sent out. Could've been anywhere. It was these words on a loop. HANK: ""Pip, Zorn, Strux."" All characters from the books of Verne. The message was by a Vernian. And my equipment wasn't powerful enough to receive the whole message, so... So you broke into that satellite facility to boost your signal. Someone sent this message and I'm gonna be the person to solve it. This is really important to me. Hey, you know what? Why don't we solve this together? Fine. Okay. The first part of the message reads, ""The... ...I-S-L."" Island. ""Is..."" R-E. ""Real. The island is real."" You're serious? You're not messing with me? No. That's what it says. ""The island is real."" I can't believe it. I can't believe somebody actually found the island. What island? The Mysterious Island. Vernians have been looking for this for years. What's the rest say? ""Child of Steve, born... ...eighteen... ...eight-three."" ""Born 1883."" Child of Steve. Child of Steve. Maybe ""son of Steve""? Steven's son. Stevenson. - Robert Louis Stevenson. - The author. He was born way before 1883. Gotta be somebody else. Maybe it's not a somebody. Maybe it's a something. What are we looking for? Come on. Aha! Treasure Island, written by Robert Louis Stevenson in 1883. - What's the next part of the riddle? - All right. ""The name that's last is going fast. - He hitched his tale to Lemuel's mast."" - Okay, so his... - ...last name is going fast. A runner? - What if his last name... ...is fast? Fleet or Quick. Swift. Swift. Jonathan Swift. Another author. Writing about another island. HANK: So ""Lemuel"" must be... Nice. Lemuel Gulliver. - We have three different books. - By three different authors. HANK: About three different islands. Maybe... Maybe all three books are about the same island. Maybe that's why nobody else has ever found it... ...because they haven't used the other two books. Treasure Island's got a map. SEAN: Yeah, Swift has one too. These are different than Verne's. I don't get it. What are you doing? You know what I did in the Navy, Sean? No. I won the esteemed... ...Rochefort Award... ...three years in a row... ...for code-breaking. Incredible. HANK: We found your Mysterious Island. Uh, what are those? HANK: Coordinates. Longitude and latitude. And that'll put us right about... ...here. That's miles off the coast of Palau, in the middle of the South Pacific. What are you doing? - I gotta go. - Go where? To Mysterious Island. All right, cool. Hey, can you stop by the moon and grab me a Slurpee? Joke all you want. Yeah, I will, and you're gonna be here to listen to it. You're not going to Palau, Sean. Why not? Number one, you're grounded. On top of that, you got school. I'm a straight-A student. I can afford to miss a couple days. This is Mysterious Island. Slow down. Okay? You think you'll travel... ...around the world... ...meet up with some lunatic... - ...messing around on a ham radio? - It's not some lunatic. It's Alexander Anderson, my grandfather. How would you know he sent that? Makes sense. He's the original Vernian in the family... ...he's been looking for the island half his life and nobody's heard from him in two years. - I think he's in trouble. I'm gonna find him. - Sean, stop. Sean. Stop! I'm not letting you go on a rescue mission by yourself. Whether you like it or not... ...you're still a kid. Look, I understand your situation, okay? You wanna make my mom happy and I appreciate that. I really do. But you need to just focus on running your construction company... ...and paying the mortgage and asking her how her day was... ...because I'm okay. And like it or not, this is bigger than you. Apparently the message was sent by his grandfather. Sean said he's been missing for a couple years. It's hard to be missing if you were never around. I wouldn't trust one word from Alexander Anderson. Sean seems really convinced. Oh, it's always convincing from Alexander. I see. So in Sean's mind, Alexander's this glamorous adventurer. LIZ: When in reality... ...he was a man that wasn't there when his family needed him the most. That's why we need to let Sean... - ...go on this trip. - Why? Sean needs a man in his life. Somebody who'll be there for him and connect with him. We were cracking that code, that was the first time... ...that we were on the same page. Then bond with him on some non-mysterious island, like Hawaii. Ah, Hawaii. Our honeymoon. SINGING Aloha oe Yes, but I'm serious, babe. I'm serious too. We'll fly down to Palau. When Sean realizes the island's not real, his grandfather's not there... ...I'll be there to cushion the blow, and done will be done. PRINTER WHIRRING KNOCKING Good morning, buddy. hours. I'm busy. I don't think you're gonna be too busy for this. I'm going to Palau? Ha, ha. Close. We're going to Palau. What? I know you've won the esteemed Rochefort Award... ...but I've been on these adventures before so let me handle this. Easy, buddy. Just remember who's financing this whole trip. Queen Isabella didn't tag along with Columbus. Okay, Isabella. I'll let you handle your thing. We'll see how... Wait, watch the lizard. Watch. Big man's afraid of a little lizard? Big man's not afraid. I love lizards when they're boots and belts. SEAN: Excuse us. Hi. Hey, how's it going? We, uh... We Americans. Uh, you... ...tour guide? - Sean. - I got this. You... You take us on boat. On water. You wanna charter a boat? The official language of Palau? English. Thank you. Uh, yeah, we need someone to take us to an island located here. Absolutely not. Wait, why? TOUR GUIDE: Because there is no island, just a bunch of storms. It's a graveyard for ships. We'll pay you good money, 1000! Only a fool trades his life for money. Excuse me, excuse me. Today is your lucky day. Hey, I'm Gabato Laguatan, best captain in Palau. I understand you in need of transportation. That's great. We need someone to get us here. A thousand bucks if you can. Ooh, baby! Easy-peasy, easy-peasy. Let's go. Here we go. Let's go. Man, this is gonna be... ...good. You won't be disappointed. I've taken hundreds of people out to sea. I come back with them almost every time. - Nice ride. - Nice ride. GABATO: Thank you, thank you, thank you. HANK: What in the blue heck is that? That's the finest helicopter in Palau. Hate to see the worst. Oh! That's my security system. Heh, heh. - I'd rather take the Titanic. GABATO: Kailani! We have customers here. You simply must meet my daughter. She's a real beauty. Looks just like me. This chopper's not gonna work out. Actually, Hank, you know what? Now that I get a better look at it, this chopper's... ...pretty freaking gorgeous. This daughter looks like you? Look. Same nostrils. - Who are these guys? - Uh... I am a scientific explorer. Hi. And he's a... - Hank. - Hank. Right. So we need to get to these coordinates. Not on this helicopter. That's the deadliest part of the ocean. Time-out. Sweetness, sweetness. Sweetness, look. They agreed to pay us American dollars, okay? I could help with college for you then. Make it 2000. No way. We had a deal. Then make it 3000. And good luck finding someone else to take you there. Please? SIGHS Do you take Visa? GABATO: Good afternoon, folks, and welcome to Gabato Luxury Tours. Please sit back, relax and get ready for the ride of a lifetime. And now a word from our pilot. This is your pilot, and... GABATO SCREAMS HANK: Here we go. GABATO LAUGHING GABATO: Gotcha! If you look out your window on your left... ...you will see what is known... ...as the Pacific Ocean. On your right side, you will see... - ...the other side of the Pacific Ocean. - You gonna do that the whole trip? Sir, you did pay for the luxury tour. GABATO CHUCKLES - It's a beautiful sky, huh? KAILANI: Mm-hm. I mean, today just seems especially... ...majestic. ""Majestic""? Really? - I have to finish this in-flight safety check. - Yeah. SEAN SIGHS THUNDER CRASHING We have to go around the storm. Uh, according to these coordinates, that's where the island is. There is no island there. We're about to find out. GRUNTING RATTLING Whoa. ALL YELLING We gotta get out of here now! I was thinking the same thing! No, no, no. Wait! The Mysterious Island, chapter one! ""The passengers... ...had been taken into... ...the movement of a column of air."" We're about to fly into a Category hurricane! Now's not the time to take the book literally! We have to go into the eye of the hurricane to get to the island! Are you psychotic? We'll never survive! We gotta trust Verne! You know what I trust? Gravity. Gabato, get us out of here now! You're right, I agree with you. But here's the deal: I'm not flying this helicopter any more! The throttle's... ...broken! What? We're going down! Hold on! Here we go! No! Not like this! GABATO SCREAMS SCREAMS GRUNTING ALL YELLING Hang on! Hang on! GASPING HANK: Sean! Sean! Sean! Come on, buddy. Come on. It's okay. It's okay. Try and sit up. Attaboy. I told you it'd work. HANK: You were right. I can't believe we made it. It's Jules Verne, man. You gotta believe. Where are we? Where's my father? GABATO: Somebody help me! Help me! My body's been cut in half! Your foot's right there. My severed foot. And it's moving! It's moving. GABATO GASPS Oh, and I'm still in one piece. Yay. Well, you were right. There is an island. Not much of one. - This is not what I was expecting. HANK: All right, guys, listen up. We have to gather up everything that washed ashore and take stock of our supplies. We need to find shelter. Let's go. BEEPS There you are, baby. I thought I lost you. Oh... Qh, yeah My girl. WIND WHISTLING Hey, I think I found a way off the beach! INSECT CHITTERING What was that? It's a scary noise in a dark cave. Keep moving. Keep moving. Go, go. SEAN CHUCKLING HANK CHUCKLES GABATO: If this is heaven, I'm checking in. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you... The Mysterious Island. KAILANI: What is this place? Whoa! This island, it shrunk us! ALL CHUCKLING ELEPHANT TRUMPETING Or turned us into giants? Sean, what does Verne say about this? It's one of the first laws of island biogeography. Small animals become large and large animals become small. Lilliputian. Swift alluded to it in Gulliver's Travels. I'd like to keep him as a pet. I could knit him a little trunk-warmer. GABATO COOING HANK: See you, buddy. Hey, check it out. You guys see that smoke? - That's gotta be my grandpa's campsite. KAILANI: How do you know? What else could it be? The natives sparking up a barbecue, getting ready to cook us for dinner. Only one way to find out. Whoa, time-out! I hope your grandfather's okay, but my father and I aren't going. - We're headed back to the beach. - To do what? Spell SOS with seashells and maybe kelp. Kelp? There's a boat-eating, plane-eating hurricane out there 247. Nobody's gonna see your kelp. HANK: Sean's absolutely right. We stick together, find his grandfather, use his radio to call for help. Fine. Just know that if we get torn to bits, I'm blaming you. I'm blaming you too. Real smooth. What did I do? Seriously, what did I say? What did I do? SPF 100? You squeeze it and a sweater comes out? Yeah, that's funny, Navy man. Don't come crying to me when you're as red as a tomato. Do I look like I burn? GABATO: Oh, man... ...that's one gooey rock. No one move. These aren't rocks. They're eggs. Get out. Why don't we crack a couple open and make some omelets? Not a good idea. Come on, man, I haven't had breakfast yet. Shh! Where there are giant eggs, there must be a giant mother. LIZARD SNORING It had to be a lizard. Why couldn't it be snakes? SEAN: Okay. Okay, we just need to move quickly but carefully. Lizards have incredible hearing and an acute sense of smell. SNIFFS Uh-oh. Let's move. Just move. We are literally walking on eggshells. Ooh! Guys? Don't take another step. Papa, be careful. Don't worry, honey. I got this. See? No problem. Oh! Oh, man! PANTING SCREAMING LIZARD GROWLING LIZARD ROARING Run, run, run! Head for the jungle! Faster! Faster! Let's go! Go! Go! Move! Come on! This Way! Let's go! KAILANI  GABATO SCREAM GABATO: Go, go, go! Move! HANK: It's right behind you! Hurry! KAILANI: Come on! Sean! KAILANI SCREAMS SEAN: Hey, Godzilla! Oh, crap. Oh, man! GABATO: Oh, go, go, go! LIZARD GROWLING SEAN GRUNTS Come on, come on! - Come on, keep moving! - Hurry! LIZARD GROWLING HANK: Back! Back! Back! Sean, get behind me. Sean, backpack! Back! Back! - Hank! Hank! HANK: Back! Not now, Sean. She's scared! No, she's cold-blooded and attracted to heat! That's emasculating. Now what? Now there's only one thing left. The thunder cookie. HANK GRUNTS I think I just made it worse. ROARING GABATO: Whoa! KAILANI: Aah! Hope she doesn't like Polynesian food. I hope she don't like food with poop in its pants! GABATO WHIMPERING MAN WHOOPING Go, go, go! SCREAMS GRUNTS COUGHING Everybody okay? Yeah. MAN LAUGHING Well, don't just stand there. Applaud! Grandpa! That was amazing. A pitch-perfect frill-necked lizard mating call. They fall for it all the time. Gabato and Kailani. - Their helicopter brought us here. - Pleasure. Pleasure. And I'm Sean's stepfather, Hank Parsons. I helped Sean crack your code. ALEXANDER: You're the stepfather? Well, maybe that's why it took so long, eh? SEAN LAUGHS After all, how hard can it be to crack a code... ...by converting a string of Vernian characters into a list of dots and dashes. Or you could have just sent a message not in code. There it is, definitive proof that you are not an Anderson. SEAN: Mm-hm. Ooh. Ooh! LIZARD SNORES I think it's best we get out of here. After that mating call, she may have ideas about making you her husband. Oh, witty. Good for you, Henry. LAUGHS The name's Hank. It's never Henry. Just Hank. Ah. I see you're a man of incisive decision. Why don't you lead the way? Oh, actually... ...we want to live through the night. Yes. So maybe you should all... ...follow me. Come on. Hank? I'm following you. All right, come on. Go ahead. ANIMAL ROARS IN DISTANCE That's awesome. Here we are, folks. Come on up. This is my place. Wow. ALEXANDER: Welcome. We've got a working elevator, indoor plumbing. And I've even got... ...a 75-inch... ...HDTV. How'd you build all this stuff? I made it out of the sailboat that brought me here. Old Blue-Eyed Lucy. She gave her life in that hurricane so that I could discover... ...the ever-glorious... ...Mysterious Island. Smoothie? Oh, thank you. This the radio you used to send the signal? Yes. I made it myself... ...out of an alarm clock... ...some copper I mined in the hills over there and a teaspoon. You know how long it took me to make it? Oh, I don't know. Probably a little less than... ...who cares? Three months. You know how long... ...it would've taken you? Ooh... Forever. Ha-ha-ha! KAILANI: Let's just contact... ...Palau, get off this island. It's not that easy, darling. You have to wait for the satellite... ...to come around to the proper position. How long's that gonna take? Oh, about two weeks. Wait, do you mean we're stuck here for two weeks? ""Stuck here""? I think it'll be fun. We can get to know each other better. KAILANI SCOFFS Surviving here won't be fun. How will your mom feel if we're off the grid for two weeks? By the time you get back, she's probably gonna be remarried. GABATO GASPS You gonna let him talk to you like that? It's okay. HANK CHUCKLES Okay, so, what's the plan, Colonel Sanders? How about you show us more of your trinkets... ...that won't get us off this island? Anyone else thinking about the eggs hatching? If you're afraid of a few critters, maybe you shouldn't have come, Henry. It is called the Mysterious Island. Should've expected mysterious things. It's right in the title. HANK: I know what the book says. You wanted to find Mysterious Island. Mission accomplished. You wanted to find your grandmother. Mission accomplished. At daybreak we're out of here. And for the last time, it's Hank. What's the hurry? Tomorrow, I am gonna show you a place... ...that will take your breath away. Like forever? You're all gonna find out. So let's get some shut-eye. It's a big day tomorrow. Good nighty, honey. - Good night, Papa. - Good nighty. PANTING Hey, how's it going? Well, apart from you stranding us on this stupid island, just fine. Good. Good. So, hey, I was thinking, you know, sometime we could hang out or something... ...if you wanted to. I have a feeling that your idea of fun and my idea of fun are two very different things. What do you like doing on the weekends? Collect and label mollusks. No way! Me too. I'm way into mollusks. - Really? - Yeah. Well, which one's your favorite? Mine's the Mxyzptlk snail. You're not gonna believe me, but that's my favorite too. I just made that up. Mxyzptlk isn't a snail. It's one of Superman's archenemies. SIGHS Way to slay the heart. - Whatever. - Getting the attention of a woman... ...is one of the hardest things to do. All right. So, what do I do, Casanova? HANK SIGHS I been waiting a long time to have this talk with you, buddy. There are three things to know about understanding girls. Number one: Don't follow your instincts. Any other area in life... ...instincts will get you there. Not with women. So whatever you think you should do, do the opposite. Number two: You need to be open, sensitive. Women don't want a man just because he's big and strong and has abs like mine. No. They want a thinker, they want a feeler. They want someone who can understand them. Women want a man who is in touch with his most inner emotions. And the third thing is the most important. It's something that women have responded to for thousands of years. Well, tell me. You have got to do this. What is that? That is the pec pop of love. Now go on and throw a berry. - No. - Throw a berry. There's some behind you. Grab one and throw it. Don't be afraid, they're not gonna bite. Boom. HANK CHUCKLES Go ahead, grab a bunch. Rapid-fire, now. I'm not doing rapid-fire. They will not stop until you feed them. Feed them? No. They're hungry. I'll feed them. Attaboy. Get some. Okay, you ready? Ready? Here we go. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Stop. Ready? This one's special. Make this one count. Mmm. No way, that's awesome. Stop encouraging him. It's a gift. - It is a gift. - He has a gift. Sean, it works every time. CHUCKLING Come on, Gabby. Get a move on. Where's he going? I don't know, but if this goes on much longer, he'll blow a hip. Come on. Oh! I'm going. Come on, come on. We're almost there. Get ready, Gabby. I'm about to take your breath away. GABATO: Wow! Unbelievable. ALEXANDER LAUGHS ALEXANDER: How do you like Grandma now? GABATO: Hello! ALEXANDER: No one's been home for thousands of years, Gabby. Can anybody guess... ...what all this is? Do you know? Do you know? Legoland? No. SEAN: Well, that's Poseidon. - Can you move this? HANK: Yeah. Atlantis. I can't believe it. We're standing in the lost city of Atlantis. ALEXANDER: The same Atlantis that Verne wrote about, down to the last detail. But wasn't Atlantis underwater? Oh, when Verne wrote about it, it was, but it has a 140-year cycle... ...and spends half its time above the water. - What about the other half? SEAN: It's called tectonic recurrence. The ocean bed buckles due to volcanic activity... ...pulling land to the surface. Then the entire island sinks back to the bottom of the sea. SEAN: Nobody's ever seen it on this big of a scale. This is amazing. Come with me. I've been looking for this piece of paradise for years. I promised your old man that we'd find it together. But he's not here to enjoy it... ...so I made sure that his son would be. That is why I encoded that message. I wanted an Anderson to see this place... ...before anyone else. Some men get to put their names on stars, species... ...plants. We get to put our name... ...on this gorgeous island. In two weeks, we'll contact the authorities to pick us up... ...and in three weeks, we'll be on the cover of TIME magazine. Guys. We got a problem. What? You see this? It's saltwater. The only way saltwater gets this far inland is if it enters the subsoil from below. So...? This island's about to go under. The only saltwater here is on your brain. I've analyzed the samples... ...and I've calculated the numbers. This island isn't due to sink for years. Alexander, your numbers are wrong. - And how would you know that? HANK: I've come across this... ...as we build over runoff areas. It's called soil liquefaction. Look, you can see it in the cracks in the confining beds all along here, along here... ...over there, back here. ALEXANDER: Okay, you made your point. GABATO: Well, how long do we have? If I had to guess, based on all this water... ...two, three days max. Then what? Because I ain't no flotation device, man. You will be, we don't figure this out. There must be some way off this island. GABATO: We could build a boat. HANK: The storm around this island will chew it up, spit it out. I've got something. What about the Nautilus? How is an exercise machine gonna help us get out of here? No, no, the Nautilus. Captain Nemo's submarine, built in 1870. ALEXANDER: Well done, Sean. Chapter 16, Verne wrote it is hidden on the island. If we can make it there in time, we can ride it under the hurricane back to Palau. HANK: Okay. One question: Where is it? There's only one man who can tell us that... ...and that is Captain Nemo himself. The Dakkar Grotto. The final resting place of Captain Nemo. Legend has it his crew buried him there. I'll tell you what had better be in there: Nemo's journal. It could tell us the location of the Nautilus. I've never been able to crawl in there on my own. Too many fried eggs, I'm afraid. ALEXANDER CHUCKLES I'll go. I'm the only one who can fit. No way. It's too dangerous. Sweet, but I don't need your permission. GABATO: Honey? - Papa loves you. - You remember the drill. Be careful. Who knows what's down there. KAILANI SCREAMS Honey? Honey? You okay?! I'm fine. I'm inside! SCREECHES RUMBLING What was that? So that's what a sinking island sounds like. Hank! Hank! Hurry! GABATO: Pull her out! Pull her out! COUGHING SEAN: Hi. GABATO: Man, that guy had some terrible handwriting. - Looks like Sanskrit. - Close. It's Hindi. Yeah, Nemo's from India. It says here... ...that the Nautilus is in a basalt... ...cave on the other side of the island, just... ...under Poseidon's Cliffs. I know... ...this place. That's where we gotta go. What's the best way there? Well, now, that depends. The safest way is around the shoreline... ...but the fastest way is across the heart of the island. What do you think, Hank? - I think we got no choice. The quickest way. - He's right. - I'm in. ALEXANDER: Yeah, but... ...let me warn you. The heart of this island... ...is full of jagged mountains, dark jungles and terrifying creatures... ...who will give you nightmares. So... ...who's up for an adventure? LAUGHS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY INSECT SCREECHING GABATO: Are we there yet? ALEXANDER: We get there when we get there, Gabby. RUMBLING SEAN: What was that? The tectonic plates are starting to pull apart underneath the island. We gotta move. Let's go. Move. Move. Wait, what is that? Volcanic ash? It looks like... ALEXANDER: Gold. Pure gold. The treasure Stevenson... talked about in Treasure Island. Volcanoes are made of what they erupt. So if that thing's erupting gold, then it's... A mountain of gold. SEAN: Must be massive gold deposits. Let's go check it out. Hold on. That'll take us days out of our way. We don't have the time. Let's make the time. Volcanic gold? That's a huge scientific breakthrough. I understand, but we gotta get to the Nautilus. Hank, I'm not just a little kid. Okay? I get a say in this too. Sean, I am responsible for you. I'd never take a chance with your life. Hey, hey, you can't tell him what to do. - You're not his father. HANK: From what I hear... ...you haven't been much of a grandfather. I have given him something to live up to. Science, adventure, wonder. What have you ever given him? I've given him a lot of things, a sense of responsibility being one of them. Something clearly you don't have. You're not going. We're getting out of here. End of discussion. Sean, please. We have to get off this island. GABATO: Bye-bye, gold. Hey, you okay? Yeah. Fine. It's just, you know, I don't need Hank trying to tell me what to do all the time. My dad's always trying to get involved too, but he usually ends up embarrassing me. Yeah? How? Last summer I was trying to get a job... ...so he flew all over Palau dropping thousands of copies of my resume from his helicopter. That's embarrassing. Isn't that the worst when they try so hard? No. I mean, the worst would be if they didn't try at all. Alexander, are you sure your compass readings are correct? - Of course I am. Why? - Why? Because we're down here... ...and we need to be all the way up there. ALEXANDER: To every problem, there is... ...a solution, my large friend... ...and I think this might be a fun one. IMITATING ALEXANDER You think this might be a fun one, eh? IN NORMAL VOICE Does anybody have an umbrella? Because Mary Poppins is gonna fly us up to the top of the cliff. I knew you'd be good for something. Better wait here, Henry. CHUCKLES Where's he going? I don't know, but that guy's out of his mind. ALEXANDER: Whoa! Ha, ha! Oh, I most certainly am. It turns out that mounting the bee is easy if you don't look into its eyes. That is so sick. Okay. You get down now. Why would I get down? Well, because Medicare doesn't cover old ladies falling off of giant bees. Get down. Suit yourself. But make sure you're wearing swimming trunks when this place becomes the Pacific Ocean. Whoa! Ha-ha-ha! SIGHS Sean. KAILANI LAUGHS Can we fly together? This is amazing! Like riding stallions across the Serengeti. ALEXANDER LAUGHS This is beautiful! Talk about paradise! LAUGHING Oh, man. - Is that...? - Bird poop? Uh! Oh! That must be one giant... BIRD SCREECHES Bird! HANK: Into the trees! GABATO WH I MPERS BIRD CHIRPING That thing looks hungry! A white-throated needletail. It feeds on worms, aphids... ...and, yes, bees! SEAN  KAILANI GASP There's another one! BIRDS CHIRPING Hold on! Watch out! ALEXANDER: Hey! Stay in your own lane! HANK: Are you familiar with Chicken? ALEXANDER: These aren't chickens! HANK: No, the game! Chicken! GABATO: Oh! I like the way he thinks. Charge! Not yet. Not yet! CHUCKLES Now! GABATO: Oh! HANK LAUGHS Yeah! How cool was that, little buddy? I love you, Hank! I love you so much! I love you... Too much happy. That's too much happy. SEAN: Hold on! KAILANI SCREAMS KAILANI SCREAMS Kailani! SCREAMING KAILANI GRUNTS SEAN GRUNTS You saved me. Yeah, I guess I did. BIRD CHIRPING Or maybe not! Go, go! Get out of here! Sean, what are you doing? Come on, bird! Let's do this! Yes! Aah! GRUNTING SCREAMS SEAN GRUNTING Sean. Talk to me. It's my ankle. I can't move it. This could be serious. I need to look at it. Not here. This part of town is even more dangerous after dark. Okay. I'm gonna get you up, on three. One, two, three. Up. That's it. ALEXANDER: Give me your arm. Okay. HANK: Now come on. Has the swelling gone down? It's dislocated pretty bad. We might be here a while. Well, we'll go get some water. We're gonna have to pop it back in, buddy. Okay. Let's do it. Alexander, I'll brace him. You do it on three? Got it. - Ready? - Yeah. One... SEAN: Aah! - What happened to two and three? - Yeah. Two, three. Wasn't so bad. It wasn't very good. Do we have anything for the pain? There's nothing in here. All right, buddy. There you go. Okay. Attaboy. We have this. No, no, no. Don't worry. I don't sing to dudes underneath the stars in front of a cozy fire. - It's not my style. - Good. You can sing? A little bit. Brilliant. Music is nature's painkiller. Sing him a song. - No. ALEXANDER: Yeah. Come on. Come on. Okay. Don't worry. I got something special for you. HANK CHUCKLES SEAN: God! HANK: All right. UKULELE TUNING Oh, that's gonna make me feel better? Slow it down. Just gotta get in tune. Takes a big man to play a little guitar. And an even bigger one to listen. ALEXANDER LAUGHS HANK SINGING: I see trees of green Red roses too I see them bloom For me and for you And I think to Myself What a wonderful world I see giant bees and I could have told ya Don't trust Alexander He's older than Yoda And I think To myself What a wonderful world The island That we stand on Well, it's currently sinking Sending those secret codes What the heck were you drinking? But it's All in the past We wiped the slate clean We're going to find Nemo 's Submarine And you'll think to yourself What a wonderful World Oh, yeah Oh, that was extraordinary. What, my multiple talents? No, after all these years, finding the elusive singing Sasquatch. ALL LAUGHING No, but seriously, where'd you learn to play like that? My dad used to sing it to me when I was a kid. Ah. Remind me to buy him a drink when we get back. Yeah. Good luck finding him. Why? Where is he? Don't know. He left when I was 8, and I haven't seen him since. At least I got a good song out of it, right? Yeah. You like him, don't you? Who, Sean? No. Yeah, he's a little hotheaded, you know. But he seems to be a good kid. It can never happen between us. I mean, if we get off this island, he'll go back to America... ...move on with his life and go to college. And I'll go back to tiny Palau. You could go to college someday if that's something you really want. Who's gonna help you at work? Plus we can't afford it. Don't say that. You wanna go to college, you can go to college. Okay? I can make that happen. I promise. Thanks, Papa. THUNDER CRASHING Hank. Hank, get up. Something's wrong here. Everybody up! Where'd this water come from? The liquefaction rate tripled overnight. What's that mean? It's sinking a lot faster than we thought. I thought you said a couple of days. - Now more like a couple of hours. - A couple of hours? We need to get to that sub or we'll all be 20,000 leagues under the sea. KAILANI: Papa? Papa? Papa? Papa! - He's gone. ALEXANDER: Stay calm. He's probably gone for a pee. Oh, no. Oh, no. SEAN: What? Ugh. Last night, he promised me he'd send me to college. Now I know what he meant. He's going after the mountain of gold. Look, I gotta go get him. You guys head to the sub. If we're not there in time, leave without us. No way. You're not going alone. I'll go with you. You have a dislocated ankle, that's four miles. It's fine. I can do it. It'll be okay. No, Sean, he's right. You're in no condition to make that trip. Well, she can't go alone. Then I'll go with her. I'm the one who... ...called you to this island. It's my fault you're in this quagmire. If this map of ours is right... ...then the Trident Cliffs should be about... ...a mile and a half in that direction. You get to the Nautilus as soon as you can and then meet us... - ...on the shoreline. - We have one map. HANK: Let me see your phone. Let me see this thing. CAMERA CLICKS Now we have two. Hank, well done. Thank you... ...for calling me Hank. Anytime. Be careful. ALEXANDER: Come on, darling. I'll see you soon. I promise. Ready, Sean? Yeah. Come on. GASPS GRUNTING Ow! Ooh! Oh, not that there! Ow! That hurt too! COUGHING GASPS Gold. Our prayers have been answered. GRUNTING LAUGHING There's Poseidon's... ...Trident, right where it's supposed to be. We need the cliff. This is just shoreline. The Nautilus is supposed to be inside of a cave right here. Maybe the map is wrong. Let me see it. Sean, we are in the right place. Well, then where's the cave? Where's the Nautilus? Down there. The sea level's risen over feet in the last hours. I can't believe this is happening. We're too late. It's over. No, it's not. It's okay. It's okay. We just gotta think. We just gotta think of a way to get... I got it. - What? - Scuba tanks. Are we listing things that we don't have? Okay, a jet pack, a girlfriend, calligraphy paper. No, no, listen to me. We just... ""Calligraphy paper""? It popped into my head. - We have a couple of dry bags, right? - Yeah. Okay, so we take what we salvaged from the beach, and we build makeshift scuba tanks. No short breaths... ...no wasted movements. Make sure you equalize ear pressure as you go down. You know... ...if we die down there... ...Mom's gonna kill us. Then let's do this. GABATO GRUNTING GRUNTING KAILANI: Papa? Papa. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be back at the Nautilus. I'll meet you... ...back there. Papa, stop. Stop. Papa, stop! Baby, this is our one chance. Our one chance to send you to college. To give you a different life, a better life. Papa. We'll have all the wealth we'll ever need... ...just as long as we're together. Let's go home. All right. All right. Okay. ALEXANDER: Double-time, Gabby. THUNDER CRASHING Okay, it's only feet down, and we've got two hits of air with this. Right. - Are you ready? - Am I ready? Are you ready? - Oh, I'm totally ready. - Well, I'm totally ready. Well, I'm probably more ready than you. No, there's no way. I'm, like, twice as ready as you are. We're procrastinating out of fear, aren't we? - Oh, absolutely. - Yeah. Wait, which way are you going? Frankly, I'm not sure. You're not sure? Look, we're running out of time. Well, which Way's north? ALEXANDER: Uh... This way. No. No. No, that's not it. It's this way. We're getting too much magnetic friction. What does that mean? It means we're lost. METAL GROANING ELECTRICITY CRACKLING GASPING GASPING AND COUGHING We made it. The Nautilus. Come on. Sean, give me the flashlight. Let's power this up and get to the others. KAILANI: How do we find north without a compass? Spiders. GABATO: Oh, oh... Heh, heh. I already rode a giant bee. I ain't getting on no spider. Spiders build their webs... ...facing south. Uh, guys? I think I found our spider. GABATO: Oh! And we go the other way. The ballast control panel's gotta be around here somewhere. Where's the power switch? I think this is it. How do you know? It's right there in chapter 17. Someone's reading their Verne. Let's fire this baby up. ENGINE WHIRRING Come on, come on. Wake up! ENGINE SPUTTERS SIGHS The engine's dead. We gotta get under the hood. HANK: These batteries are years old. It's gonna need a jump-start. Yeah, but that's gonna take thousands of kilowatts of electricity. ELECTRICITY CRACKLING You thinking what I'm thinking? That's completely insane. Exactly. - Cable attached to the harpoon? - Yeah. Great. One good charge from that thing out there, we're gonna be on our way. Okay. But I need you to come back. Of course. Somebody's gotta help you pilot this thing. No, I mean... Look, if anybody ever asks, I'm gonna deny that I ever said this. But I need you to come back. I've had a lot of people take off on me in my life... ...and I don't want you to be one of them. Before we left, I told your mom that I was gonna take care of her son. You're not just her son. You're my family too now. I promise you I'll come back for you. Okay? Okay. Now... ...who's up for an adventure? THUNDER CRASHING Where are they? They're not here. RUMBLING ALL GRUNTING GABATO: Bumpy! WHIMPERING They'd better get here quick! We're running out of real estate! Hey! Hey, over here! Where are you? Where are you? HANK GRUNTING Come on, Hank. Come on! HANK: Where are you? Come on, show me... ...that 1000-watt smile. Do it now! YELLS Yes! ENGINE WHIRRING KAILANI: I love you, Papa. I love you, baby. SOBBING Down we go! ALL SCREAM We made it. Not yet, we haven't! ALL GRUNTING Up ahead. We're gonna be blocked. Gabato, I need you to captain us out of here. Me? You brought us to the island, you can take us back. GABATO: Okay. Sean, on my signal, hit that button. Yeah, you right. It's like flying in my helicopter. Like... Okay. GRUNTING ALEXANDER: Hank! Hank! Fire it! SEAN GRUNTING ALL GRUNTING Hey, hey, man, we did it! We did it! Yes! GABATO: Yeah! - Yeah! SEAN: Yes! - Yeah! LAUGHING Gabato! And we're on cruise control. Nice work, man. You too. Can't believe we made it off the island. Yeah. WHISPERING Pop your pecs. WHISPERING I'm not gonna pop my pecs. Now's the time. She's gonna love it, believe me. - I'm not gonna pop pecs. - Do it, do it. You can do it. She would love it, believe me. KAILANI: Ahem. You two done yet? POP your pecs. Thank you. For everything. IN NORMAL VOICE That works too. I'm so happy right now. I don't know how... ...this moment could get better. ALEXANDER: Well, the one way... ...it could get better is if you steer us away from this coral reef. GABATO: Oh! Oh! Okay. That's a good idea, good idea. Good afternoon, folks... ...and welcome to Gabato Luxury Tours. If you look out the window on your left... ...you will see what is known as the Pacific Ocean. HANK: Ugh. Here we go again. BOY 1: Pass it! BOY 2: Car! BOY 3: Game on! CELL PHONE RINGING For the third time today, Papa, I'm fine. Yeah, but I heard there was a 2.3 magnitude earthquake in Ojai. Is that anywhere near Ohio? It's miles away. You don't need to worry about any earthquakes. - What about volcanoes? - No. Giant birds? Goodbye, Papa. I love you. I love you, sweetness. Hey, can you wish Sean a happy birthday for me? And maybe I'll call you later. Say, in five minutes? - Bye, Papa. - I love you, baby. Bye. Okay, are we ready for the journey?! CROWD CHEERING GABATO: Whoo! Yeah! Yeah! KAILANI: Hello. Hey, guys. I'm sorry I'm late. - Hey, darling. - Hey. - You look wonderful. - Good to see you. - Come here for a second. KAILANI: Okay. - Happy birthday. - You raised a great man. - No. KAILANI: So sorry I'm late. We are raising a great man. Open this one first. Postmarked Cameroon? Oh, it's from Grandpa. He wants to give me... ...his present next time he sees me. MOTORCYCLE APPROACHES HANK CHUCKLES DOOR OPENS Well, don't just sit there. Applaud! Grandpa! ALL LAUGHING ALEXANDER: Hi. KAILANI: Hey. Can't believe you're here. I wouldn't miss your birthday for the world. I wanted to give you this. A book? Oh, it's not just a book. It's a trip I want us to go on. All of us, as a family. From the Earth to the Moon. What do you say? Well, I think there's only one thing to say. - So who's up for an adventure? LIZ: No, no, no! HANK: Oh, honey, what could possibly go wrong? It's only the moon. English - US - SDH"

She is also close friends with Kobe (Connor Paolo) and is dating Tyler (William Moseley).
Laura receives a friend request from a student at her campus, Marina Mills. Seeing her talents in animation, she accepts the request and begins a friendship with the lonely girl. However she soon notices that Marina's Facebook profile is plastered in bizarre and disturbing images and her obsessive behavior begins to make Laura feel uncomfortable. When Laura shares pictures of herself at her birthday dinner – to which Marina was not invited – Marina publicly and angrily confronts her at her college campus. During the quarrel, Laura accidentally pushes Marina and her hat falls off, revealing her bald spot, a result of trichotillomania, causing Marina to run away. Laura notices Marina's several comments, who tries to apologize to her, Laura eventually unfriends Marina on Facebook. Seeing her number of friends once again down to zero, a heartbroken Marina angrily closes her laptop. That night, Laura notices a black mirror, which shows a forest where a dark figure is seen walking. As Laura is staring at it, a terrifying demonic face appears behind her, but quickly disappears when Olivia turns on the light. In the next morning, teacher reveals that Marina has committed suicide, much to Laura's astonishment.
Another night, Marina uploads a video, showing she burns the drawing of Laura and commits suicide by hanging herself, terrifying Laura.
The next morning, Laura receives a message from Marina containing the video of her suicide. Later on, it is posted to her Facebook page. Laura is unable to remove the video, and her friend count drops. Left with no choice, she tries to delete her account, but an unknown error occurs. Realizing that she is being stalked, Laura goes to Kobe's apartment for help. When Kobe and Laura investigate Marina's Facebook page, they realize that the source code where it has been written is not the normal code.
That night, Marina adds Gustavo as a friend and posts a distorted picture of his face. The lights suddenly cut off, he is then terrorized by a spirit, while seeing things that were posted on Marina's page. Gustavo rushes into the elevator for safety, only to be attacked by a swarm of wasps; as the elevator doors opens, he is seen smashing his face against the elevator walls by an unseen force, and is discovered by Isabelle, who was sent to a hospital and begins to blame Laura for Gustavo's death.
The recorded video of the elevator attack is posted on Laura's Facebook page. Her friends subsequently turn against her by posting angry and disgusted comments, effectively making her an outcast. Laura attempts to text her friends that she didn't, but to her confusion, the texts suddenly changes to ""u will know what it feels like to be lonely :)"". Laura goes to the orphanage where she meets the woman, who reveals that Marina's real last name is Nedifar; Marina was ruthlessly bullied and tormented by the boys when she was seven-years old. However, they were murdered by an unknown assailant. Meanwhile, Kobe is looking for the black mirror on a website. Suddenly, several faces of Marina appear on the monitors as the lights begin flickering, but everything quickly reverts when the janitor arrives.
A devastated Isabelle is going through pictures on her phone, she begins hallucinating and notices the burnt body of a woman and rushes to get help but finds that nobody is there. Horrified after seeing the two boys with their mutilated faces coming toward her, she rushes into the bathroom and locks herself. To make matters worse, she finds the body of herself before being killed by Marina. Laura goes with Detective Cameron and his officer to watch the recorded footage of Isabelle which showed that the hospital staff were there revealing that she was hallucinating and slits her own throat out of madness, controlled by Marina. The footage was later posted on Laura's Facebook page. Tyler, Kobe and Olivia are unable to delete the videos, unfriend Laura or deactivate their account as unknown errors keep occurring, Laura's Facebook friend count continues to drop, while Tyler is looking the address of Marina's home. Olivia separated with Laura and moved out, fearing that she would share the same fate as Gustavo and Isabelle. Later, Laura notices the picture of Olivia from Marina's page, the picture slowly melts, implying that she is next. Laura attempts to call her, but Olivia has turned off her phone, alongside laptop. Olivia is attacked by Marina with wasps and taken into the hospital. When Tyler and Detective Cameron are talking, Marina possesses Olivia through the heart monitor and lunges at detective Cameron's partner, taking the gun from him. Instead of shooting the officer, she shoots herself in the head, killing Olivia.
Meanwhile, Laura hunts down the place where Marina committed suicide in order to destroy the black mirror that turned Marina into an evil spirit, she and Kobe go to Marina's house which was burnt down and attempt to look for her. While there, Kobe sees an ethereal entity come out of the basement and approaches him, but disappears when Laura bumps into him. Laura tells him that Marina is not there, but he suggests that they look in the basement.
Marina is not found in the basement, but while searching, Kobe is separated from Laura, who finds him staring into a black mirror. When she turns him around and asks what's wrong, he apologizes to Laura and says that she can't be lonely if she died. Kobe suddenly stabs her in the stomach, hoping to kill her in order to save himself and Tyler. Laura hits him with her flashlight and escapes from the basement as Kobe gives the chase but loses her. Laura then realizes through one of Marina's posts that Marina committed suicide in one of the nearby factories.
Meanwhile, Tyler finds a deranged Kobe looking for Laura. After getting a call, Tyler and Kobe head to the factories as well, but he tells Kobe to stay in the car while he tried to find Laura. Once getting to the factories, a wounded Laura starts looking for Marina's body, she receives a video call from her mother, Caroline, who informs that she's been seeing Marina too. Laura's video call begins to glitch out as her mother begins to act strangely, a sign that she may be attacked by Marina. Caroline takes a knife from the table and goes to the other room, presumably killing herself as the connection times out. Devastated by her mother's presumed death, Laura begins to cry after seeing everyone she's loved being taken away. Tyler soon finds her, only their reunion is cut short when Kobe appears and stabs Tyler in the throat, killing him. Laura attempts to escape Kobe once again but reaches a dead end. However, before he can kill Laura, Kobe is violently attacked and killed by the pack of wasps.
Laura, feeling dazed, sees an apparition of two boys (presumably the boys that bullied Marina in the orphanage). Laura yells at Marina, asking what she wants from her, the spirit of younger Marina appears and says that she wanted to be best friends with her as she leads Laura to Marina's rotten corpse and her laptop which transports Laura into one of Marina's earlier posts. Laura is then lunged at by a demonic Marina.
Some time has passed and there are fresh batch of students. Laura is seen looking at some girls in the same way that Marina looked at Laura and her friends in the beginning. Laura then faces her laptop (which actually is Marina's laptop) and is shown to have zero friends, just like Marina before she met Laura. Then her new account  – which shares the same dark, grotesque images and renamed as Lau Ra –  is revealed. The camera shows Laura's eyes are green and blue, implying that Marina has possessed Laura.",5.2,tt3352390,"Everyone, please. Please. It's my unfortunate responsibility to share with you some terrible news. It seems that over the weekend, your fellow student, Marina Mills, committed suicide. Is it true that she filmed it on her webcam? One of your classmates died and all you care about is whether you can see it? Apparently there was a video uploaded to the university website this morning. Some of you were crafty enough to grab it before we could take it down. I urge you not to... To watch it. Anyone caught sharing it will be suspended. Period. No discussion. Were any of you friends with Marina? Or have any info that can shed light on this tragedy? Well, if so, see me after class. Liv, this video's so cute! - So not scared. - Yeah, right. So good. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. Hey. - Hello. - Someone didn't come home last night. - Yeah, again. So are you guys, like, monogamous now or what? - Liv, it's not a dirty word. Jesus. - I know. Clearly, I'm just jealous, you know, being dumped. You were not dumped. You knew him for one day. It was an amazing day. Mmm, yeah. Yeah, I like that. Yeah. - Eww! - Oh, my God. - It's disgusting... - Oh, no. So you're in a... In a relationship? Oh, here we go. No, it's super cool, it really is. I just, you know, love all these precious little updates about you and Doctor Surfboard. - Good for you. - Oh, shut up. What do I look like? I'm a sophisticated lady. Wine and dine me. Another argument that Internet Addiction Disorder doesn't belong in the DSM is that it's frequently symptomatic of other disorders, depression, anxiety, trauma. Often, it's an escape from things we don't wanna deal with, from our everyday lives... ...to things far, far worse. Though the most common disorder might just be that we have too much time on our hands... Play it cool. - Wait a few days. - He already knows I'm not cool. I think we might have an excellent example of Internet Addiction Disorder right here in class. Aside from Miss Woodson and Miss Mathison, does anyone else here experience symptoms? - Look at that. That's a nice one. - I love it. Oh, I really like that filter. - I can show you how to do it. - Look at Kobe. Jesus. When's he gonna get over you? Such a creeper. - He is not a creeper. - Ooh. Who's that? A girl in my class. Zero friends. How is that not, like, super weird? Maybe she just started her profile or something. Is she, like, 12-years-old? Huh. I think she's really talented. I like it. You like it when she rips her hair out during class? Oh, come on. Dude, I literally saw her pull an eyelash out today. No. It's a condition. It's called trichotillomania. You would know all about it if you cracked open a textbook every once in a while. - Owned! - Oh, whatever. I'm actually changing majors next year. Oh, yeah? And the year after that? - Owned! - Come on. - Twofer. - Whatever. What you making? Is that seafood curry? - That looks good. - What? Seafood curry? No, this is paella... Well, my dad was a psychiatrist, so I guess I, you know, - wanna follow in his footsteps. - That's nice. Mmm. Are you doing it for credit or are you just... You really wanna do it? I'm not sure. I just transferred. - I... I don't know anyone yet. - Well, now you know me. Are you in the dorms? My friends and I, we just got an apartment. It's amazing, but we're definitely not getting any work done. - Too many friends. - Exactly. I'll see you around campus. Bye, Laura. Hmm. I thought med students had homework. You're one to talk. What? I'm studying. Internet Addiction Disorder. - And you're your own case study. - Exactly. What's the deal with this girl? I don't know. I think she's lonely. She gonna be your friend or your first mental patient? She'd be my second mental patient. She's going through every post I've ever made in my life. Oh, whoa. She's crazy. Look what she just sent me. Wait, I wanna see. Oh. Really, you guys are gonna live happily ever after together. - Oh, my God. - Nice. Who is this person? I don't know. Dude, scroll down. I wanna see her timeline. Further. Further. Whoa. Jesus. No wonder this girl's giving you nightmares. Jesus. - OK. - Oh, my God. Laura, this girl isn't right. Why are you hanging out with her? I was just trying to be nice. God, I can't believe you invited her to your birthday. No, no, no, no, I didn't invite her. She invited herself. What was I supposed to say? Erm, how about something like ""Fuck, no""? - Yeah, that sounds about right to me. - You can't say that to someone. - Oh, yeah, it goes like this. - Yes, you can. It goes like this. ""Hey, Laura, can I come to your birthday?"" ""Fuck, no."" There you go. Laura, finally. Happy birthday. You look so pretty. - Thanks, Marina. - You get my messages? Yeah. How can I miss them? Are you mad at me? Did I do something wrong? No, I'm not mad at you. I'm just... - I'll see you in class tomorrow, OK? - But what about tonight? Aren't you celebrating with your friends? Er... It's just Tyler and I tonight. We're going out to dinner, so just the two of us. But you barely know her. Isn't tonight just you and your friends? I know, I know. I just feel, you know, icky lying about it. Well, you don't look very icky to me. Mmm! All right, go ahead. Hi. Hey. Hi, Mom. - Hey, happy birthday. - Hey. I've been trying to get your mom as drunk as possible. You, beautiful guy, you need to get drunk immediately so we know what you're made of. Happy birthday! This is gonna be... A good time... Yeah! Yeah, it's literally her! That was our inspiration. And the last reason, no matter what, that you always find some crazy way to make me feel better. Aww. Wait, wait, wait, to my little green bean who makes me so proud every day, and who made her father so proud every single second. Oh, Mom. All right, I'm gettin' in, I'm jumping in this little love boat. - No, I'm going, I'm going, OK? - Oh, no. Er... This is... This is to us. A wonderful evening. To the future, to success. And you shut up, you drunk floozy. And then, this is also to, just to you, to happy birthday. - Thanks, guys. - Cheers. - Hey, Laura. How are you doing? - Hey. How are you? - Good. Good. - That's good. I thought we were friends. Marina, what are you, what are you talking about? I saw you with everyone. Your birthday dinner. I saw it. Marina, I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Can we talk about this later? OK? I had a present for you. I worked on it for two weeks. Two weeks? You've barely known me for two weeks. You're a fucking liar just like everyone else! Why did you accept my friendship? You didn't have to do that! Get off me. You have any idea how it feels to be alone? Completely alone? Get off me, you freak! Oh, God. Laura, you didn't do anything wrong. This chick is just damaged. You weren't there, Tyler. It's not your fault. Baby, I'm really sorry, I gotta get back to cutting up dead people. OK. She's trying to face-chat me. What do I do? Don't take the call. - Seriously. - Fine, all right. I'll talk to you later. OK. Bye. Liv? Hmm. Are you OK? Go to bed. Remind me after class to tell you a story. Please. Everyone, please. It's my unfortunate responsibility to share with you some terrible news. It seems that over the weekend, your fellow student, Marina Mills, committed suicide. How'd it go? Fine. I just told them she was stalking me and kind of went crazy. Hey, don't beat yourself up about it. - That girl was completely nuts. - She needed help, though. Yeah, like, serious help. Not from a sophomore in Psych 201. Look on the bright side. Might be able to get out of class for the funeral. God. No, no, no. There's not gonna be a funeral, there's no body. What do you mean? Cops were at my dorm this morning and... They don't know where she did it, but it wasn't there. I heard she hasn't swiped her key card since last weekend. And that's not what freaks me out. What freaks me out, is that they don't know who this girl even was. Her, uh, contact info, her social security, it's all been deleted from the school database. They don't even think that Marina Mills was her real name. - Are you serious? - You all right? That's weird. You're killing my cheeseburger vibe. - Oh, my God. - What's going on? Why are you watching this? - Who sent you this crap? - She did. - She's dead. - I know. Again, you'll have minutes. This is an actual case study, a very challenging one. Oh, my God. God. Is that the video? I thought you said it was in your messages. You posted it? No, no. Someone did. I didn't. And they tagged all my friends. Laptops away, Miss Woodson. Why would they think I did that? I would, I would never do that. - Did you try changing your password? - Yes, yes. I tried everything. - She's even back in my friends list. - Unfriend that dead bitch. I can't. So, according to you, Miss Woodson, this video just magically appeared on your timeline this morning? - Do I have that right? - Why would I do this? There must be some reason this girl burned that picture of you. Look, Laura, we know that you're a great student, but multiple students reported you harassing Marina. No. She was the one harassing me. She was obsessed with me. Laura, no one's saying it's your fault that Marina took her life. We're looking into everything. But in the meantime, Laura, if you can't delete that video, you're gonna have to delete your profile. Hey, one more thing. Any idea where this girl might have torched herself? No. No, you're not listening to me. I can't delete this video. I can't even delete my account. Like I said, this isn't a call centre. OK, well, what about the dead girl I can't unfriend? Can you do something about that? - Ma'am, I'm not seeing this profile. - What? I just saw it. Is there anyone else I can speak to? I'm afraid they'll just tell you the same thing. What's next? Kobe, I know you're in there. I can hear your stupid game. That was a nice video you posted. Yeah, that's what I'm here about. Wow. You're her only friend. - How special is that? - Shut up. Christ, someone's still uploading things. That... That's intense. I fucking love it. All right. OK, let's take a little peek behind the curtain. What? You have no idea how crazy that is, do you? OK. Look at that. Oh, that... That is what code normally looks like. Not this. I can't even copy this. This isn't, this isn't code. Well, what is it? I don't know. Wait, wait. Can you go back? Just stop looking at that girl's profile. Just stop thinking about her. She killed herself. End of story. She burned and hung herself in front of her laptop. Who does that? Is this gonna be a thing now, you and Kobe hanging out in his dorm room? Is that really what you're thinking about right now? Yeah. I'm thinking about us. What's wrong with that? He's just a friend. You know that. Does he? It's called cyber stalking for a reason. They can't bother you if you're not online. Uh, yeah. Get me some of those, uh, chocolate macadamia crisp thingies. No, they're not, uh... Chocolate potato chips. They're like cookies. Like, uh, crackers, kind of. Just ask the guy there. I go there all the time. The white chubby kid who loves chocolate. Babe, you're not chubby. But you're very fussy. My God. I'm not being fussy. I'm on my period and chocolate makes me feel better. Isabel? Hello? Shit. Jenn? Hello? Kobe? Hey, guys, this isn't funny. Seriously. Guys? Koobes, come on, man. What the hell? What... What the f... No. No, no, no. No. Ugh. No! No! OK, so she's barely talking right now. They're gonna keep her overnight, maybe longer. You can see her if you want. Listen... I didn't know Gustavo that well. Was he on something? No. I saw the medical report. It is insane. Please, just leave. Sweetheart. This is all her fault. She's not herself, Laura. No. Gus wasn't himself. He was having nightmares. So am I. You're scaring us, Izz. What are you talking about? Laura knows. She knows. It doesn't feel real. Promise me you won't look at that girl's profile today. You're driving yourself crazy. Delete your account. Seriously. You want Isabel to see that? - Liv, you know I can't. - I don't care how. Just do it. Fuck. Fuck. Even if it's not you behind these posts, I'm getting a lot of pressure from the students. As long as the posts are up, I have no choice but to suspend you for the rest of the semester. Mom, you don't always have to call me on FaceTime, you know. - Why didn't you call me? - I'm sorry. I... I didn't want you to worry, OK? I'm coming to pick you up. I want you home. No, look... Look, I'll call you later. I promise, OK? Look at that. What the hell? Yeah. She friended him right before he died. And there's something else. - Jesus, Kobe... - I don't want you to watch it. I want you to listen. What is that? I don't know, I think it's wasps. She's got black wasps all over her profile. I did some research, and, um, some people associated them with evil. They say they appeared wherever witches lived. That they'd, like, follow them around and protect them. Jesus. Who was this girl? Do you think you could get us into her room? Come on. Not much into fashion, was she? Do you even know what you're looking for? Well, just anything. Oh, hey, hey. Look, look, look. - That's her. - Yeah, and who are these two? Can you find what school this is? If it's ever been online, yeah. Are you the young lady who called? Marina's friend? Yes. How close did you say you were again? I was just getting to know her when she... I didn't even know her real name. Nedifar. Marina Nedifar. Do you know what happened to her parents? I wouldn't know anything about that. She came to us as a ward of the state. Poor girl. She had such a rough go of things here. She was always very sensitive, always alone, fleeing into her little fantasy worlds. And she found some dark corners online, things no child should see. Sometimes she would just stare at the computer for hours. Nothing on the screen at all. Just her own reflection in the darkness. The kids became terrified of her. They said she gave them nightmares. Get off me! Don't touch me! Get off me! Get off me! Fuck! Jesus! The two boys in the photo, they were found dead near Saddle Mills with their faces mutilated. - They were swarmed by black wasps. - What? Tyler, I know you could get in trouble for this, but, please, can you... Can you access her records somehow, like a family contact or a last address? Something? - We don't even know her last name. - Nedifar. Marina Nedifar. Laura? Hello? Hello? Is anybody here? Hello! This is not real. This is not real. Oh, God. Oh, God. This is not real. This is not real! No! Miss Woodson? Hello? She rips out her own hair before she slits her throat. Now, I've been on this job years, and that's a first for me. There some shitty new drug we don't know about? They never took anything. What I want to know is, where you got the elevator footage that you posted. For the last time, I'm not posting any of this. Well, the good news for you is we can't link your IP address to any of these videos. We couldn't find any address at all, which doesn't make any sense, unless you're familiar with our IT department. It all has to do with this girl. You really know a lot of dead people, Miss Woodson. This is not real! I don't think this was a suicide, Laura. I think it was a ritual. Erm, that, what you're looking at here, these are, these are black mirrors. They've been used in the occult for thousands of years. And they say that if you, if you stare into it, you can communicate with some other side. It's called scrying. But sometimes these witches, if they were being hunted, if they didn't have any other... Any other way out, they would hang and burn themselves in front of a black mirror and become something else. You call it whatever you want, an evil spirit... Erm, a, a demon. Point is, it's how they got revenge on people. Possessing them and, and haunting them and killing them. How'd they ever stop it? It says they had to find the original mirror, the one they burnt themself in front of, and destroy it. You mean... Her laptop. It was her black mirror. We need to find out where she killed herself. What? I mean, there... There has to be something here. You know, something that can help us. I think I'm going home. I can't handle this. I'm so sorry for everything. Please don't go. I'm sorry. I can't. - Way to pay your respects! - Seriously. You're disgusting. You're late. Why is everyone talking about you? What have you done to this girl? I haven't done anything to her! She just... Attached herself to me. Now everyone thinks that... Please, I want you home, baby. You're coming home with me. Well, I can't, I can't. I have to stay and figure it out. Figure what out? ...others suffered serious injuries. Police have a suspect in custody, but are not releasing any information until they complete their investigation. Moore's Grove. It's a deserted farm town about two hours away. There was a fire there years ago. It's some weird commune. Marina's mother, Ada Nedifar, lived there, until somebody burned the whole place down. What? They kept some... Husk of her body alive until Marina was delivered. She was alone in the womb for months. Jesus. She was always alone. Do you think this is where she went to kill herself? I mean, it's the only lead we have. What's going on with her profile? What's that on there? Hey, it's Olivia. Leave me a thing. Something's wrong. Something's wrong. Stop right here. Stop right here and let me out. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Olivia! Olivia! Olivia! Get out, get out. Help her! - Help her! - Help me. She's stable. That's what matters. Thank you so much, Doctor. I appreciate it. She's stable. She might actually make it through this. Even if she does... Marina's never gonna stop. Shit. Just... Just stay here. Stay with Liv. Please. Don't let her be alone. Where are you going? Whoa. Someone had a rough day. What happens if there are still people living there? I mean, what is this place now? I don't know. No matter what, I'm finding that laptop, I'm gonna fucking smash it. - Kobe... - Yeah? - Thanks for coming with me. - Who says I'm doing it for you? Where the hell are you? The cops are asking me a million questions. I'm... I'm going to Moore's Grove, I'm sorry. Don't go there alone. I... I'm not alone. I'm... I'm with Kobe. I'm coming to meet you. So, where is she? I don't know, man. Bad reception. - Yeah. - All right. Keep trying. Shit. - Charming. - Yeah. Thanks. Shit. There's no service. What are you so fucking nervous about? You're gonna be fine. What are you talking about? You said she wants to make you lonely. If that's true, then you are the only one that's safe. Oh, hey, sweetheart. I said no. No Chinese food. Mmm-mmm, no. No, no, no. I said no Chinese. No Chinese. I said n... Sure, yeah. No, I mean, we... We could have Chinese. I... From down... No, down... The one by the... Yeah, I'll call you back. Please, please, please. No, I don't want to die. Please. Oh, my God. Really? Oh, my God. Laura? - Kobe? - What? She's not here. Did you check the basement? What basement? Kobe? Kobe? Kobe? Kobe. What's wrong? I'm sorry. She can't make you lonely if you're dead. Laura! Laura? Hey, it's Laura. Leave a message. What do you mean, you don't know where she is? What happened back there? Hey, dum-dum, I'm fucking talking to you! What happened? Listen to me. If you touched her, I'll fucking kill you. Now where the hell is she? She's absolutely fine! We are completely fucked. She's just peachy. Tyler. Laura, thank God. I thought something happened to you. I... I just texted you an address. Laura... - The factory at Saddle Mills. - I can't hear you. You're breaking up. Tyler? Are you sure you don't want me to take you to a hospital? Take me to the factory. Still think we can beat this, don't you? Shut up, man. Seriously. You got no idea what we're dealing with. I do. I saw where we're headed. - Shut up, man! - I fucking saw it! - Shut up! - You tell me you're going to die for her! Cos we've all been dying for her! Stay in the car, man. Mom? Laura, where have you been? I can't reach you. Mom, are you OK? I'm seeing things, Laura. I keep seeing that girl. I'm sorry. It's my fault. What's happening to us? Listen to me. I'm not going to let anything happen to you. I'm going to sort this out somehow. I'm going to stop this somehow. Mom? - Mom? Mom! - I want to protect you. Mom! Mom! Mom! Laura? Laura! Tyler. Tyler. I was so worried about you. Laura? Hey. Laura. Look at me. My mom, she's... Jesus. What happened to you? Hi. What do you want from me? What else do you want from me? I just want to be friends, Laura. Best friends. Forever. Laura. Laura. Come to me. Come to me. Come to me."
57,2009,Adventureland,American,"In 1987, James Brennan plans to have a summer vacation in Europe after graduating with a comparative literature degree from Oberlin College and to attend a journalism graduate school at Columbia University when his holidays end. A few days after his graduation, his parents advise him to seek a part-time job rather than going to Europe when they unexpectedly announce that financial problems have taken a toll on them and they would be unable to financially support him.
James gets a job at Adventureland, a local amusement park in his hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where his childhood friend Tommy Frigo works. Assistant manager Bobby assigns James to the games area. He meets his co-workers: sarcastic Joel; Bobby's wife and park manager Paulette; Sue O'Malley; Mark; the alluring Lisa P.; and the park's technician, Mike Connell, a part-time musician. Another games worker, Emily ""Em"" Lewin, saves James from being stabbed by a lying, cheating customer.
With her father and stepmother away, Em throws a party and gets to know James. During the conversation, Em persuades James to join her in the house's swimming pool. After Em leaves the pool, James follows only to jump back into the water in humiliation when Frigo announces to the partygoers that he saw James having an erection while leaving the pool. After the party, Connell, who has been having an affair with Em, comes over to further pursue it.
Later that week, James gives Em his mixtape of ""J's Favorite Bummer Songs"" and asks her out for a drink. At the Stardust Lounge she is surprised to learn James has never had sex. They listen to his mixtape and share a first kiss on the way home. The following day, James tells Connell about his strong feelings for Em, which Connell reports to her. Em tells James she wants to take things slow due to problems in her life, leaving James confused and upset. Sue drunkenly makes out with Joel, but rejects him the next day, saying her Catholic parents would not allow her to date a Jew. Outraged, Em calls Sue an anti-Semite in front of other staff members in defense of Joel. Lisa P. asks James on a date, but he has mixed feelings because of his relationship with Em. After Connell talks him into going, he accepts Lisa P.'s offer.
After the date, during which Lisa and James kiss, James learns Em had called to say she regrets having rejected his feelings. Joel later sees James and Em walking together and, irritated by the chain of events, quits. James unsuccessfully tries to talk him out of it, and Joel reveals he's angry at James for dating Lisa P. when James is already in love with Em. James tells Em about going out with Lisa P. After hearing of this, Em goes to Connell's mother's home to end their affair. The park's mentally challenged parking attendant, prompted by Tommy, tells James he saw Em and Connell doing ""pushups without any pants on"" in the back of Connell's car.
James goes to Connell's mother's house, which is where Lisa P. told him Connell takes girls to have sex and sees Em leaving. Shocked to see James, Em becomes tongue-tied. James leaves angrily, and Em cries. James tells Lisa P. about the affair and asks her not to tell anyone, but she tells her friend Kelly. Upon noticing that all the park employees know, Em quits and moves back to New York. A heartbroken James drunkenly crashes his father's car into a tree and passes out. The next morning, his mother angrily wakes him up and tells him he has to pay to repair it with his summer earnings. On top of that, James' friend from Oberlin, Eric who he had initially planned on moving to New York with, calls to let him know that he will not be going to Columbia and instead will be attending Harvard Business School, thus canceling their living arrangements.
Now, without enough money for graduate school or a place to live, James nonetheless heads to New York City with his parents' blessing and waits outside Em's apartment in the rain. She is reluctant to talk to him, feeling she has ruined everything. James tells her he sees her in a different way than she sees herself. Touched, Em brings James up to her apartment. James reveals he would rather attend Columbia University next year. He gets out of his wet clothes and Em offers him an Adventureland T-shirt to change into. They kiss and begin to take their clothes off. James asks, ""Are we doing this?"", and Em says, ""I think so.""",6.8,tt1091722,"God, what a mess on the ladder of success Where you take one step and miss the whole first rung Dreams unfulfilled graduate unskilled It beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten We are the sons of no one Bastards of young We are the sons of no one Bastards of young The daughters and the sons Look, I'm going to be paying off these student loans until, like, 2003. Hey, you want to get out of here? - What a rager, huh? - Yeah. Yeah. Isn't it weird that all this, this all happened at the end of the semester? You and me. James... I don't think I can see you anymore. You don't... What do you mean? Sorry. Women are mercurial, man. - And you did just start dating last week. - It was days ago. You didn't tell her about the Scarlet V, did you? - That has nothing to do with it. - Oh, Christ. Brennan. - What? - You did! You promised me! Look, I don't lie to people who I care about. Yes, but you could've just left it out of the narrative. You know? You don't want ""virgin"" to be your signifier. He takes one semiotics class, and I'm supposed to... Here, drink up. You need to bed down the next lonely, plain- looking, insecure depressive who throws herself at you and get it over with. Look, I know most people have low standards. I guess I'm... I'm different. Well, you know what, we'll find you a girl, all right? - When we're on the Continent. - Here's to sexually- permissive cultures! Yes! Focus on Europe. It's going to be a transformative experience. To the graduate. Yeah, so I researched some more youth hostels, and the median cost is just a little higher than I expected, about 7.68 more, multiplied by the days is 322.56. Bill, do you want to take this? Excuse me, can you get me a refill here? That's an old- fashioned. So with the 368 I have from Grandpa's trust fund, plus the 900 you guys are already giving me, thank you, I do need an additional 279.11. James, we didn't want to spoil your graduation, but your father has been transferred to a different department. Really? Is that... Is that bad? Yes, we're making less, considerably less. Because this trip was my graduation present, so... Sweetie, I am so sorry about this trip, but I'm afraid we just can't afford it. You could still help me with rent next year, right? All right, James, you're not listening to me. - Here you go, sir. - There we go. Thank you very much. Listen, here's to you, kiddo. Happy graduation. Wait. What am I going to do about grad school? You know, Columbia's holding a spot for me. Well, if you end up deciding that's what you want to do, then obviously you're going to have to get a job. A summer job? Summer in Pittsburgh. - That's fucking harsh. - It's a nightmare. They don't like people like me where I'm from. You know, we're romantics. I read poetry for pleasure, sometimes. Hey, yeah, well, you know what, don't worry about it, all right? You know, with my dad's connections, we'll get a great deal on an apartment. And, hey, I'll float you for the first few months. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Thank you so much, Eric. - Hey, don't worry about it. What the hell are you doing? Our parents are right over... What, them? They're clueless. Fuck, this is good weed. Speaking of which, I just want you to know that you'll be with me in spirit this summer. - Hey, put that away. - Yeah. Take it. - No. - Take it. - Take it! - Okay. Look, James, I know things suck right now, all right? But look at it this way, in a few short months, you'll be with me, in New York City, the greatest fucking city in the world! Like we always talked about, man. Living the adventure together. Quit worrying, Brennan. That's what the weed is for. Bill, for God's sakes, pay attention. All right, I'm just trying to drive. Here she ever comes now now She ever comes now now She ever comes now Here she ever comes now now She ever comes now now She ever comes now Oh, it looks so good She's made out of wood Just look and see Here she ever comes now now She ever comes now now She ever comes now Here she ever comes now now She ever comes now now She ever comes now Oh, it looks so good She's made out of wood Just look and see I really haven't had that many jobs, per se, but here are my academic records and my extracurricular activities. I wrote for The Gordian Knot, it was a literary journal in college. And in math, I got on the SATs, so I assume I'd be good at tabulating checks. These are the only jobs you've ever had? No, no, I also spent several years taking care of a neighbor's lawn, the Palmieris. I have their letter of recommendation here. All right. Fill this out. I'll call you if anything comes up. Okay. No, I've never actually driven an asphalt mixer, per se, but I did once drive my friend's van to Wisconsin on a pretty lengthy road trip. Yeah, so... Okay, is there any way I can take a lesson... They hung up. What am I supposed to do? I'm not even qualified for manual labor. The only place I know I can get a job is with Frigo. What, at Adventureland? You got a concussion on the teacup ride there when you were 6. - You can do better, kiddo. - No, there's nothing. I majored in Comparative Literature and Renaissance Studies. Unless someone needs help restoring a fresco, I'm screwed. Oh, for God's sake, Bill. - Nad attack! - Frigo, Frigo! Hey, get off of me. - Brennan, come here. - Frigo, stop. Okay. There's the lawn mower, lawn mower, lawn mower! - Yes! - Frigo. Oh, Brennan! Right here, sir! Right here, sir! Have a funtastic time! I don't have much work experience, per se, but... I'm sorry. Paulette? Come in, Paulette? Bobby? Bobby? - Paulette, come in, Paulette? - Channels. - You just... You gotta press it. - Oh, they're gone. Okay. This is James, and he's applying for a games job. Games! Oh, great, good. Let's get you set up. Actually, Bobby, I'd prefer a rides job, if it's still open. You look more like a games guy, plus I've already got out the games application, so... All right? Okay. Yeah, no. I just... My name is Bobby. Okay, rules. No freebies, no free turns for your friends, - no free upgrades, no free food. - So, just nothing is free here. Everybody has to pay for everything. And more importantly, working in games, no one ever wins a giant- ass panda. Yeah, we don't have that many left. Cool? Can you hand me a T- shirt, please? Here, I have a resume. I don't know if you still want to take a look at it. James? Am I pronouncing that right? - James? James? - Yeah. Okay, by accepting this T- shirt, you are... Hired! Well, usually I... - More of a ceremonial thing, the T- shirt. - Sorry. Okay, new guy, let's get this over with. Here we are at the first of many shitty games. This one is inexplicably called The Flighing Dutchman. Even more inexplicable is how they decided to spell it. Hey, Jerry. 1 buys rings. If one of the rings lands on one of the red bottles, they win a giant- ass panda. - That is a giant- ass panda. - Yeah, it's the best prize in the park. And that's because this game is un- winnable. Observe. I'll drop a ring from inches away. So nobody ever wins? If someone wins a giant- ass panda on your watch, you should just go home because you're fired, okay? So the object of the game is to knock the hat off the dummy with a softball, except, as you'll see, half the hats are glued on. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, we pay little Malaysian kids cents a day to make these toys, we can't just give them away. You get a 5- minute bathroom break every hours. I recommend saving a few of those up in case you have to go number 2. Brennan, they got you working on games? What a pussy! You're such a pussy! - You know that demented person? - Yeah. He used to be my best friend. Then I turned 4. So if you stand directly below the hoop, you will see that it's been hammered into an oval shape. But from back there, the sucker just can't tell. Jesus, that's so wrong. A criminal abuse of the laws of perspective. Yeah, well, people are getting ripped off. Yeah, yeah, Trotsky, let's get you a booth. So your life must be utter shit, or you wouldn't be here. I was supposed to go to Europe, but my family has money problems. Wait till your parents start making you pay rent. My dad even makes me pay utilities. I don't want... I catch the paper boy But things don't really change I'm standing in the wind But I never wave bye- bye But I try I try Hey, litterbug! In the clown mouth! Okay, we have a winner. It's the purple horse. Green's in 2nd. Yellow's 3rd. Congratulations. Here you go. You can have that. - Hey, James? - Yeah? You think you can maybe, you know, take it up a notch? Yeah, I know. Maybe I'm not the right guy to run this game. I really... I think I should probably be on the rides department. No. No, no, no. You're more of a game guy. - No, you're very... You're very gamey. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Have you ever seen a horse race before? Have you ever, like, heard one on the radio? Harness racing or, like, the normal kind? - That's a good question. - It doesn't really matter. Look, the Kentucky Derby. Have you seen the Kentucky Derby? The way they announce it on the radio, and it's really... Yeah, yeah, yeah. ""100, 200, 200, going..."" - That's an auction, sweetie. - Right. So don't... Yeah, just get into it, you know? Make it a show. Make it a performance. You know what I mean? That's what people come for. So, let's take it to a 10. All right, got faith in you, man. Thank you. - Take it to a 10. I like that. - Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, put down your mint juleps. Horses are all at the starting gate. Okay, and they're off! And Red bolts out of the gate, taking an early lead! But look out! Here comes Green, issuing a challenge from the outside lane. Green runs well on a muddy track, folks, so today's conditions give him a slight edge. And Yellow is dead last! What a disappointment after Yellow's strong showing at Saratoga last spring. Wait! Look out! Wait a second! Out of nowhere, Orange breaks ahead of the pack, and now, in the backstretch, Orange and Green. Orange and Green, and Orange takes it by a nose! Green places and Red shows. Please come to the window to collect your winnings! - What window? There's a window? - No. No, there's not. Here you go. Congratulations, sir. I'm new. Our original initiative rapidly got all tangled up in the sale of arms. And the sale of arms got tangled up... Hey, why don't you call one of your old friends? I heard Danny's back in town. Or Pat? And tell them I work as a carny? No, thank you. - Yo! Guy! - Yeah? - Give me five. - Okay. Hey, I heard some big fat lady fell off the Paratrooper. Oh, really? I didn't hear about that. Was she okay? I don't know. Hey, you know what? Give me 10. - Okay. - You know what? Make it 15. Yeah, I heard she was this big, fat, slob of a woman, you know? Hey, he won! Check it out! Way to go, Dom! Way to go, Dom! - We got a winner! - Come on, check it out! Okay, sir, actually, I saw you holding him over the bottles. That's cheating. Oh, no. He won fair- and- square, sir. You know, you gotta give him a prize! - Yeah, I saw him throw it! - Hey, thank you, sir. - Guys, hey, fellas, I could lose my job. - This faggot's trying to rip off a kid! Why don't you give the kid a fucking panda. Here you go, here's your panda. Yeah, thanks. Here you go, Dom. I mean, he's just a little kid. Look, am I gonna get in trouble? No one's ever supposed to lose a giant- ass panda. Is it worth getting knifed over? No. - Hi. I'm James Brennan. I just started. - Em. Nice to meet you. Sucks you're gonna lose your job your second day, James. No. Shit. I need this job. I'm kidding. You're okay. I'll tell Bobby you lost the panda at knifepoint. Yo, Connell! Rock on! - Who's that? - Connell. He's the maintenance guy. Hey, Joel, is that a pipe? Yeah, I know. It's a revolting affectation, but it relaxes me. - Hey, Joel. Hey. - Hi. You guys want some of this? - I bagged it from Paulette. Cuban rum? - Thanks. I think somebody was trying to write ""Satan Lives"" on that wall, but they spelled it ""Satin Lives."" One of those textile- worshipping cults, no doubt. - That's quite funny. - Yeah. Lou Reed? I like the tee, Em. You know about Connell and Lou, right? No, I don't know about them. Time out, guys. - Guys, he doesn't know the legend. - Oh, my God! - Tell him. - Connell once jammed with Lou Reed. - Really? - The historic Lou Reed. - The Lou Reed. - So Connell's like a real musician? Yeah, he's got his own band. It's frigging awesome. - He's gotta get a lot of pussy with it. - He's married, you perv! Nice pipe, Grandpa! Oh, my God. That was a whole corn dog! I'm sorry, Joel. My brother is such a douche. Looks like it's us! Let's go, panty stain! ""Panty stain,"" that's me. Good night, everybody. Hey, I could give you a ride, if you want. Really? Frigo, I got a ride. Really? - What? - Yeah. - Thank you so much. I got a ride. - Hey, what? You can go. Good night. - You got a ride? - Yes. All right, then. Then why don't you ride this? - Oh, my God. - Frigo. - All right, I'll see you, Brennan. - What the hell was that? It's just my life. I'm curious to know exactly how you are I keep my distance But that distance is too far It reassures me just to know that you're okay But I don't want you to go on needing me this way And I don't want to know if you are lonely - Here, have some rum. - Thanks. Oh, shit. Sorry, my mother. She's very nosy. Yeah, she used to read my journals. I had to start writing them in Italian. I took Italian for a year. I went through an opera... Okay, she's gone. So, Joel told me that you're gonna go to Columbia for grad school. - Yeah. - Wow. I'm at NYU right now. Oh, really? Oh, that's cool. Maybe I'll run into you on the streets of NYC. - What are you studying? - Journalism. Yeah, I want to be, like, a travel essayist. But I want to report on the real state of the world. You know, like Charles Dickens, for example, wrote what you might call travel books, but he visited prisons and mental asylums. - That's cool. - Yeah, is it? - Yeah. - Okay. No, it is, it's... But why do you have to go to grad school for that? No, that's a valid question, but, actually, journalism is kind of like this old boys' network still. You need the right connections. It's very Ivy League, very exclusive. Stupid. I think my mother would rather I intern at some Fortune company or something like that. - Fuck that, right? - Yeah. Yeah. I got to go. I have to meet a friend. - Okay. Yeah, thanks for the ride. - Sure. Hey, I heard you jammed with Lou Reed. - Don't believe everything you hear. - Okay. I'll tell you about it sometime. So, where does your band play? Usual shitholes around town. I need better musicians. - I'm starting a new band out in LA. - Los Angeles? Yeah. It's going to be cool. Going this winter. - Jesus. - Nasty. You'll get better at avoiding that. Hey, guys. Party at my house tonight. My dad's out of town. I'm invited? Yep, that's why I'm telling you. - Connell? - You kiddies have fun. She's cool, right? You're just smearing that around. Hey, Sue, I'm a virgin at table games, so go easy on me. We're having a ping- pong tournament! - Hey. - Hey. Nice digs. Kind of begs the question of why the hell you're working at Adventureland? Well, you know, my dad's a lawyer. It's been his life- long dream for his daughter to work at Adventureland. - High hopes. - Also gets me out of the house. So we can drink your parents' booze. It's okay? - Absolutely. - Yes! - Awesome. - Don't touch me. Hey, I actually brought something for the party. - What is that? - It's a joint. - Oh. - Yeah. Bobby is weird. I had to go back and get the extra employee key for the bathroom, and I went back, I opened the door, and there were all these pictures of him and Paulette, naked. What a weirdo. Hey, I'm gonna go for a swim. Anybody care to join me? Okay. Come on. Is anybody else coming in here, or is it just us? Yeah, okay. - See, it's not so bad. It's okay. - No, it's okay. - Do you have any more of that pot? - Yeah, at home. Why? - We should make pot cookies. - Okay. That would be so fun. Have you done that? - I have not. I've had cookies. - All right. My connections have all dried up. That's why I'm asking. Your connections have dried up? What, you think, I have ties to the underworld or something? I have joints. You think I can, like, put a hit out on somebody? - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh, my God! I got you. I got the door. It's only feet, so I can handle it. Okay. - I'm gonna get a drink. - Okay. You want one? - Coming? - Yeah. Yeah, I'll meet you inside. - Okay. - I'll meet you inside. - Okay. - Okay. Shit. Boner! You got a boner! Brennan's got a boner! Yeah! Thanks. I like your records. Eno, Replacements, Big Star. Hey, give me your underwear. I'll throw them in the dryer for you. - I promise you'll get them back. - Yeah. Thank you. - Who's that? - It's my stepmom. I don't think there's any pictures of my mom in here. - She died years ago. - Really? I'm sorry. My dad remarried last year. That's Francy. You see that unholy abomination on her head? - Yeah. - It's a wig. Is it? She had, like, a nervous breakdown when her first husband divorced her. Lost all her hair. I would feel bad if she wasn't such a status- obsessed witch. - I'm buzzed. You? - Yeah, kind of. - What was that? - What was what? I'm gonna go... You want to go see what they're doing? Yes. I think I drank, like, a whole bottle of vodka. You were drinking vermouth the whole night, it's disgusting. Yeah, it's a type of vodka. You okay? Frigo? What are you doing? Okay, good night! Hello? Hey. No, actually, the party broke up pretty early. I'm in here. Crack of dawn Cindy's movin' on She's talking Cindy to everyone - So we have, like, minutes? - No. Though I've heard it before There's not much point in wasting time, though. But I just can't get away Cindy kills me every day Lisa P. is back! - Lisa P. is back! - Lisa P.? Did you hear that? Lisa P. is back! Lisa P. is back! - Brennan, Brennan, Lisa P. is back! - Yeah? Who's Lisa P.? Holy mother of crap! ""Who's Lisa P.?"" That's Lisa P. Come on, come on Have you ever heard those opening lines You should leave this small town way behind I'll be your partner Show you the steps Oh, my God, look at the shape of her ass. It's a platonic ideal. That ass is a higher truth. Look, look at that little portal of light, just below her crotch, right where the thigh meets the pudendum. The pudendum? Are you pre- med? I'm telling you, man, I've had dreams about that diamond- shape portal. She's coming over here, man. Be cool. Okay, I'll try to hold it together. - Hey, Lisa. Hey, Kelly. - Hey, Joel. So, I didn't expect you to be back here. Oh, man, I had my whole summer, like, mapped out. Laying out by the pool by day, dancing by night. But my dad got injured on the job, and he's laid up, so I got to help out. Sorry to hear that. My mom has shingles. Oh. Well, I gotta go run the Musik- Express. I don't want Paulette bitching me out on my first day. - I'm Lisa. - James. I heard you lost a giant- ass panda at knifepoint. Did you? I guess my legend precedes me. - What? - It was nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too, James. Bye, Lisa. Bye, Kelly. A little more than 40 of these fish are dead. I am amazed at how tiny my paycheck is, after working doubles. Well, we are doing the work of pathetic, lazy morons. Jesus fucking Christ, they play this song, like, times a day. Fucking sadists. Fucking sadists! Hey. - Hey. - Hey, I made you a tape. These are my favorite bummer songs. They're truly miserable, pit- of- despair type songs. - I think you'll love it. - Cool. Yeah. Hey, you want to get a drink or something? Sure. I got a fever of 103 Come on, baby Do you do more than dance? I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded - Hey, I feel like I should tell you. - Tell me what? Yeah. I had my heart broken recently. Is that... I don't know, I just thought I should tell you. - That sucks. - Yeah. - Who broke your heart? - A girl at school. Yeah, it's typical. I actually... I think there was... I think there was something there. I think that we actually had, like, potential. I don't know. I think she was afraid. Afraid of what? I don't know. Afraid of it being good or something. Was the sex good? She was very sexy. You've been with a lot of girls? Yep. Are we talking about, like, intercourse specifically? Yeah. No, in that case, there were actually a few times that I... Yeah, a few times I could've done that. But it wasn't... It wasn't exactly right. Wait, so you're telling me you're a virgin? - There were circumstances... - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God. - No, I went... Okay, all right, for example, junior year, I was dating this girl, Betsy Cooke. Betsy was kind of, like... She was kind of a prude, actually. Anyway, one day, I was reading Shakespeare, and I realized I don't really love this person. You know? It was one of the sonnets. ""Being your slave, what should I do ""but tend upon the hours and times of your desires?"" And I realized I don't want to tend to Betsy's hours or her times. All right, that doesn't matter. Anyway, I drove to Betsy's house, and I was literally about to tell her, and that's the night she said she wanted to have sex. Can you believe it? It was the same... You know, it was the same night, so... And you didn't just fuck her anyway? No. So what about you and intercourse? - Can you stop saying ""intercourse""? - Sure, sure. I don't know. There were guys in high school, and then, like, there were other ones. - Were you in love with any of them? - No. Hell no. Got you. Oh, hey, it's Connell. Hey, Connell! - Jimbo. - Hey, you know this place? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everybody knows this is my joint. These guys work at the park. This is Ronnie. Nice to meet you. - Hi. - Hey. We're gonna go meet some friends in the back. Cool. Do it! My nephew! Is that Connell's wife? She's, like, really pretty. Yeah, she is. She works at that lame disco, Razzmatazz. - It's kind of sad. - Oh, yeah? I've never been there. No, I mean their marriage is sad. He didn't want it. Now he's trapped. Are you sure you want to go? The band is really awful. - Yeah, I just needed some air. - Okay. Sometimes I feel so happy Sometimes I feel so sad Sometimes I feel so happy But mostly you just make me mad Baby, you just make me mad Linger on Your pale blue eyes Linger on - Hey, can we go somewhere? - Yeah. Thought of you as my mountain top Thought of you as my peak Thought of you as everything I've had but couldn't keep Hey. Linger on Your pale blue eyes - You made out with her? - Yeah. Yeah, I just kissed her. I don't know what came over me. It was incredible. Cool, man. How was that? Fantastic. Joel, she's like... She's, like, perfect, you know? - Good for you, man. - Yeah. I got to open my booth. Hey, do you have an ice- pick I can jam into my ears? I can't listen to this song again. I don't, but I have this. - Be cool with that. - Okay. Thanks. - Were you on a date last night? - I wouldn't call it a date. Not into Em? No, she's great. She's great. I just... I don't know if I'm ready for a girlfriend yet. I'm kind of getting over a broken heart. - I hope you didn't tell her that. - Why? You told her that, didn't you? James, no girl wants to hear about some other chick you're hard up for. - Right. They don't? - They don't. Look, I'm not saying never be vulnerable with a girl. I'm just saying don't play that card first. Wait, it's a card? Like a card? There's a science to it. You're probably pretty good at science. - That works now. - Yeah. Okay. Okay, observe. options. I can play it safe, pick them off from back here, or I can rush into the breach, guns a- blazing. Make a run right at the cortex, and bombs away. Fortune favors the bold. Virgil said that. I'm sure Virgil had Bionic Mutant in mind. I'm gonna go punch out. - All right, bye. - Your turn, man. Okay, but I'm probably not gonna be very good at this. Hey. I really want to see you tonight. - Tonight? - Yeah. Unless you got something else going on. You're doing really good. I jump when he jumps just instinctively. Where? Where do you wanna go? Not the backseat of your car. We can go to my mom's. - Hey, James? - Yeah? Whoa, bonus round. Kudos. I heard you might have some weed. Yeah, I have a stash. Why, you like the ganja? Sometimes. Beer? - Got anything stronger? - Yeah. So what excuse do you give your mother for coming down here so late? Gotta pump some midnight iron? Sometimes I come here to practice. Give Ronnie a break. You still hot for your wife? What's the sex like? Why? Why would you... Why would you say that? - Don't be mean. - Jeez, you're sensitive. No, I'm serious. When we're together, we're good to each other. Let's not ruin it. Okay. So, how's your dad? Since he can't work, he's been so fucked up. Yeah. Stays in bed a lot. Won't see anyone. - Men are prideful creatures. - Exactly. Do you believe in God? Wow, theology doesn't come up a lot around here. Yeah, but you see someone you love in pain, you sort of think about that kind of stuff. I believe in love. I mean, I think that love is very transferable, I mean, transformable. I think that love makes things transform together. I'm majorly high. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Yeah, me, too. I'm having dinner with my parents. Somebody's hungry. James, I read that Pitt has some journalism courses. - Is that so? - Oh, yeah? Yeah, I was just thinking that, you know, it might make fiscal sense for you to stay close to home for a while. And they have these broadcasting internships on Mister Rogers'. I get to intern on a kids' show with marionettes. Mom, I thought you wanted me to go to an Ivy League school, like the one I've been accepted to. I am... I am just trying to be pragmatic. They're hand puppets, not marionettes, on Mister Rogers'. You know, like, ""Royal greetings, I am King Friday."" That's a terrible impression. James, what is wrong with you? We, the people, in order to have a more perfect union, say, ""Let's party!"" Hey! Jugglers, fireworks! Mr. Fabulous' Incredible Performing Canines tonight! Hey, kid. In the clown mouth. Come on. - Be a pal. Thanks, buddy. - Eat it! Son of a bitch! Get him! Get him! - Come here. - Be careful. All right! Hey! Oh, my God! I don't even celebrate July 4th, you know? I celebrate Bastille Day. That's why Bastille Day is gonna be a blast for me. There is freedom within There is freedom without Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup There's a battle ahead Many battles are lost But you'll never see the end of the road While you're traveling with me Hey now, hey now Don't dream it's over Hey now, hey now When the world comes in They come, they come To build a wall between us We know they won't win - Park's closed, Em. - Yeah. - Rich, you scared the hell out of us. - Rich, it's me, James. - Park's closed, James. - Okay, we'll leave soon, okay? Better leave now. The park's closed. - All right, we better leave now. - Okay. Here we go. Okay. Thanks, Rich. Don't dream it's over Hey now, hey now When the world comes in They come, they come I think you're so beautiful. Oh, fuck. - Hey, kids! - Hey, hey. Hey, what's going on? - It's my friend James, Dad. - Hi. Nice to meet you, sir. - Nice to meet you, James. - You, too. - Hi, James. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Well, I'm gonna go do some work before bed. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night, party pooper. So, it was a lovely party at the Melnicks'. And, you know, their daughter Lori is lovely. Now, she said you two used to be best friends. She used to sleep over in, like, junior high. Did you know that she is at law school at Northwestern? Lori Melnick, she once violated our cat Gypsy with a ballpoint pen. All right, Emily! That's enough, young lady. See you later. Sy. I can't believe my dad wants to be with that. Do you want to hear something fucked up? What? When my mom first started getting, like, really sick, my dad starts going to temple. He's never been serious about his faith. But he decided to buddy up to God, like he thought it was going to help save my mom. And that's where he met Francy. My mom loses her hair in chemo, and my dad starts fucking a bald woman. It's just weird. I'll take you home. We started dancing and love put us into a groove As soon as we started to move The music played while our bodies displayed for the dance It's nice when Paulette's got the day off. Put that disco station on. Hey, you know, I'm a one- man woman, so... - Hey, Bobby. I'm on break. - All right, let's see how you did. Hey, babe. How's it... Hello? Yeah, he's right here. It's your mother. Sorry. Hi, Ma. No, Ma, that's the pilot light. It's supposed to be on. No, the place is not going to blow. Ma? I'll be right there. I gotta go. - Jimbo, can I ask you something? - Yeah. You got one of those little baby joints on you? - I do. - Let's go. - Is your mom okay? - Yeah, she's a little dramatic, my mom. Kind of nutty since my dad skipped out. Where'd he go? I don't know. He left a long time ago. - This is cool. - Yeah, Lou Reed. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Satellite Of Love. Of course. Right on. You gotta tell me your Lou Reed story. He's like a real hero to me. - Hey, man, how's it going with Em? - I don't know. It's going... She's... I think I'm in love with her. Soon it will be filled With parking cars I watch it for a little while I love to watch things on TV This will just take a second, Jimbo. Don't finish that joint. Satellite of love Satellite of love Satellite of love Hey. I was hanging out with your boyfriend earlier. - He's in love with you. - What? He said, I quote, ""I think I'm in love with her."" Right. Hey, are you going to Razzmatazz tonight? It's 2- for- Tuesday. You get for the price of one. I want action tonight Satisfaction all night I grab my hat and I grab my shoes Tonight I'm gonna hit the streets and cruise You have to do something! You're not doing anything! I can't take it anymore! Maybe she needs to see Dr. Schacter again. You have to do something, okay? Something has to change. You know she works at that park, that trashy park, just to embarrass us! You're coming through Seems just like a dream It's a mystery to me Fills me within When we're together Oh, baby, can't you see I like to feel the passion To the point of no return What are you majoring in? Russian Literature and Slavic Languages. - Oh, wow, that's really interesting. - Yeah. What career track is that? Cabbie, hot- dog vendor, marijuana delivery guy. The world is my oyster. You kids need another round? - Thanks, Ronnie, we're fine. - Actually, we'll take more. I'll have 2. Joel, you can have 1. - What the hell? Are you gonna stop? - 2- for- Tuesday. Em, I love this song! Come on, let's dance! Let's dance. Come on. Come on. - Come on. - Okay. You are an obsession Here, ready? Stay with me. Unopened at your feet There's no balance - You like that? - Yes. Marcy Feingold, ninth grade, taught me that one. - Good one! - Thanks a lot. - Nice moves, Brennan. - Thanks. - Razzmatazz! - Come on, Razzmatazz, we're hungry. - But we love you more! - It knows. More. Oh, my God. You okay? - Razzmatazz. - Come on. All right. - There you go. - You're so strong- ish. I'll take that. I'm so surprised I'm making out with you. Me, too. Em, I think you're incredible. Hey, there's a lot of shit in my life. I'm not ready for this. I need to take things slow. Okay, all right. I'm sorry. Hey. Let me help you with that. I got it. That is ugly. Thanks. - Hey, so how's your dad? - He's hanging in there. - Yeah? Still... Still not working? - No, no. The Musik- Express! - These rides are safe, right? - Supposedly. I wouldn't mess around on any of them. Last summer, there was this drunk idiot goofing around on the Comet Booster, trying to kick his buddy. They found his Reebok in the parking lot, with his foot in it. - Yo, Lisa. We're partners today. - Great. So it's official. My friend Boomer hooked me up with a job at the Mercedes dealership on Route 30. Yeah, I'm getting a car right away. Payments deducted from my check. Yeah, I'm gonna go for a 560, convertible, in gold, leather interior. I'm even gonna get a compact disc player. - It's gonna be insane. - To the max. So, hey, Lis, you wanna go see Judas Priest at Civic Arena? - My friend Fitzy got me floor seats, so... - That's okay. Take Boomer. And go get the hose. There's dried puke down there. You don't like Priest? - I'm busy that night. - I didn't tell you what night. James, you and I should go out some night. I get it, that's a funny one. Face! Douche. - Just let me know when. - Yeah? Pete, dried puke. I'm serious. I wouldn't mind going out with a nice guy for a change. Cool. Yeah. That would be very cool. Oh, come on, man! - Want to push a button? - No, I'm on games only. Okay, yeah, which one? Okay. - Oh, my gosh! - Shit! Shit! Shit! Wow! You fucked this up perfectly! - I know. I work on games, so... - I'm impressed. I know. I shouldn't have even been here. - Shit. - Hey. Connell, I need to ask you something. Hand me the crescent wrench, would you? Yeah. So, Lisa P. just asked me if I wanted to go out with her sometime. - Lisa P.? - Yeah. It's insane. I think she might've just been trying to piss off Pete O'Malley but... Can you imagine any universe where she would get with a guy like me? She asked you out? You're a fucking idiot if you don't go. It's Lisa P. - Hold this, would you? - Yeah. That girl's a virgin. Can you believe that? Oh. In this day and age. You'd think... Well, she's a Catholic girl. They usually won't let you screw them. - But what they will let you do... - Yeah, but what about Em? Are you getting all your needs met by her? We're taking it slow. Right. Right. Okay, here's the thing. Every time you meet a beautiful woman, don't you imagine what she'd look like underneath you, naked? - What? No. No. - Someone like Lisa P. I mean, Jesus Christ, it's like every cell in your body's on fire, right? That's a little hyperbolic, but, yeah, I know, I see where you're going. That's the way we're wired. It's the way we're wired. It sucks, but it's just a fact of nature. It's also tragic. My feelings for Em are vast. James, imagine it. Lisa P. I know. Lisa P. I know. - Hey. - Hey. I brought you this. It's one of my favorite authors. Gogol. Russian. He lost his mind, burned the only copy of his final book, died a week later of self- starvation. Well... - Thank you. - Yeah. Hey, do you maybe want to go see a shitty movie or something sometime? Yeah, I just... You know, I did something kind of stupid. I... I told my brother that we made out. - That's bad? - No, no, no. But he... He told my parents. We're Catholic. Pete told my parents that you're Jewish. But I'm an atheist. I mean, more of a pragmatic nihilist, I guess, - or an existential pagan, if you will... - Yeah, yeah. But my parents are really strict. I'm sorry. - It's still a good book. - Nah, I'm sorry. - Hey, Joel. - Hey. How'd it go with Sue? Not so good. Hey, Em, come on. Don't say anything! Come on, worse things have happened to the Jews. Fuck that! You know, you don't deserve to date Joel! I mean, you're an anti- Semitic asshole! What do you, like, hate gay people, too? Do you support apartheid? You are not my friend. Bam! Child's play. Look, you can't tell anybody, but I'm going out with Lisa P. tonight. - You're what? - Yeah. This morning she asked me if I wanted to hang out sometime. What happened? I thought you were crazy about Em. I am. I am. But, you know, I don't know if she necessarily, like, wants something, you know, kind of serious. And, Joel, we're men. You know, we're, like, wired to meet our needs. I get it, it's a biological imperative. Frigo, you can't tell anybody, but I have a date tonight with Lisa P. What? You know, I should give you a double- sack- whack - for telling a lie like that. - Okay, don't believe me. - Where are you going? - The Velvet Touch. Thanks. How's the wine? - It's good! - Yeah. I just need to tell you something. Yeah, is it cool if we don't tell a lot of people about tonight? 'Cause I think there's someone at the park who may have a little thing for me, and I don't want her to feel bad. - You mean Em? - Yeah. So you like working at the park? Yeah, I think it could be character building. And, you know, I've made a lot of friends. Yeah, you and Connell seem pretty tight. Yeah, I like him. I think he's interesting. I think he's kind of like a, you know, poetic soul. - That guy's got some problems. - What do you mean? Last summer, he was having this thing with this girl from the snack bar. He used to take her to his mother's basement to have sex with her. His mother's basement. How gross is that? But he's married, right? - Didn't stop him from hitting on me. - Wow. - Is that Frigo? - Yeah, it is Frigo. I wonder what he's doing here. I should say hi. I've known him since... Excuse me. - You son of a bitch, that's Lisa P.!. - What the fuck are you doing here? I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry, I thought you were full of shit, but holy shit! There she is! Think you can get me naked pictures of her? Frigo, get the fuck out of here, and you can't tell anybody about this, okay? All right, all right, relax, Brennan. - What's it worth to you? - You're shaking me down? No... Yeah, yeah. I hate you with such great fervor. I... Thanks, Brennan. Sorry about that. What a coincidence. Frigo was out to rent a video, saw us through the window, and... - Wow. - Yeah. And here we are. I wonder how the fondue is tonight. I want to visit every continent, every country, really. Charles Dickens actually wrote these really interesting travel pieces, but he visited prisons... Would you rather have a sailboat or a speedboat? - Gee, I guess... - I think sailboats are, like, way more cooler, you know, like more classic. Though I bet speedboats would be a lot more fun. What were you saying? Just babbling. Oh. I just need to get normal before I go inside. Put on some perfume to cover the smell. I was going to suggest more perfume. - Shoot, my brush. - Yeah. Hold on. - Jesus, what the hell is this? - Is that yours? - No. I guess it's my dad's. - Here, pull over here. Can you smell the pot? You smell amazing. Thanks for tonight. It was fun. Yeah. Yeah, it was. Fondue. - Oh, God. - Tiger. Sorry. - Another time. - Yeah. - Good night. - Good night. - Hey. - Hey. Hey. I missed your call last night. Sorry about that. I was out with some old high- school buddies. - Sounds fun. - Yeah, it was. We got caught up reminiscing. I was out pretty late. But what were you calling about? Calling to say sorry. I felt like I was kind of a jerk the other night. Okay. Sorry. Yeah, me, too. I was drunk. And I brought you something. - This bag? - Mmm- hmm. What's inside the bag? - Is that a couple of joints? - I think so. For pot cookies. - Oh, my. You follow through. - I do. Cool. This'll be fun. - Let's do it. - Okay. I'm only having half, okay? Walnuts? You want to see me go into anaphylactic shock? Fuck. - Home- made? Yummy. - Brennan, you gonna eat the other half? Sorry. Spinning on that dizzy edge I kissed her face and kissed her head And dreamed of all the different ways I had to make her glow ""Why are you so far away?"" she said ""Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you ""That I'm in love with you"" You Soft and only You Lost and lonely You Strange as angels Dancing in the deepest oceans Twisting in the water And what a race we have here today, ladies and gentlemen. Boy! And nobody is in the lead. Nobody is in the lead. In fact, what is so mind- blowing about this particular race is how evenly- matched these particular competitors are. And Yellow is dead last. I don't think Yellow's moved once. This is a fall from grace for the once- great stallion, Yellow. You know, Yellow has inseminated over 1, foals in his lifetime, which might explain his current exhaustion. And you won, Number 9, here you go... Here you go, great job. Hey, Bobby. Brennan, what are you doing? - You been toking up? - What? - You been drinking drugs? - No! Your eyes are red. Have you been crying? Yeah, maybe, like, a little bit before. But no, Bobby, I'm feeling sick because I think I ate a bad corn dog before, Bobby. That's why. You know, why don't you go over to Hats Off T o Larry - and collect some balls? - Okay. And I'll tell you what, I'll take over this. Hey, you all right? - Yeah, thank you. - All right. This is how we met. And they're off! In the lead is Green 5. Green is in the lead. Green 5, Green in the lead. And there you are, Green 5! Green! You really got it going on! You know exactly what you're doing. Green! You got it, Green! You won! Pass that down to her. Loser, pass that down. Thank you. - Can I get some balls? - You're gonna have to get more balls. The customer's always right. Here you go. - I hit that thing dead- on! - Yet he still retains his chapeau. Whoa, whoa. Come on. Hey! What the fuck? It's glued on, the fucking thing. - It's not worth it. - We have a winner. - Nicky. - Congratulations. The fucking thing is glued on? His hat is glued on? - Fuck this, Nicky. - What is so fucking funny? - Yeah, what's so fucking funny? - I don't know. - Oh, my God! - My God. - What the fuck? - Not so funny now, is it? You can't do shit like that. Like, what the fuck? - You punch him in the face? - Back off, slut! - Don't fucking touch her, man. - What are you gonna do, faggot? Oh, fuck. - You're fucking dead! - You jerk! Breaking the law, breaking the law Breaking the law, breaking the law - The option of the flute? - Option of the flute... People are trying to kill me. Get the fuck out, motherfucker! Move. Get out of my doorway, motherfucker! Give me a reason! Just give me a fucking reason! You don't know what I'm capable of! Come on! Please! You don't know what I'm capable of! - Bastard. - Thanks, Bobby. - No problem. - Okay, I'm gonna take the back way. Yeah, yeah, good. You know what, now that I think of it, the flute is actually more expensive. You guys should have seen Brennan wail on that greaseball, man. - I can't believe you hit someone. - Me, either. How'd you do it? Did you hit him like this? Oh, psych! Dude, this guy was huge. I mean, Brennan went up, like, one hit... - And just dropped the guy. - I can't believe they call that a hit. Then his buddy started chasing him all around the park, and then he hid in Bobby's office. Yeah, see, that's more like the son of a bitch. Bobby kicked the door down and came out all psycho with this bat like... And all his buddies just go, ""Okay."" Where's the guy? Was he ever... I don't know. They left him on the pavement. Then I got his girlfriend's number. Where are you taking me? You've never been to this place before? No. I think you might be the coolest and cutest guy I ever met. Really? I mean, I'm really high, but... I don't want to lose you. - Forget to refrigerate these? - Yeah. When did they get in, yesterday? - Around what time? - In the morning. - They smell weird? - Yeah. - I think that's normal, though. - Yeah. Stuffy, fry these up! Hey, Brennan, I want to talk to you. Want to pick up some extra shifts? - Yeah, sure. - Good. Because Joel quit. - What? - He's passed on. He moved on, honey. He didn't pass on, he moved on. I know, I heard you! - What are you doing here? - You didn't call me back. Look, I can't abide the humiliation of you seeing the inside of my house. The vile plastic slipcovers, the art- fair paintings. And it's really messy. Just go around back. I'll meet you. Okay. Hey, Jeffrey! Turn off the fucking lawnmower. - Fine. - I'm trying to have a conversation here. - Fuck off, fuck face. - Nimrod. I hate you, asshole. - Hey, is it because of Sue? - What? Why you quit. Because, Joel, you're a great guy, you know, and she doesn't deserve you. James, look at me. I'm not a good- looking guy. And I'm poor. Girls aren't gonna go near me when there's all these fucking yuppies around. That's ridiculous. Not all women are like that. You know, Em isn't like that. - Em? - Yeah. You don't even appreciate what you have. You're chasing after Lisa P. when you have this incredible, beautiful girl right fucking there. Fuck this. Don't do that. - I thought you were off today. - I need to tell you something. Last week I went on a date with Lisa P. She asked me out. It was nothing. We kissed a little bit at the end of the date, and I felt her breast a little bit, but nothing else. Right. No intercourse? No. No intercourse. Look, I'm sorry, it's just... You and I never talked about being exclusive. I don't want to see her again, okay? You're the one I... Look, we'll both be in New York soon, and I want to hang out with you. I want to get to know you better, if you want to get to know me better as well. James, you don't owe me anything. I know, but I want to owe you things. I'm ready to owe you things, okay? Because I really, really care about you. - Are you mad at me? 'Cause I'm sorry. - No, no. I'm not mad at you. Thanks for telling me. That was, like, really sweet. - Are you crazy? You can't come here. - I just can't do this anymore. I'm starting to really fucking hate myself, you know? Oh, Christ. My wife probably heard me come in. Just... I gotta... We'll find someplace to talk. I gotta go make an excuse. Park outside my mom's house, okay? - Okay. - All right. Brennan. Yo, Brennan. Come here! Brennan, you gotta hear this. Tell him. Tell him what you told me. I ate too many circus peanuts. No, what? No, not that, retard. The other thing, the thing about Em. Frigo, shut up. Wait, what thing about Em? I saw Em and Connell in his car. Right, right. What were they doing in the car, Rich? They were doing push- ups in his car. They didn't have any pants on. No pants. Naked push- ups, retard, for fucking. - James, they were fucking. - Frigo, Frigo. Shut up. - When did you see this, Rich? - Like, a while ago, a while ago. It was just a couple of weeks ago, right, Rich? - Hello? - Mr. Lewin, it's James. Is Emily there? She said she was with you. She said she was gonna go meet you. Oh, yeah. I think we got our wires crossed. Okay, bye. What'd he say? Can you get your mother's car? All right, I got the keys. Push me out. I don't want to drink. Did you know James went out with Lisa P. last week? - I know. - You know. - You want me to rat out James? - Right. - Slow down. - Shit. It's Em's car. Let's wait here. I stole some of my grandma's cough medicine if you want some. - No. - It's grape. - No, please. - Okay. Can you sit down, please, just for a second? - Look, you want to end this? - Yes. I got a hockey stick in the back, if you want to smash the windows. - Frigo, shut the fuck up, okay? - All right, okay, Brennan. - Just trying to help. - Oh, shit. What are you doing here? Are you and Connell, like... It started in, like... I didn't even know you when it... How did you... What are you... How did you find me here? Lisa P. told me that Connell used to take some other girl here last summer to his mother's basement. Right. Yeah, I just, like, don't understand how you could do this. I came here to... I know. I know I fucked up, too, okay? I fucked up one time, and I fucking told you about it, and you... You think I'm, like, some fucking pathetic idiot or something. You're not a fucking idiot. I'm a fucking idiot. Yeah, that's right. Shit. I am the champion. To the victor go the spoils. - Here you go. - What? What is this? - Is it a banana? - It's a banana with eyes. I'd watch my mouth if I were you, carnival boy. Hey. What's up? I mean... I actually feel sorry for them, you know. Like, sneaking around and lying to everybody. It's, like, so pathetic. He's a married man. I know. I know. Hey, Lisa, you can't, like, tell anybody about this. Ever. Of course, I would never. Thanks. Hey, Em, what's up? Loving life, you know. Hey, you know I play the drums? I did this killer drum solo at the high- school talent show once. I played Limelight by Rush. 1, 2, 3, 4! Living on a lighted stage Approaches the unreal For those who think and feel In touch with some reality Beyond the... Spin. Good night, Adventureland! - What the fuck was that? - You like musicians, right? Hey, honey, I'm running out of googly eyes. Do you have any more over there? Yeah, me, too, but I found these, so I've just been sort of... - Hey. - Hey, Em! What's up? I quit. See you. Tommy, you think there's something wrong with this car? Have your father check it because it's making a funny squeaking sound. I don't know what the problem is. Shit- head! Shake a leg and come aboard the SS Adventureland. I'm not friends with anybody. How the hell would I know? - I don't know. - No way! Em? Em Lewin? Yes, yes, yes. Can you believe that? Em has been sleeping with Connell all summer. - I'm telling you, man. - Connell is a freaking god. - Hey, Lisa. - Hey. Hi. Look, I don't know what to say, but everyone is talking about Em and Connell. Kelly's got such a big F- ing mouth. I'm sorry because I gave you my word. We were just so wasted that night. You know I can't hide nothing from Kell. Are you mad at me? Well, yeah. Connell's gonna freak out, and Em quit. I feel bad for Connell. I have a hard time feeling sorry for Em. Guys can't help themselves. - But he's the married one. - Yeah, Em's a frigging home wrecker. - He's cheating on his wife, though. - I can't believe you're defending her. What? Because guys can be shitty and women can't? The Musik- Express! Kell. It's fun because it's really more like dancing than exercising, you know. I have a blast. I've been trying to get him to go with me, but he won't go. No, you're not doing it right. Yeah, I don't like lifting my knees that high. Yeah, I've noticed. Emily, you know the Ostrows and the Waldsteins. Hi there. Can I get anyone a refresher? Francy, these pieces, I love them. So great. Those there? I love those. I think they are so fun. You're so artsy. I love what you've done with the house. - Thank you. - It's... It's clean. I thought the house was a lot nicer the way my mom used to have it. It's pretty barfarific, if you ask me. - Is that some kind of joke, Emily? - No, it's not. I think you owe me an apology. Right now. I don't owe you shit. All right, okay. You know what? Give me the drink. Look, you weren't invited, and I don't want you here, okay? - Right, I wasn't invited to this party. - Yes, you weren't invited, and frankly, I don't like you coming in here and saying whatever the hell you want, okay? I am sick and tired of your behavior, you ungrateful little bitch. - Give me the drink. - Okay, Em... God damn it! Emily! Emily, this has to stop. You cannot say those things no more. I can't say what I'm thinking and what I'm feeling every fucking day? - Sy, for God's sake! - I can't force her out. Yeah? Well maybe you can't... Sometimes I feel so happy Hey, can I have another? Thanks. Sometimes I feel so happy But mostly you just make me mad Baby, you just make me mad Linger on Your pale blue eyes Linger on Your pale blue eyes Oh, fuck! James, get out of the car. Now! Oh, God. Come with me. You care to explain how Mrs. Frigo's rhododendron got here? Good morning. What's this, mister? What the hell is wrong with you? You know, I think that Adventureland has made you regress or something. You're quitting that job. - I never want to go back there again. - Good. How much have you saved? 1,322, give or take. Well, the front axle is broken, but that might cover the damage. And you're gonna have to pay for Mrs. Frigo's rhododendron, too. I need every cent of that for New York. Well, I'm sorry, you know, you should have thought about that before you went out on this little joyride of yours. Brennan, I'm back. Thank God. How the hell are you? Well, Europe changed me. It was revelatory. There I was, going from one incredible city to the next. The ruins, the cathedrals, the endless art treasures. And I realized something. Fuck the Old World. I want the New World. - What? - And I want it now! - What do you mean? - I'm going to Harvard Business. You're what? You're applying? No, I'm in, actually. You know, strings were pulled, wheels greased. Wait, that's in Boston. What about New York and the apartment? Yeah. Sorry about that, man. I can't really help you out there. Hey, litterbug. Hey! In the clown mouth. These guys. - Hey, Bobby, Paulette. - Hey, Brennan. Hey, how are you? You know, we're just... It's the last weekend of the season. Just getting ready for winter, closing up shop. We have to turn all these lights off. - Your check's in the office. - Okay. We gonna see you next summer? Thank you, Bobby, for everything. Really. - Gonna see you next summer. - Well, thank you, really. We're halfway through our set, and we see him. It's fucking Lou Reed. - Oh, my... - Holy shit! Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I keep thinking I'm about to wake up any second. And he gets up, gets on stage, puts on a guitar, and we do a whole fucking set of his songs. - We do Vicious, Shed A Light On Love. - Oh, my God. - What a pisser. - We do I'm Waiting For The Man. Wait, hold on, one second. - Hey, last paycheck? - Yep. So, how's it going? - Ronnie found out everything. - Sorry. Yeah, it was bad. It's blown over now, mostly. Hey, do you speak to Em? Not since she quit. You? You know the song is called Satellite of Love, the Lou Reed song. You said Shed A Light On Love, but it's Satellite. - Yeah, I know. It's Satellite Of Love. - Yeah, it's like Skylab. Yeah, I know, it's... Yeah, it's called Satellite Of Love. Yeah. Take care of yourself, Brennan. Yeah, you, too. - Where were we? - You were telling us about the... - Satellite Of Love. - Yeah. Yeah. That's what we were talking about. That's my favorite one! Yeah, it's a good tune. Yes! We got the Viet Cong, fellas. We got the Viet Cong here! I need suppressive fire, but I can handle it. I think I got this under control. - Your friend Eric boned you, huh? - Yeah. How are you gonna pull off New York now? I can't pull it off. I'm stuck here. What's the point of being a writer or an artist anyway? Herman Melville wrote fucking Moby Dick, and he was so poor and forgotten by the time he died that in his obituary, they called him Henry Melville. You know? Like, why bother? They're just gonna forget our fucking names anyway. Viet Cong, Viet Cong! I'm coming! I got it! I heard Em went back to New York. I wish it didn't end like that. I should've... I don't know. Get behind me. Boom! I got 2! There's 1! There's 2! What's that? Boom! Boom! Boom, baby, boom! Your Herman Melville story, that's bullshit. It's true. They called him Henry. No, I mean he wrote a 700- page allegorical novel about the whaling industry. I think he was... I think he was a pretty passionate guy, Joel. I hope they call me Henry when I die, too. Yeah? One can only hope. Brennan, don't get all drunk and fall asleep. - Why? - Because I'll jack off on your face. - Okay, I'm gonna go. - What? I'll see you around, Frigo. All right. Good luck with him. Even. Good one! That was nice, Brennan. That was nice. That must have hurt. Look me in the eye Then tell me that I'm satisfied Hey, are you satisfied? And it goes so slowly on Everything I've ever wanted Tell me what's wrong Look me in the eye And tell me that I'm satisfied Were you satisfied? Hi. I just got off the bus. I'm a New Yorker now. I guess I should probably buy an umbrella. I don't think I can see you. What? This summer was rough. I did things that I really, really regret. Yeah, me, too. I'm sorry I told Lisa P. about you and Connell. She, you know, told the rest of the world, but... I'm not gonna lie. I was really angry at you, but you didn't deserve that. You know, James, I am so sorry for fucking this up. You know, you were the only good thing that happened this summer. Wait, Em. I think I maybe see you a little differently than you see yourself. Yes, I see the person who fucked up, but I also see the person who saved me from being knifed over a giant- ass panda, who introduced me to psychotropic- chocolate- chip cookies, and who stood up for Joel, and who doesn't make apologies for herself. Look, my theory is you can't just avoid everybody you screw up with. And you should trust me. I'm a New Yorker. - You are soaking wet. - Yeah. Do you have anything else you can wear? I'll check. - Do you want some tea? - Yeah. No, everything in here is soaking wet. - Here. - Thanks. So you're going to Columbia? No. No. Maybe next year. No. Why? I wrecked my dad's car, and I lost all my carny money. So what's the plan? I'm gonna crash at the Y for a week. I'm gonna look for a shitty job and... I don't know. Here. Give me your shirt. - I'll get you another shirt. - Thanks. Hey, Em. I really missed you. You wanna wear this? I... No. No. I never wanna see that again. Why do you have that? Why do you have that stupid shirt? Is it okay that I did that? Yeah. - Are we doing this? - I think so. Okay, we are? Okay. Okay.

58,2009, New in Town,American,"A high-powered consultant (Renée Zellweger) in love with her upscale Miami lifestyle is sent to New Ulm, Minnesota, to oversee the restructuring of a blue-collar manufacturing plant. After enduring a frosty reception from the locals, icy roads and freezing weather, she warms up to the small town's charm, and eventually finds herself being accepted by the community. When she is ordered to close down the plant and put the entire community out of work, she's forced to reconsider her goals and priorities, and finds a way to save the town. After tasting her secretary's secret recipe of tapioca pudding, she decides to adapt a former yogurt production line to produce this special recipe of tapioca.",8.2,tt2246779,"New in town is filmed in front of a live studio audience. Hi! Hello! Hi! how are you? Thank you. That's very nice of you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. That's so nice of you. I hope you're having a good week. Thank you for being here. I am doing well myself. In a couple days, i'm gonna turn years old And i'm very excited about that. I was hoping by now that i would look older But it didn't happen. I don't look older, i just look worse, i think. Honestly, when i'm walking down the street, No one's ever like ""hey! Look at that man."" I think they're just like ""Whoa! That tall child looks terrible."" Get some rest, tall child. You can't keep burning the candle at both ends. You ever seen on america's most wanted When they age a photo of someone? Just take my kindergarten photo and yellow the teeth And put bags under the eyes and be like, ""This is what he would look like now."" I was a very nervous kid. I was anxious all the time when i was younger. But what's nice is that some of the things i was anxious about Don't bother me at all anymore. Like, uh, i always thought That quicksand was gonna be a much bigger problem Than it turned out to be. Because if you watch cartoons, quicksand is like the third Biggest thing you have to worry about in adult life... Behind real sticks of dynamite And giant anvils falling on you From the sky. I used to sit around and think about What to do about quicksand. I never thought about how to handle real problems In adult life. I was never like, ""oh, what's it gonna be like When relatives ask to borrow money?"" Now i've gotten older. Not only have i never stepped in quicksand, I've never even heard about it. No one's ever been like ""hey, if you're coming to visit, ""Take i-90 'cause i-95 has a little quicksand in the middle. ""Looks like regular sand, But then you're gonna start to sink into it."" I was nervous all the time, but i had a good family. I have wonderful parents. A lot of guys my age, I'll hear them say this... They go, ""Every day i think i'm becoming more like my dad."" I think i'm becoming more like my mom Because i was watching that show access hollywood And one of the reporters said, ""Up next, we have an exclusive interview with sandra bullock's Former husband jesse james."" And out loud, i went ""ugh, this oughta be good!"" That's pure mom. My parents are both lawyers. They are both lawyers. And sometimes they would be like lawyers with us When we were kids. I remember one time i was in bed And my dad came in and he said, ""good night, john. Did you brush your teeth?"" And i said ""yes."" But here's the thing. I hadn't. But who cares? I didn't have like a job interview or anything. So my dad comes back in a couple minutes Holding my toothbrush. He says, ""john, is this your toothbrush? And i said, ""yes."" And he said, ""so we agree that this is your toothbrush."" Then he said, ""john, this toothbrush is bone dry."" Like, he looked down and he said, ""bone dry."" He said, ""you lied to me."" I said, ""dad, i did not lie. ""I said that i brushed my teeth. ""I never specified that i brushed my teeth tonight. ""And if the court reporter reads back my remarks, You will see that i did not perjure myself."" My mom's also a lawyer. She was a different kind of lawyer with us When we were kids. My mom was more like nancy grace. She would just make wild accusations all day long And wait for something to stick. My mom would blame me for things that happened On the news. That is true. I woke up one morning when i was a kid And my mom was standing over my bed. And she said, ""i just heard that princess diana and her lover Dodi al-Fayed have been killed in paris"" Like i had something to do with it. I was like, ""mom, i have been here all night. You can feel the tv. It's warm."" Luckily, i had a good alibi since i was in wisconsin and 12. My brothers and sisters and i had this babysitter Named veronica when we were kids, And i was in love with her. I was in love with veronica. She would babysit us on saturday nights. And in my head, when i was a little kid, I thought that veronica was like 25, years old. I was just talking to my mom the other week. I found out that when i was 10, veronica was 13. So why was she in charge? All she could do was dial the telephone a little better Than i could. when i'm 10? That's just like hiring a slightly bigger child. That would be like if you're going out of town for the week And you paid a horse to watch your dog. Like, ""all right, here is the number where we'll be, ""And here's where we keep the dog food. ""And you're a horse. ""Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."" Why do people do that? People always shush animals. They go, ""hey, shh, shh, shh."" They've never spoken. I always wanted to live in new york when i was a kid. I'm so excited that i get to live in new york. I saw new york city in a movie when i was a kid. It was called home alone 2: lost in new york. It is a sequel. Yeah, how about that movie? It was a sequel to the movie home alone. I remember in that movie... Oh, the kid in home alone 2. He gets into a stretch limousine on 5th avenue With a large cheese pizza, and i thought, ""This is the height of luxury!"" Now i live in new york and i'm psyched, But that is a stupid movie title. Lost in new york? The streets are numbered. How'd you get lost in new york? I know it's kind of stupid to complain about a movie That came out years ago. But i wasn't a comedian back then. So i have to do it now. I wish i'd been. I wish i'd been a def jam comic when that movie came out. I would have torn it to pieces. Be like, ""you seen this shit? ""You seen this home alone 2: lost in new york shit? ""It's a grid system, motherfucker. ""Where you at? 24th and 5th? ""Where you wanna go? 35th and 6th? up and over, you simple bitch!"" That'd be my big joke. That'd be the closer. If i was a def jam comic when that movie came out. But alas, i was not. I think the bullying that young people have to go through now In schools is really rough. I really sympathize, 'cause i was bullied when i was a kid. When i was in grade school, I was bullied for being asian-American. And the biggest problem with that... Is that i am not asian-American. But when i was younger, and this is absolutely true, People thought that i might be asian-American. I have pretty thin eyes. I had very thin eyes when i was a little kid And i had straight black hair that i wore in a bowl cut. And from the ages of three to eight, People thought that i might be a young chinese person. On the first day that he met me, The guy that is now my best friend... He met me the first day of kindergarten... He went home that night and said, ""Papa, today i met a boy with no eyes."" And that was me. Kids would make fun of me in middle school. Kids would call me a ""china man."" Which, of the racial slurs, has got to be the laziest. That is just pushing two words together. No work was done there. It was very confusing to me 'cause i'm not chinese. No one in my family is remotely asian. I mean, we take our shoes off when we come inside, But that was more of a carpeting thing than anything else. Here's how bad it got though. I remember when i was in junior high, We had this music appreciation class that we never appreciated. And they took us to hear some classical music once At a symphony orchestra. So we go to a symphony orchestra. In one of these classical pieces, There's a moment where they bang a gong. And every time they banged the gong, All the kids sitting in front of me would stand up Turn to me and bow like that. Which is some racist-Ass bullshit... But also incredibly well coordinated... For a group of 13-Year-Olds. 13-Year-Olds are the meanest people in the world. They terrify me to this day. If i'm on the street on like a friday at 3:00 p.M. And i see a group of eighth graders On one side of the street, I will cross to the other side of the street. Because eighth graders will make fun of you But in an accurate way. They will get to the thing that you don't like about you. They don't even need to look at you for long. They'll just be like ""ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! ""Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! ""Hey, look at that high-Waisted man. He got feminine hips."" And i'm like ""no! That's the thing i'm sensitive about!"" When i was a boy, i was also confused With a woman sometimes over the phone. Because before i went through puberty, I had a voice like a little flute. I was once on the telephone with blockbuster video, Which is a very old-Fashioned sentence. And...It is. I was on the telephone with blockbuster video. That's like when your gram would be like, ""We'd all go play jacks down at the soda fountain."" And you're like, ""no one knows what you're talking about, You idiot."" You know how you talk to your grandma? So... I was on the phone with blockbuster. I'd called them a couple of times in one day To ask about a movie. And i called for a third time. I said, ""hey, yeah. I was just calling to see If you had addams family values yet."" And the guy at blockbuster went, ""hey, lady... I'll tell you when we get addams family values."" But look, i wasn't offended as a boy being confused With a lady. I was offended as a lady who was getting pushed around By this chauvinist asshole that works at blockbuster video, Talking to me like i'm some floozy. I am a proud asian-American woman And you will treat me with respect. I am a tiger mom. Now when people make fun of me, I deserve it. Uh, i do. When people get mad at me now, it's my fault. When people get mad at me on the highway, That's all my bad. I'm a terrible driver. I know nothing about cars. I mean to learn about cars, and then i forgot. Nothing that i know can help you with your car ever. Unless you're like, ""hey, i've got a flat tire. Does anyone here know a lot about the cosby show?"" And then i could be like, ""oh, perhaps i could be Of some assistance."" I'm one of the worst drivers i have ever seen, And i just want you all to know That if you're ever on the highway behind me, Uh, i hear you honking and i also don't want me To be doing what i'm doing. I don't like that i'm in that lane either, And i sure would like to get out of it. I was on the highway in texas recently Which was like a highway filled with 13-Year-Olds. And i was in the far left lane. And i was going in the far left lane And then it turned into a u-Turn only lane. And i started to make a u-Turn, but then i panicked 'Cause i didn't wanna make a u-Turn. So i put the car in reverse and then merged right Back onto the highway. The best thing about that was that, after that, Cars were pulling up and looking over To see who just did that piece of shit move, Expecting to see like a 100-Year-Old blind dog Who's texting while driving and drinking a smoothie. Instead they see a 28-Year-Old healthy man trying this best. It's wrong to make fun of people, you know, But it's so fun sometimes. I've written for some tv shows, And, you know, on a major tv show, You have to be careful about what you say about people 'Cause a lot of people get offended, Or so it has been explained to me. I was once... I'll tell you this. I was writing for an awards show once, And i got into some trouble. I wrote a joke for this awards show That had the word ""midget"" in it. And someone from the network came down to our offices And he said to me, ""Hey, you can't put the word 'midget' on tv."" And i said, ""i sure would like to."" And he said, ""no, 'midget' is as bad as the 'n' word."" First off, no. No, it's not. ""Do you know how i know it's not,"" i said to him, ""Is because we're saying the word 'midget' ""And we're not even saying what the 'n' word is. ""If you're comparing the badness of two words, ""And you won't even say one of them... That's the worse word."" Also, i don't mean to gloss over What, like, little people have been through in this country, But you cannot compare the plight of midgets To african-Americans. That is outrageous. Midgets were never enslaved, Unless you count the wonka factory. So we get into this argument, we're going back and forth. He goes, ""you can't put that word on tv."" And i said, ""i want to."" And he goes, ""if you put that word on tv, There could be a protest of midgets on this building."" And i said, ""promise?"" How tempting would that be? I don't mean to complain about censorship at all though, Because as you probably have seen by now, You can basically say whatever you want on television. It's ridiculous. You can say anything you want. And if you don't believe me, You should watch a little program called Law  order: special victims unit. Yeah. A show that i love. Because on that show, you can say the grossest things You've ever heard in your life. No, you can't say like the ""f"" word. You can't say that on special victims unit. But people walk around on svu going like, ""Looks like the victim had anal contusions. ""Yo, looks like we found semen and fecal matter In the victim's ear canal."" Those are two real things that i heard On law  order: svu at 3:00 in the afternoon, Both spoken by ice-T. Ice-T is a detective with the special victims unit. He handles new york's most sensitive cases. I love ice-T on svu. He is fantastic. He's awesome. What's so great about him Is that he's been with the svu for like, mm, years now. But he still treats every case like it's his first In terms of total confusion. Sometimes they'll be in the middle of an investigation And ice-T will be like, ""yo, you telling me this dude Gets off on little girls with pigtails?"" It's like, ""yeah, ice. ""He's a pedophile. ""You work in the sex crimes division. You're gonna have to get used to that."" You know how they try and tie in, like, current events To every episode of svu? So there was this episode i saw a while ago That was about sex addiction. 'Cause a lot of celebrities have come out as sex addicts. So the episode's about sex addiction. There is a scene in the episode where the other detectives Are trying to teach ice-T what sex addiction is, And it takes a couple of minutes. And finally, ice-T gets it. And they cut to him in this close-Up And he goes, ""oh, i get it. ""You mean like when someone drinks too much... Or snorts cocaine...or bets the house on the ponies?"" I was like, ""yeah, you got it, man,"" And i was psyched that ice-T understood So that they could continue with the investigation. But i could've watched another four hours Of ice-T just naming examples. Just that close-Up and ice-T like, ""Or like when someone smokes too many cigarettes? ""Or like when someone shops too much with credit cards? ""Or like when someone plays too many scratchy lotteries? ""Or like when someone eats too much chocolate cake? ""Or like when eats too much chocolate cake And then barfs it up?"" And he would just keep talking and it would slowly fade out And say, ""executive producer dick wolf."" That'd be my ideal episode. That'd be a good one. I saw this svu a little while ago. I saw this episode of svu, And dean cain was a rapist... On the show. And there was a scene where they do a lineup With dean cain and four other guys. And they bring in this woman who's gonna look at the lineup And it's her behind the glass and they open the curtain And she's standing with the two other detectives. And i knew she wasn't gonna say this, But part of me was hoping she would just be like... ""Is that dean cain? ""Fucking dean cain? That's pretty cool."" I also watch the show called cold case files. On cold case files, they solve old murders And it's really interesting. 'Cause what i learn from it is that it was really easy To get away with murder before they knew about dna. It was ridiculously easy. Like, what was even going on back then? What was a murder investigation like in 1935? One cop would just walk in and be like, ""detective, We found a pool of that killer's blood in that hallway."" And he would just be like, ""hmm, gross. ""Mop it up. ""Now then, back to my hunch. ""Hmm... ""Look for clues. ""I'll tell you what we'll do. ""We'll draw chalk around where the body is. That way, we'll know where it was."" A couple years ago, i saw this movie called public enemies With johnny depp. It was about old bank robbers and stuff. Here's how easy it was to get away with bank robbery Back in the '30s. As long as you weren't still there When the police arrived, You had a 99 chance of getting away with it. To the point that, like, those old bank robbers, They take credit for the bank robberies. Like, they come running out of there And they're like, ""ha, ha, ha! ""And if anyone asks, you tell 'em it was golden joe And the suggins gang!"" And then they like shoot ""suggins"" Into the side of the wall. It's like, what? Were bullets free back then? And they don't even disguise themselves. They dress up for the bank robbery. They're rolling in there in, like, big suits and hats Like they're going to church in atlanta. They make a day of it. I don't know about that. Oh, ho ho. Oh, good, it has a mind of its own. That's very reassuring. No, no, no, no. I don't like robots... thinking of things. Hope you don't mind that i dressed up. It was my first communion today, So i decided to come right from it. I was a very good first communicant. Thank you for coming to this show by the way. I really do appreciate you coming to a thing, Because you didn't have to, and it's really easy Not to go to things. It is so much easier not to do things than to do them, That you would do anything is totally remarkable. Percentage-Wise, it is 100 easier not to do things Than to do them. And so much fun not to do them! Especially when you are supposed to do them. In terms of like instant relief, Cancelling plans is like heroin. It is an amazing feeling. Such instant joy. Kids don't like that. Kids always wanna do stuff. Kids get angry. They go, ""aw, we didn't do anything all day."" You ever ask an adult what they did over the weekend And they say they didn't do anything, their faces light up. Be like, ""what'd you do this weekend?"" ""I, um...i did nothing. I did nothing at all. Did we do anything? No, i didn't do anything."" People especially don't wanna do their jobs. I've found that out recently too. I have a friend named megan. She's an elementary school teacher. And i was out with her one night And she was drinking like a monster. And i said to her, ""don't you have to do a shift At school tomorrow?"" And she went, ""ahh, i'll just show a video."" And i was like, ""that's why teachers show videos?"" She said this, she goes, ""yeah, i don't wanna work!"" And i was like, ""you know, The kids don't wanna work either."" And she was like, ""good!"" I really do...I was psyched to do it in new york. I'm really happy to live here, And was glad that we could do it in new york city. And i'm not sure how you all got here tonight, But i did wanna say this. I've never been killed by hit men. So i don't know what it's like in the moments just before You're killed by hit men. But i bet it's not unlike when you're on the subway And you realize that a mariachi band Is about to start playing. Just that brief moment where you're reading And you're like, ""oh, a guitar player. ""Oh, another guitar player. Oh, an accordion player. oh, nooo.""  this is the loudest thing in the world  I was really excited a lot of people showed up. They told me that it was a big theater And i thought that no one would come. So thank you for coming. I wanted to like take ads out in the paper. Like, be...You know, do something to a tot So i get in the new york post or something. The new york post is my favorite news paper. I think it's great. I read it every day. I like reading the new york post Because reading the new york post Is like talking to someone who heard the news And now they're trying to give you the gist. It's like you'd get the same amount of information If you grabbed someone on the street, And you were like ""what happened today?"" They're like ""there's a perv in queens!"" You'd be like ""all right, thank you."" Or rather, it's like someone read a better newspaper And now they're trying to text you Everything they can remember. Doesn't have to be right. Just has to be short. I really do love the post. I read it a lot and there's a hierarchy In the new york post. Different people that they like And different people that they don't like. And if you pay attention, you can start to identify Some of the new york post rankings that they have. The number one thing that you can be In the eyes of the new york post is an angel. An angel is a child who has died. That is the best thing that you can be In the eyes of the new york post. The less amount of time you live, the better... In the eyes of the post. After that, under an angel is a hero. A hero is any man who does his job. You'll a lot of times see headlines that are like ""Hero tutor teaches after school."" And you're like, ""yeah."" Down towards the bottom of the spectrum, There are pervs. Pervs touch tots. Tots are angels who haven't died yet. There are no children in the eyes of the new york post. You're either a tot or you're dead and you're an angel. I did leave one out. Sorry. Above perv is a bozo. A bozo is any man who cheats on his wife. That guy's a bozo. I remember seeing a headline When tiger woods cheated on his wife. And it says, ""tiger says he's sorry, ""But elin says 'beat it, bozo.'"" No, she did not. She is from another country. And even if she was from this country, No one has said ""bozo"" in 1,000 years. Who was your source on that, new york post? Some tiny old lady that chain smokes all day long? They met her in a parking garage And they were like, ""madge, give us the scoop. What did elin say to tiger?"" ""She told him to 'beat it, bozo.'"" I'm feeling good tonight, though. I got a massage recently. Went to a spa to get a massage. I went into the room to get the massage And the woman there told me to undress to my comfort level. Those were her words. She said, ""i'm gonna leave the room. You undress to your comfort level."" So i put on a sweater and a pair of corduroy pants, And i felt safe. I'm trying to, in general, take better care of myself. I'm trying to stop smoking. I've smoked since i was years old. I started when i was years old 'Cause i stole two cigarettes from my older sister And i hid them in a shoebox under my bed With a copy of cosmopolitan magazine. And one day, my mom cleaned under my bed, And she found the shoebox. I came home from school and my mom was standing there Holding it and she said, ""hey, mister! I found your treasure!"" And i never liked the way she phrased that, you know. 'Cause that made me sound like the world's lamest pirate. Like, a guy whose treasure chest is two cigarettes And a woman's magazine. And my dad came home from work, and my mom told my dad That she had cleaned under my bed And found a shoebox with two cigarettes And a cosmopolitan, which prompted my dad to ask, ""How does john know how to make a cosmopolitan?"" I'm trying to eat better. I was out to lunch with a friend and i got a chicken sandwich. And the waitress said to me, ""Oh, you're getting a chicken sandwich. Well, that comes with a choice of either salad or fries."" Those were the choices... Salad or fries. The two most different foods in the universe. That's like saying what kinda day do you wanna have? Do you wanna be active and go to the bathroom and stuff? Or do you wanna lay on the floor moaning? ""Oh, you're getting a chicken sandwich? ""Well, with that, you can either go for a jog Or smoke crack cocaine."" ""Oh, huh, well... ""If i got a plate of crack for the table, ""Would you have some? ""You'd have crack if i got a plate of crack? Yeah, okay. Yeah, we'll take an order of crack."" Sometimes when people order fries, They act like it's a little adventure. They'll be like ""should we get a plate of fries for the table? ""Should we do it? Should we share some fries?"" They gotta make sure that everyone's onboard with it. It's like, ""if i get fries, you'll have a couple, right? ""If i get fries for the table, you'll have... ""I know you'll have fries if i get fries. ""Should we do it? Yeah, let's be bad. ""Come on, let's do it. All right. We're gonna take a plate of fries."" It's like a group of couples agreeing to do ecstasy together. I have a girlfriend now myself Which is weird because i'm probably gay based on the way I act and behave, and... I've walked and talked for years. I think i was supposed to be gay. I think like in heaven they built, like, 34 of a gay person And then they forgot to flip the final switch, And they just sent me out and it was like, ""You marked that one gay, right? And it was like, ""oh, no! Was i supposed to?"" And they were like, ""oh, man. ""This'll be a very interesting person. This'll be a very silly person."" I was definitely gay when i was a little boy. A lot of little boys are gay. You know, they're very flowy And they have hard opinions on things. I don't mean that i was a sexually active gay man When i was a little boy, that's not what i mean. When i was a little boy, i was more like a 67-Year-Old Gay man that's kinda over it, sexually, you know. I was just like an old queen. I would come out of the recess yard and be like, ""Everyone get outta my way. I just wanna sit here and feed my birds."" The gym teacher would tell me to play kickball And i'd be like, ""you want me to do what?"" Real quick, this happened pretty recently. I was in a restaurant near here in the west village, And i was at the urinal and an old gay man Came in the bathroom with a walker like this. And he said this to me. He went, ""i'm either having a drink or i have to pee. You're living the golden years, kid, not me."" Like he spoke in rhymes. It was crazy. It was such a weird interaction that i wasn't sure If it actually happened. I came out of the bathroom and i asked my girlfriend. I was like, ""did you see like an old man Follow me in the bathroom?"" And she was like, ""john, that bathroom's been closed ""For years. Whooooa! Whooooa!"" Where was i? I'm not gay, but i might be. And i have a girlfriend and she's a female person. It's going very well. I love her very much. And so a few months ago, she was like, ""Okay, it's going well, so now i should meet your parents."" Because that's what people do when a relationship Is going well. They meet each other's parents. And i've never understood that. I've never been with my girlfriend And thought like, ""oh, honey, ""Tonight is going great. ""But do you know what would make it perfect? Charles and ellen mulaney."" Come on! Let's get them in the mix. We've been going pretty hot and heavy lately, I think it's time we bring in two older catholic people. My girlfriend's a female, and then i had all these friends That are female. So when i started dating her, i was like, ""Oh, great, they'll all get along."" No. Not even a little at the beginning. I don't wanna make any generalizations about women 'Cause i don't know shit about women. But this one thing i've noticed In my own personal experience is that I think women can be friends with each other, But i think it can be tricky sometimes When you try and force women to hang out with each other. I think that sometimes doesn't work. Like, i don't think... Like, you could never put together a heist of women. Does that make sense? Like ocean's eleven with women wouldn't work. 'Cause two would keep breaking off To talk shit about the other nine. Or not even talk shit, Just say weird passive-Aggressive things While they break into the casino. Just be like, ""oh, i love how you just wear anything."" My girlfriend's wonderful, though. I listen to everything my girlfriend says. I don't mean she bosses me around. I just listen to everything she says Because, before i had a girlfriend, I never had someone who's always standing next to me Who can just point out obvious things that are happening. Like, we'll be in a restaurant, And my girlfriend will be like, ""You ordered your food an hour ago. It should be here by now."" And i'm like, ""yeah, it should!"" It's like having a lawyer for everyday life. She'll be like, ""the bus driver shouldn't talk To you that way."" And i'm like, ""no, he shouldn't!"" Before i had a girlfriend, I had no standard for how i should be treated As a human being. You could do anything to me. I was just like a young motown singer. I was just shiny and dumb and easy to trick. I was like, ""oh, man, you gonna give me a whole 100 ""For all of my songs? Where do i sign, mr. Berry gordy?"" And now when i'm not with my girlfriend, You can still do anything to me. I will tolerate any treatment. Like, i travel alone sometimes, you know. And i'll put up with anything. Like, i'll book a ticket on some garbage airline. You know, i don't wanna name an actual airline, So let's just make one up. Let's call it like delta airlines. So i'll book a ticket on delta airlines. And i'll show up at the airport. And i go, ""can i get on the plane now, please?"" And they go, ""no, it's delayed nine hours."" And i go, ""okay."" And then i go to the bathroom. And then i come out of the bathroom, And i go, ""any updates?"" And they go, ""yeah. ""We took off while you were in the bathroom... ""Because we hate you. ""Now take this meal voucher that doesn't work. Go, fetch!"" And i go, ""okay."" And i go over to the wolfgang puck express And i go, ""can i have a sandwich please? And they go, ""no!"" And i go, ""okay."" And they go, ""you're a little fat girl, aren't you?"" And i go, ""no."" And they go, ""say it!"" And i go, ""i'm a little fat girl."" And then i go over to the delta help desk Which is an oxymoron and i go, ""Can i please go home on an airplane?"" And they go, ""no. ""In fact, we're gonna frame you for murder. And you're gonna go to jail for years."" And i go, ""why are you doing this to me?"" And they go, "" because we're delta airlines   and life is a fucking nightmare "" But with my girlfriend she would just be like, ""Let's see if southwest has any flights."" So it's better. My girlfriend is a jewish woman. Which is... I did on purpose. Uh, that sounded creepy. I don't mean like ""ah, i got one!"" I mean like i... Uh, i am not jewish. But i've always really liked jewish people. I just like them a lot, And i really like dating jewish women. They're great. Because, like, i think a lot of problems That people have in relationships Are with communication 'Cause guys don't know what women are thinking. And with jewish women, You do not have to guess what they are thinking. They will tell you. Yeah, this is gonna get playfully anti-Semitic, So just allow it to go there. Allow...I'll get in trouble. You won't. I really do mean this, though. I really admire that jewish people, In my own personal experience, Have...Are very, like, upfront with their feelings. You know, they're very vocal About their thoughts and feelings. And i think that's really admirable. You know, i'm irish. And irish people, they don't tell you a thing. Irish people keep it so bottled up. You know, like, the plan with irish people is like, I'll keep all my emotions right here. And then one day, i'll die. Like, in ireland, it's like, ""ah, your boy has died."" And it's like, ""all right, bury the boy. ""Do it, bury the boy. Bury the boy."" Irish people don't want comfort. Look at a sweater made in ireland. It's like a turtleneck made out of brillo pads. I used to date gentile women and...They... I dated this girl. She'd just stare out the window all day long. And i'd be like, ""what's wrong?"" She'd be like, ""you wouldn't even understand if i told you."" What the fuck am i supposed to do with that? My jewish girlfriend, i don't have to guess what's wrong. She comes in the room and she's like, ""my stomach hurts!"" And then we can move on from there. That's what i mean. She's very focused. She's very in the moment, you know. And that's a good thing in a significant other. She's very present. Jews don't daydream, 'cause folks are after 'em And they gotta stay sharp, you know what i mean? They have to be there. They haven't let their minds wander since egypt. They just stay sharp. They go, ""who's that? Who are you? ""What's that? Put that down. What's that over there? Don't do that."" I'm irish. I keep things very bottled up, and i don't drink. Which is not what you're supposed to do When you're irish. I don't drink. I used to drink and then i drank too much And i had to stop. That surprises a lot of audiences Because i don't look like someone who used to do anything. I look like i was just sitting in a room in a chair Eating saltines for like years And then i walked right out here. But i did. I used to drink a lot and then i stopped. I don't know if anyone here is thinking about quitting drinking But you need to know two things if you're thinking about Quitting drinking. The first is that when you stop drinking, And you still go to parties where people are drinking, They will have no idea what to offer you. Once people start drinking for the night, They forget everything that isn't alcohol. Like, i'll show up at a party, and they'll be like ""Hey, everybody. All right. ""We got coronas in the fridge, and oh, hey, mulaney. ""Would you like, like, an old turnip ""That we found in a cabinet? ""Would that be good for you? Would you like that? ""I know you don't drink. ""Or my girlfriend left a nuva ring in the fridge. ""Would you want that? Would that be good for you? I know you don't drink."" Also, if you quit drinking, You're about to lose the best excuse You've ever had in your life, Which is, ""i'm really sorry about last night. I was just so drunk."" That is a get out of jail free card That you don't even realize you have Until you lose it. I can't say that anymore. I can never be like, ""i'm really sorry about last night. I was just so drunk."" Now i have to be like, ""I'm really sorry about last night. ""It's just that i'm mean and loud. It probably will happen again."" Now i, myself... I quit drinking 'Cause i used to drink too much And then i would black out and i would ruin parties. Or so i'm told. When you do that enough... When you black out drinking and you do crazy things, You kinda become like michael jackson. Like, any story anyone says about you might be true, And even you don't know by the end. I saw an interview with michael jackson before he died And they were like, ""Is it true you bought the elephant man's bones?"" And he was like, ""i don't know."" You know, 'cause how could he keep track of that? So i would hear stories about myself. Here's a story i once heard about me. I guess i was and i was at a party at someone's house And i had blacked out drinking, And someone came out of one of the rooms at this party Holding like an old antique bottle With some liquid in it, and they said, ""Hey, is this whiskey or perfume?"" And apparently i grabbed it, drank all of it, And said, ""it's perfume."" And it was. Another story i heard about myself... This one happened in high school. We had this teacher in high school Whose kid went to our high school. His name was mr. Mcnamara and his son jake mcnamara Went to our high school. He was a sophomore when i was a senior. So he was two years behind me. And mr. Mcnamara was an asshole. And one weekend, he and his wife Decided to leave town, Which you should never do if you're an asshole. And jake mcnamara decided to throw a party At the teacher's house. Hooray! And everyone around town heard about it And we all got up individually and thought, ""Okay, let's go over there and destroy the place."" I walked into this party. Everyone i had ever met was there. And everyone was drinking like it was the end of the world. People were drinking like it was the civil war And a doctor was coming to saw our legs off. It was totally unsupervised. We were like dogs without horses. We were running wild. I walked down... I walked down to the basement. They had a pool table in the basement. One dude took a running start And threw his body onto the pool table And broke it in half. Another kid found out which room was mr. Mcnamara's And went upstairs and took a shit on his computer. So the party was going great. I'm standing in the basement, And i'm holding a red cup you see in movies. And i'm standing there and i'm holding a red cup And i'm starting to black out and i guess someone said like ""Something something police."" And in a brilliant moment of word association, I yelled ""fuck da police! Fuck da police!"" And everyone else joined in. drunk white children Yelling ""fuck...da...po-Lice"" With the confidence of guys who have already been to jail And aren't afraid of it anymore. You know that like ""i served my nickel! You come and take me"" confidence. But white children. The reason someone had said ""something something police"" Was because the police were there. So a chicago police officer walked down the stairs And got to the bottom in the basement And looked out over a sea of drunk toddlers Yelling ""fuck the police"" in his face. And he was almost impressed. He was like ""wow."" And then he leaned into his walkie-Talkie And went ""get the paddy wagon."" And my friend john, who is now a father... This man now has a baby... He grabbed a 40, smashed it on the ground, And yelled ""scatter!"" And everyone ran in a different direction. We all ran in different directions. It was like that scene in ratatouille When the humans come in the kitchen And all the rats go in different ways. We all ran in different directions. I ran into the laundry room And i jumped up on the washing machine And i crawled out through a window into the backyard And now i'm running through the backyard And there was this big chain link fence And i thought i've never climbed a fence that high before. And then i woke up at home. On monday, i went to school. Because that's what we did back then. And i'm walking into the school building And who do i see but jake mcnamara. And he says to me ""Hey, were you at my party on saturday?"" And i said ""no."" You know, like a liar. And he said ""things got really outta hand. ""Someone broke the pool table. ""Someone took a shit on my dad's computer. But the worst thing"" he says... ""The worst thing is that someone stole these old ""Antique photos of my grandmother And my parents are freaking out about it."" And i had that thought That only blackout drunks and steve urkel can have. Did i do that? I figured no, i wouldn't have done that. But i was never sure, until two years later... Relax. I'm playing video games with this kid named alex That we also went to high school with. Two years later, we've graduated by now. We're playing video games for a couple hours, And then alex says to me, ""hey, come here. I wanna show you something."" And he takes me into his bedroom And then he takes me into a side room Off of his bedroom. Never a good thing to have. He shows me a tiny room that is covered wall to wall In stolen antique photos from different people's parties Over the years. And i said ""why? Why do you do this?"" And alex said ""Because it's the one thing you can't replace."" That's the end of that story, But how fucked-Up is that, right? That's crazy. So i don't drink anymore. And it's weird, you know. I miss it sometimes 'Cause drinking can kind of calm your nerves. And i live in new york now. And sometimes you see things that can make you anxious. You'll see troubling things out on the street. I was coming into my apartment building one night And i saw in front of my building A wheelchair knocked over on its side with no one in it. That's a bad thing to see. Something happened there. You hope it was a miracle. But probably not. Probably something worse. I don't like arguments. Some people like to argue. They think it's like an art. I don't like it. I think it's because really ordinary arguments Can get really dramatic really quickly. I was talking to friend recently, And i told him that i didn't think I believed in the death penalty. And my friend said to me, ""oh, so you're telling me ""That if you saw hitler walking down the street, You wouldn't kill him?"" I said ""that wasn't what i was telling you. ""But all right. Let's talk about this... ""Entirely new topic. ""What would i do if i saw adolf hitler just... Just walking down the street?"" Well, first off, i wanted to know what did my friend mean? Did he mean that i see a guy in like the military outfit With the little moustache? 'Cause then i would assume that That's someone dressed as hitler. I'm not gonna kill that guy. I'm not gonna kill an actor and ruin indiana jones v Just 'cause i don't understand costumes. Or does he mean that i'm walking down the street And i see like an old, old man who i think might be hitler Based on my memory of what hitler looks like? I'm not gonna kill that guy either because i am often wrong. I'd murder him and then people would run up and be like ""Whoa! You just killed an old, old, man!"" And then i'd be like ""he looked like hitler!"" And they're like ""yeah, a little."" I have a lot of strange interactions on the street. Years ago, i was walking down the street And a homeless guy came up to me And he walked up to me and he pushed me like that. He pushed me in the chest. And then he said these things in this order. Pushed me and he said ""excuse me, i am homeless. ""I am gay. I have aids. I'm new in town."" You're gonna close with ""new in town""? That is not the most dramatic thing that you just said. As they say in the movie jerry maguire, ""You had me at aids."" Here's how i would've ordered those things. I would've said ""excuse me. I'm new in town and it gets worse."" Didn't that guy practice his pitch at all In the mirror that morning And just figure out what he was gonna say? Just like in the morning just be like, ""All right, what am i gonna do today? ""What i'm gonna do? ""I'll walk up and say hello. No, that's too subtle. I'm gonna push him."" ""I'm gonna push him. ""And i'm gonna say, 'i'm new in town.' ""No, no, hold back. Hold back. Save it. Build to that."" I'll be like, i'll walk up to him, I'll push him. I'll go, ""i have aids."" No, that's too strong. All right. I'll walk up to him and...And i'll push him. I will start with the fact that i am homeless, As that is a given. Then, for a back story, I will pepper in the fact that i am gay. Which i know, it's tough for gay youths on the street, But that's not, like, a reason for money. You can't be like, ""hey, would you help me out? I'm very gay. I'd like a few dollars."" I always love how he phrased it, by the way. He didn't say, ""i'm living on the street."" He said, ""i'm new in town,"" Like it was intriguing. Like he wanted me to set him up with somebody. Like i have a friend who's like, ""There's no single guys left in manhattan."" And i'm like, ""i know someone who's new in town."" ""What are three other things about him?"" Just too anxious for a lot of things. I get very nervous all the time, Not even about, like, major life things. Just, like, about in everyday situations. Like, this is my regular speaking voice, But if i'm in a public bathroom And someone knocks too suddenly on the stall door, I go into a whole different speaking voice, Which is, ""someone's in here. Someone's in here,"" so they're gonna be like, ""I think there's a carnival barker in there. ""I think someone's trying to drum up business For a carnival."" I decided to do something about all this anxiety. Recently i decided i was gonna try and get A xanax prescription. I don't know if anyone here has ever tried xanax, But it's fantastic. Very muted claps for xanax. You don't really get ""whoos."" It's more like, ""yeeeeeaaaaah."" I didn't know how to get a xanax prescription, though. Drugs like that are tricky sometimes. But i talked to a friend of mine, and he said, ""Hey, i did this."" He said that he had a regular doctor's appointment, And at the end of it, he said to his doctor, ""Hey, doctor, sometimes i get nervous on airplanes,"" And the doctor just wrote him a xanax prescription. And i was like, ""yeah, that's the type of lowbrow shit ""I'm looking for. I'll take your advice, friend i've never listened to before."" So i go to a clinic and i go in, And i'm just gonna go in for, you know, A regular type of checkup, And at the end, i'll ask about xanax. So i get to the front desk, And they have a ""why are you here?"" Sheet. And i want to pick something That will get me in and out really quickly. And i look down and i see ""frequent urination,"" And i was like, perfect. That'll be a super quick visit, you know? I'll just be like, ""hey, sometimes i pee a lot,"" And the doctor will be like, ""me too. Crazy, right?"" And i'll be like, ""i get nervous on airplanes."" So i checked off ""frequent urination,"" And i sat down in the waiting area, And i waited for three hours. I finally go back to the observation room, And...Oh, in the observation room, There is a male nurse standing there, And he has a batman sticker on his stethoscope, A batman necklace, and a batman watch. He was kind of moving around the whole time. You know, he was just like, ""all right. ""I am too blessed to be stressed. Let's do it. What are you allergic to, besides work?"" And then he'd take something And he'd throw it over his shoulder And be like, ""beats workin'."" Like, all of his jokes were very anti-Work, Which is not always what you want From a healthcare professional. The doctor comes in the room, And the doctor looks at my chart, And he says, ""oh, you're here for frequent urination. How many times a day are you urinating?"" And i tried to think of a number That would warrant a doctor visit, So i said 11, And that was too many times to say. The doctor looks at me and he says, ""You're peeing times a day? ""Then you may have something wrong with your prostate, So what we need to do..."" Some of you are ahead of me. So i don't know exactly how he phrased it, But the gist of it was, ""hey, if this visit is to continue, I'm going to stick part of my hand up your ass."" And i didn't know what to say, 'Cause i couldn't be like, ""no, that's okay. ""I was lying. ""It was a lie. ""To get drugs. You know, like a crime."" So what i did was, i pulled down my pants And i walked over to the observation table, And i put my hands down on the observation table like this... And by the way, part of me was like, whatever, you know? You know those days when you're like, This might as well happen? Adult life is already so goddamn weird. So i'm bent over like this on the table, And the doctor comes up behind me. He goes, ""no, no, no, Not on your hands. On your elbows,"" And he knocks me down like that. And this is so much worse than this. I don't know why. I think it's that this has, like, A little remaining dignity to it, you know what i mean? This is sort of like, ""oh, stick it in. I am an american."" This is like you're leaning over the edge of a cruise ship And you're like, ""ah, we are approaching martinique."" But he knocked me down to my elbows, And then he stuck his hand in And, you know how sometimes you're like, ""I bet i know what most things feel like,"" you know? You just think you'll know. I did not know what this was gonna feel like. And this was the actual sound i made. I went, ""ohhhhhh."" But i didn't say it. Like, it came from my vocal cords, But it was totally involuntary. It was as if a ghost had been trapped in my belly And finally flew out towards the light. And then... When he pulled his hand out... We've gotten to know each other pretty well, So i will phrase this as delicately as i can. I did not realize that when the doctor pulls his hand out, It feels like you're shitting, because the only thing That's ever come out of your butt before has been shit. So, he pulls his hand out and i thought That i was shitting into his hand, So i yelled, ""i'm sorry!"" This is a very routine procedure, by the way, For most doctors, And so far, he's had to deal with ""ohhhhhh!"" And ""i'm sorry!"" And he didn't even let me off the hook, you know? He wasn't like, ""ah, don't worry. You didn't shit into my hand."" He just threw his glove away and was like, ""ahgahah."" And i was about to ask about xanax, But then he said, ""all right, your prostate's fine, But we still need to do a blood test."" So i pulled up my pants and shuffled away, Feeling different. And he yells out into the hall, He goes, ""hey, we're doing a blood test. Get in here."" And batman dances back in, and he's like, ""All right. We're gonna do a blood test. You look different. Let's do it."" The doctor left the room, so i'm alone with batman. I just need this blood test to be over, okay? But first i had to tell batman something. I said, ""batman, look, i'm one of those people ""Who when you take blood from me, ""Sometimes i can faint, ""And i was in the waiting area for three hours, ""And i haven't eaten all day, And i'm really worried i'm gonna faint."" And batman said to me, and i'll never forget it, ""Pssh! You're not gonna faint."" So i stick my arm out, Batman puts the needle in, I immediately collapse on the ground. I wake up and i am covered in sweat, Lying on the observation table. I wake up, i open my eyes, and i see batman's face. He's looking at me and he goes, ""you gotta go."" And i said, ""could i please talk to the doctor, though, first? Because sometimes i get nervous on airplanes."" And batman said, ""the doctor's gone."" So i got my stuff and i left. The moral of the story is, That if you've been nervous your entire life, You should ask your doctor about xanax, Because if you lie to him, He will stick his finger in your ass. And if you do suffer from frequent urination, Keep it to yourself. I went to that clinic two years later For a different checkup, and as i was leaving, Who did i run into but batman. And he smiled at me, And he was wearing reading glasses To show that time had passed. Thanks very much for listening to me. My name's john mulaney. You were really fun. Thank you. Thank you very much again. Thanks a lot. I really appreciate it. Thank you."
59,2006,The Departed,American,"As a child, Colin Sullivan had been introduced to organized crime by Irish-American mobster Frank Costello in the Irish neighborhood of South Boston. Over the years, Costello grooms him to become a mole inside the Massachusetts State Police, until Sullivan is accepted into the Special Investigations Unit, which focuses on organized crime.
Before graduating from the police academy, Billy Costigan is recruited by Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam to go undercover, as his family ties to organized crime make him a perfect infiltrator. He drops out of the academy and does time in prison on a fake assault charge to increase his credibility.
Each man infiltrates his respective organization, and Sullivan begins a romance with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden. Costigan is seeing her under the terms of his probation, and they begin a relationship, too. After Costello escapes a sting operation, each mole becomes aware of the other's existence. Sullivan is told to find the ""rat"" and asks Costello for information to identify the informer.
Costigan follows Costello into a porn theater, where Costello gives Sullivan an envelope containing personal information on his crew members. Costigan chases Sullivan through Chinatown. When it is over, neither man knows the other's identity. Sullivan has Queenan tailed to a meeting with Costigan on the roof of a building. Queenan orders Costigan to flee while he confronts Costello's men alone. The men then throw Queenan off the building to his death. When they exit, Costigan pretends he has come to join them. Television news reveals that crew member Delahunt has been an undercover cop, working for the Boston Police Department. Dignam resigns rather than work with Sullivan, who he suspects is the mole after he is asked why he had Queenan followed.
Using Queenan's phone, Sullivan reaches Costigan, who refuses to abort his mission. Sullivan learns from Queenan's diary of Costello's role as an informant for the FBI, causing him to worry about his own identity being revealed. With Costigan's help, Costello is traced to a cocaine drop-off, where a gunfight erupts between Costello's crew and the police, which results in most of the crew being killed. Costello, confronted by Sullivan, admits he is an FBI informant. Costello tries to shoot Sullivan, but Sullivan shoots him multiple times. With Costello dead, Sullivan is applauded the next day by everyone on the force. In good faith, Costigan comes to Sullivan for restoration of his true identity and to be paid for his work, but notices the envelope from Costello on Sullivan's desk and flees, finally realizing Sullivan is the enemy. Fearing retaliation, Sullivan erases Costigan's records from the police computer system.
Sullivan is unaware that Madolyn had an affair with Costigan when she tells Sullivan that she is pregnant. Later, Sullivan finds her listening to a CD from Costigan containing incriminating recorded conversations between Costello and Sullivan. Sullivan unsuccessfully attempts to assuage her suspicions. He then contacts Costigan, who reveals that Costello recorded every one of their conversations, that Costello's attorney left Costigan in possession of the recordings, and that Costigan intends to implicate Sullivan. The two agree to meet at the building where Queenan died.
On the roof, Costigan catches Sullivan off-guard and handcuffs him. As Costigan had secretly arranged, Trooper Brown appears on the roof as well. Shocked, Brown draws his gun on Costigan, who attempts to justify his actions by exposing Sullivan as Costello's mole. Costigan asks Brown why Dignam did not accompany him as Costigan had requested, but Brown does not answer. Costigan leads Sullivan, his hostage, to the elevator. When it reaches the ground floor, Trooper Barrigan shoots Costigan in the head, then shoots Brown, and afterward reveals to Sullivan that Costello had more than one mole in the police. Sullivan then shoots and kills Barrigan. At state police headquarters, Sullivan identifies Barrigan as the mole and has Costigan posthumously given the Medal of Merit.
At Costigan's funeral, Sullivan notices that Madolyn is tearful. As they leave the gravesite, Sullivan attempts to talk to her, but she ignores him. When Sullivan returns to his apartment, he is ambushed by Dignam, who shoots and kills him as he enters.",8.5,tt0407887,"I don't wanna be a product of my environment.

Guineas from the North End, down Providence... ...tried to tell me what to do. And something maybe happened to them. Maybe like that: Jeez. She fell funny. Francis, you really should see somebody. When you decide to be something, you can be it. That's what they don't tell you in the Church. When I was your age, they would say we could become cops or criminals. Today what I'm saying to you is this: When you're facing a loaded gun... ...what's the difference? That's my boy. Terminal ballistics is the study of a projectile... ...as it hits a target and the destruction that it causes. Take, for instance, what you carry, 9mm hollow-point. When the hollow-point hits the skull, what happens is it mushrooms. When it mushrooms it peels back. So you may have six, eight... ...ten little particles of the bullet that are like razor blades... Sir, yes, sir! ...tearing their internal organs, their liver, their lungs, their heart... ...bringing tissue, bone, blood, brain matter, and that's called a blowback. Fuck you. Fucking queers. Firemen getting pussy for the first time in the history of fire or pussy. Hey, go save a kitten in a tree, you fucking homos. Pencils. Begin. What are you looking at? Forget it. Your father was a janitor, his son's only a cop. Those fucking firefighters are a bunch of homos. They are. So she tells me, ""You never finish anything. You finish the police course... ...you get taken care of again, baby."" So after graduation, I get a blowjob again. That's great. Your mother must be a wonderful woman. Fuck yourself. Put it this way. You're a black guy in Boston. You don't need any help from me to be completely fucked. The Massachusetts State Police has a long tradition of excellence. Your graduation today solidifies your acceptance... ...into one of the finest law enforcement agencies in our nation. As the governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I am confident... ...each and every one of you will serve with distinction, honor and integrity. Congratulations to all our new troopers. Thank you. You are dismissed. Sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right out of the gate, congratulations. - We're going for a beer. You wanna come? - No, I'll catch up with you guys. School's out. Thank you, Frank. You earned it. No more pencils, no more books. All right. This is not the regular police... - ... this is the state police. - And fire! Your training will illustrate the difference. State police, search warrant! State police, open the door! What's the difference? - Go, go, go! - Sir, yes, sir! - Is that understood? - Sir, yes, sir! Move it, get the fuck down right now. Get down, right now. Congratulations on passing the detective's exam, and welcome... - ... to the Special Investigation Unit. - Whoop-de-fucking-do. We won't be working together, that is, directly. You'll be working for Captain Ellerby, but I like to see everybody. You're a worker. You rise fast. Like a 12-year-old's dick. - Thank you, sergeant. - My pleasure. - Thank you, sir. - Good luck. - Congratulations. - Thanks, hon. You can go in there now. You can sit. So... Do you know what we do here? My section? - Yes, sir, I have an idea... - Let's say you have no idea... ...and leave it at that, okay? No idea. Zip. None. If you had an idea what we do, we would not be good at what we do, would we? We would be cunts. Are you calling us cunts? Staff Sergeant Dignam has a style of his own. I'm afraid we all have to get used to it. So you have family connections down in Southie, right? Through your father? Why don't you tell us about your Uncle Jackie? He was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh. Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville. He got popped by Nicastro in '95. We found his body out by the airport. That's right. - I remember his funeral. - Oh, good. Closed casket? That's right. So tell anybody up at Deerfield... Before you got kicked out for whaling on a gym teacher with a chair. ...you had an uncle met his demise like that? I got a question. How fucked up are you? Hi, Darlene. What you got, staff sergeant? In no time you made sergeant. - SIU. What a country. - Perfect. Hey, I don't mind going it alone. You know, if you went alone once in a while you might get somewhere. We're cops, all right? This isn't somewhere. All right, lookit, I know you're a worker. Maybe I can do something for you. You got any suits, or do you like... ...coming to work dressed like you're gonna invade Poland? You got quite the family tree. That maggot uncle of yours... ...Tommy Costigan, is another goof. He gets busted selling guns... ...to federal officers, among many, many, many other departures... - ... from our normative behavior. - And what's this got to do with me? Why are you pretending to be a cop? This unit is new, and you are the newest members of it. You have been selected for it on the basis of intelligence and aptitude. This is an elite unit. Our job is to smash or marginally disrupt... ...organized crime in this city... ...by enhanced cooperation with the FBI... ...represented here today by Agent Frank Lazio. And we will do it. And by organized crime in this city, you know who we mean. That's Jackie Costigan. That's an old picture. Jackie met his demise. Last known photograph. Costello uses three key guys. That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho, lives in Brockton with his mother. She's straight out of Going My Way. Delahunt, muscle. French, the number one. But of course, the rock star, you-know-who. We've done a briefing book, so read up. I want all ideas... ...so I can pass them off as my own. Work hard, you'll rise fast. You're in the best possible position... ...in the department. Let's go to work. Your old man was a fucking hump from Southie. Baggage handler at the airport, right? Family's all criminals except for the old man, huh? And one priest, since you seem to know everything. Last I heard he was married to a 12-year-old boy, living on a beach in Thailand. Fucking family's dug into the Southie projects like ticks. Three-decker men at best. You, however, grew up... ...on the North Shore, huh? Well, la-di-fucking-da. You were kind of a double kid, I bet, right? One kid with your old man, one kid with your mother. You're upper-middle class during the weeks, then you're hanging... ...in the Southie projects with your daddy, the fucking donkey... ...on the weekends. I got that right? Yup. You have different accents? You did, didn't you, you little fucking snake? - You were like different people. - You a psychiatrist? If I was, I'd ask you why you're a statie making grand a year. And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud I wouldn't get an answer. Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker like you doing in the staties? Well, families are always rising or falling in America, am I right? - Who said that? - Hawthorne. What's the matter, smart-ass, you don't know any fucking Shakespeare? We have a question. Do you wanna be a cop, or do you wanna appear to be a cop? It's an honest question. Lot of guys want to appear to be cops. Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV. A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger through a window... I'm set without your own personal job application, sergeant. - What did you say? - Sir, what do you want from me? Hey, he can't help you. I know what you are. I know what you are... ...and I know what you're not. I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna help you understand something. You're no fucking cop. He's right. We deal in deception here. What we do not deal with is self-deception. Five years from now you could be anything else in the world. But you will not be a Massachusetts state trooper. - Are you sure of that? - I'm sure of that. Guaran-fucking-teed. You had on your SATs, kid. You're an astronaut, not a statie. You don't have much family. I don't have any family. What's this I hear from Stephanie about you becoming a policeman? Stephanie, who was the only one who came to my father's funeral? - That Stephanie? - Yeah, that Stephanie. - Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward. - Trying to prove something to the family? When you say ""the family,"" who do you mean exactly? You? You always have to question everything, don't you? Maybe it would've done you some good to have some questions from time to time. ""Am I an asshole? Are my kids a mess? Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?"" I mean, those are questions, right? ""Have I ever been good to my dying sister, or am I just now pretending to be?"" Do you need some money for the funeral? When my mother dies, we don't have any more connection. It's lovely. You get the high ceilings, the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive. The fridge has got an alarm in it in case you have... ...eating issues, which is a joke. Not a very funny one. Well, there's a great view of the State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it. I mean, you move in, you're upper-class by about Tuesday. - So you're a cop. - A state-police detective. A state-police detective. And are you a married state-police detective? No. Because this is kind of a... Sort of a big place and... I have a co-signer. Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend to have a houseguest. That's cool. Good. - Yeah, it's got... - Just give me the papers. Sure. Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon her. - Amen. - May she rest in peace. Amen. May her soul and the souls of all the faithful departed... ...through the mercy of God rest in peace. Amen. So what do I do? There's money behind this operation. You won't be paid as a regular cop... ...but there's a bonus involved. Tax-free. We can't conceal that you were a trainee. You'll be convicted of a crime. We're thinking a guilty plea to assault and battery would make sense. Given your nature. You'll do enough jail time to convince anyone this is no setup. You'll be on probation, see a court-ordered shrink... ...the whole nine yards. You wanna serve the Commonwealth, this is your chance. We need you, pal. You've already pretended to be a Costigan from South Boston. - Every weekend, sergeant. - Perfect. Do it again. For me. - Hey, you Billy Costigan? - Yeah, who wants to know? Well, nothing. I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street. - Yeah, that's my cousin. - Connected. Not too bright. - Yeah, I know. - I mean, no offense. - Billy? - Yeah, it's me. - Oh, my God. Good to see you. - Aunt Kathy, how are you? Oh, good to see you. Come on in. They said you was in the staties. I couldn't believe it. I got kicked out, like, four months ago. Yeah, it was in the papers. So you know. And why are we graced with your presence? I brought your mother some pictures of my father. - Look at the smile. - My mother had them. My... My mother's dead. I'm sorry. Sorry for your troubles. I was at a funeral myself, man. Myles Kennefick. Knew him in school. He was a young guy, you know? It's terrible. It's a shame. - You remember that. What a night. - Listen. I got, like... - Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money. - Yeah. You know, after my mother passed and everything. In your line of work, if I gave you... ...like, what, say, 10,000, what could I get back? You know what you... You know what you usually say at these moments. - What? What? - Come on, man. Oh, come on, you fucking moron. Come on. What, you want me to say it? I'm not a cop, all right? - I'm your fucking cousin. - You're bad. You corrupt fuck, man. You must be my cousin. Fucking Ricans think they know everything. If they knew shit, they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans. R is for Ricans P is for pigs Would you shut the fuck up for five seconds, huh? That's right. You used to be a cop. When we're working together just limit it to two eight-balls an hour. We're not even supposed to be doing this shit this close to Worcester. This side of Worcester. - Says who? - Says him. Says Costello. God says, as far as you're... ...concerned. No, no, he's no cop. He got out of the joint three weeks ago. - Cunt cop. - No, no, no. He talks like his shit don't stink, but he's good people. Well, I knew his father. - I liked his Uncle Jackie better. - Jackie was all right. Uncle Jackie was excellent. Fucking guineas. - To Jackie. - Uncle Jackie. Cranberry juice. It's a natural diuretic. My girlfriend drinks it when she's got her period. What, do you got your period? - Fucking...! - Get off! - Get your fucking hands off me! - Hey. Hey, hey. Do you know me? No. No. Well, I'm the guy that tells you there are guys you can hit... ...and there's guys you can't. Now, that's not quite a guy you can't hit... ...but it's almost a guy you can't hit. So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling on this right now: You don't fucking hit him. You understand? Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine. I fucking know you. I know your family. You make one more drug deal... ...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet of a cousin of yours... ...and I'll forget your grandmother was so nice to me. I'll cut your fucking nuts off. You understand that? Yeah. Yeah, I do. What are you drinking? A cranberry juice. What is it, your period? Get him a cranberry juice. Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew. What? ""Oh,"" fucking what? Get the fuck out of here. Sorry I'm late. Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison to the undercover section. His undercover work is extensive. He's here to give us his report. Sergeant Dignam. Okay, my people are out there. They're like fucking Indians. You're not gonna see them. You'll hear about them through me or Captain Queenan. You will not ever know the identity of undercover people. Unfortunately, this shithole has more leaks than the Iraqi navy. - Fuck yourself. - I'm tired from fucking your wife. - How's your mother? - Tired from fucking my father. Good. Today, girls... ...what I have is microprocessors. Somebody, as you may already know, stole microprocessors... ...from the Mass Processor Company out on Route 128. These are the kind they put into computers... ...that could put a cruise missile up the ass of a camel... ...from a couple hundred miles away. These pieces of plastic are worth about grand apiece. We got a guy working for the company two months... ...walks out the door with a box of processors on Tuesday... ...has a ticket for Florida on Wednesday... ...but on Thursday, he gets found in a Dumpster. You know where that dirtball started his life? Southie projects. - What was his name, the departed? - Myles Kennefick. Got the job with a forged UMass transcript. UMass, Boston... - ... which happens to... - South Boston? Oh, you're a fucking genius. Who forged your transcript, dickhead? His old man runs the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's. We're not here to solve the case of the missing scumbag. We're here to nail Costello. All right, look. We got a guy... ...says Costello's moving the processors to China. He set up the whole fucking job and popped Kennefick. You do not want to miss it if Costello takes a dump. We'd miss less if you made your informants available to us and the Bureau. Without asking for too many details, do you have anyone in with Costello now? Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself. My theory on Feds is they're like mushrooms. Feed them shit and keep them in the dark. You girls have a good day. Normally he's a very nice guy. Don't judge him from this meeting alone. Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son. I knew Myles. He was younger than me, but he was behind me in school. I wanna get these people who did this to him. Would you like to help us? You wanna help catch the people... ...who forced your son to do a robbery and then killed him? Allegedly. Allegedly. If he was killed, he probably did something wrong. But not the robbery. That's not wrong. He did something else wrong? Wave to your girlfriend, honey. I mean, fuck yourself. - Did you get that? - ""Allegedly"" or ""fuck yourself""? - Welcome to the neighborhood. - Different breed down here, sarge. I need a cup of coffee. You making a house call? Have I seen you professionally? No, no. No, I know who you are, though. I know. Guys gotta use their service revolver in the course of duty... ...and then they get to come to talk to you about their feelings and whatnot. No, no, I know how it goes. You're a mental health professional. I have an appointment on this floor. Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all frigging crazy on that floor. - I'm one more up. - Oh, fancy policeman. - Yeah, that's right, fancy. - Are you a statie? Yeah, I am. I'm actually going to law school also. Suffolk, nights? Yeah, they don't run Harvard at night, last time I checked. - When's the last time you checked? - Before I went to fucking Suffolk. Okay, listen, I went to UMass. I wasn't insulting you. Well, I thought you were. So now you gotta buy me dinner. Maybe you can shoot someone and then see me professionally. I'll stab someone in the heart with a fucking ice pick if it gets me dinner with you. That's all right. I'm a detective. I'll find you. No, sorry. I'm just joking. I need the card. Card helps. Nice to meet you, Madolyn. Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail until I saw it. No, I couldn't. I had the other guy with me, I couldn't... All right, it's a blue sedan and then a white van. It's fucked up with graffiti. And the van is the audio surveillance. All right, have a nice day. Cut him here. Bye-bye. Jerk-ass! Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore. I cannot hold off. Don't let me go back empty-handed. Don't do this. I wanna help you. Come to my store next Friday. I'll give you the money. This is Friday, Babu. How many times I gotta tell you? You keep on calling me Babu. It's Singh, motherfucker. I'm trying to help you. You keep telling me I'm your friend. You don't even know my fucking name. I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back again like last week. See this guy? You see this guy? This guy don't want you to have the money. Because he wants to come back there and squash your head. I have one customer sitting here. What I'm gonna do? Business is bad? You opened a store in an Irish neighborhood. These are dirty people. Don't you know that? Sell potatoes, I don't know what you're gonna do. - Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry. - Know what I'm saying? You fellas come from Providence? It isn't any of your business, is it, now? What, are you fucking delivering cannolis or something? Hey! You are killing my business, man! Fuck! What's wrong with this fucking country? Everybody hates everybody! Get out of here. Get out of here! - Now, you also do probation work, right? - That's right, I see violent offenders. - Oh, bad guys. - Not necessarily. Yeah, they got this but they don't got duck I'orange. Was your meal okay? Yeah, no, the lobster was good. I just, you know, because it was a French restaurant I was surprised. I'm waiting for you to make your move. Look, I don't know, if that thing moves, I'm gonna shoot it. I don't even know what it is. So what's it like having people find themselves... ...in your office all day long? Does it get messy with all those feelings flying around? Why, does that make you uncomfortable? - No, no, no. - No? No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch. Well, you know what Freud said about the Irish? Yeah, I do. Yeah, if you actually do, I'll see you again. Who says I wanna see you again? Don't you? - You should see your face. - Don't you? Course I wanna see you again. What Freud said about the Irish is... ...we're the only people who are impervious to psychoanalysis. - Yeah, he said that. - I know he did. So you're up shit's creek with a client list full of mick cops. I mean, opening up? Good luck to you. Why do you do it, then? Some people do get better. Fair enough. Sometimes I want people to forget their personal bullshit and do their jobs. Including the criminals? If they don't do their jobs, you don't have one. I'll always have a job. I'll just arrest innocent people. - Wait. You are trouble. - You don't know the half of it. I'll arrest you right now. My word against yours. ...then I see her dancing at the wedding with you-know-who. I say, ""Why don't you go to Parents Without Partners?"" He goes, ""Ma, they're all losers at the Parents Without Partners,"" so... So I say to him, ""Princess Carolina of Monaco..."" Schuyler. Do you know who I am? No. You met my friend Mr. French the other night. His real name Mr. French? No. Come with me. I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you. You know something, they just do not stop having the Mafia in Providence. And this can cause me a lot of problems. Those guys you tuned up... ...they're connected down Providence. What they're gonna do... ...is come back with some guys and kill you. Which, sure as you're born, they will do. Unless I stop them. Do you want me to stop them? Is this something I can't do personally? I'm gonna have my associate search you. No one's searching me. Search me for what? Contra-fucking-band. Take your shoes off. Shoes. I knew your father. Yeah? Do you know he's dead? Oh, sorry. How'd he go? - Stand. - He didn't complain. Yeah, that was his problem. Who said he had a problem? I just said he had a fucking problem. There's a man could've been anything. Are you trying to say that he was nothing? - Fuck. - I'm saying he worked at the airport. - He's clean. - Arm. Yeah, come on. What arm? What fucking arm? Show me your arm. Flip it. Makes me curious to see you in this neighborhood. He's clean. And if I can slander my own environment... ...it makes me sad, this regression. Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some fucking cop prick like Queenan... ...to pull you out of the staties and send you after me. I just can't know. I don't know what they do in that particular department, anyway. - Are you still a cop? - No! No! Swear on your mother's grave you're still not a cop? I am not a fucking cop! Are you gonna stop doing coke deals with your jerkoff fucking cousin? Yes. Yes, yes. All right, all right, all right. You're okay. You'll be all right. Get your hand taken care of. I'm sorry, but it was necessary. As for our problem with Providence... ...let's not cry over spilled guineas. Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar? Just kidding. How's your mother? She's on her way out. We all are. Act accordingly. Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered. Get in the car. I wanna show you something. - What's got you all hot and bothered? - Get in the car. You'll see. Do you trust him? Well, these days... ...who's reliable? His Uncle Jackie was. Yeah, but you can't trust a guy acts like he's got nothing to lose. I'm reliable. Arnold, you're one in a million. Ten. Ten million. What about your wife, Arnold? Well, I thought she was. She wasn't. Well, she got reliable. Don't you people ever shut the fuck up? Another county heard from. One too many. She got a big mouth. Answer this for me, will you? The principles of detection tell me these two gentlemen came from Providence. Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd appreciate it you get out of my crime scene. Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene, but knock yourself out. Thanks. I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having posttraumatic stress. Can I meet you for lunch? All right, see you then. Who's the lead detective? Good. He's a lox. Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas for the hit. He had nothing to do with it... ...and he'll say so. Look in his car, you'll find the gun that did it, registered, official. Providence. In the trunk or the glove compartment? Hey, you wanna see some dead guys? Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby on the 6:00 news. No wonder you get ahead. Have a seat, Bill. Do you know John Lennon? Yeah, sure, he was the president before Lincoln. Lennon said: ""I'm an artist. You give me a fucking tuba, I'll get you something out of it."" I tell you, Mr. Costello... ...I'd like to squeeze some fucking money out of it. Smart-mouth. Too bad. If you'll indulge me... Now what? Choir practice. Choir practice... The point I'm making with John Lennon is... ...a man could look at anything... ...and make something out of it. For instance... ...I look at you and I think: What could I use you for? Get rid of this. French. Put it downstairs. Here. Go ahead, thank you. Maybe we could work something out. - Good. - And send this to his wife. It was nice the way you asked the guy... ...which hand he jerked off with. I hope this don't shake Rita up. As I remember, she ain't that sentimental. That was quick. You think he's dead already? We have to do it by phone. I won't do it... ...if I have to wear a wire. No wires. Understand? - You don't know what this is like. - Microprocessors. - Micro what? - Microprocessors. We'll probably be at war with the Chinese in 20-odd years... ...and Costello is selling them military technology. Microprocessors, chips, computer parts. Anybody says anything about anything like that... ...you let us know. So who did the two guys from Providence? Jimmy Pappas. What happened to Jimmy Pappas? Jimmy had a rough month. Jimmy had a heart attack in jail... ...and then he got himself knifed at Boston City Hospital. I believe it's been in the papers. You seem quite happy with that result. It's a fucking result. Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits? Cui gives a shit? It's got a frigging bow on it. I think you are a cop, my son. - Where's your license? - What license? I don't see none. There's no such thing as a license, of course. But you, you definitely need to have fucking one. If you're not being run by us, you're being run by someone else. That means you're bringing undesirable elements... ...into Mr. Costello's area. I was going for my fucking cigarettes! Hey. That's Jimmy Bags. - He was rea... I don't know. - What the fuck you doing? I'm in the hole, I pay him two grand. There's no profit, I pay him two grand. Then make more money. This is America. You don't make money, you're a douche bag. Now what you gonna do? - Make more money. - That's the spirit! - Oh, fuck. - Don't worry about it. The guy don't need any fucking teeth anyway. It's a small surveillance subunit, but it's mine. I didn't take this job to fuck up or let anyone else fuck up. I handpicked this group. You're my A team. Now, our prim... Hi, Captain. This crazy fuck... - ... knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out. - So? - He was... - He was reaching for his cigarettes. You're gonna give me shit? It wasn't for no reason, Frank. He reached into his coat. I don't know if he's a bookie or what he's doing. Well, you do know what a bookie does, don't you? Yeah. Yeah, he pays you. Queenan's compartmentalizing everything in SIU... ...which is the right thing. I don't trust half the troopers out there anymore. Bottom line... ...we think we might have a problem. We think Costello's got a rat in the state police. - Really? - Yeah, really. Do we have direct access to Queenan's undercovers? No, no, not presently. But I'm working on that. Here, Bill, this is for you. From now on, call the bar, ask for Mikey. Just Mikey. You ask for Mikey because there is no Mikey. You wait. We'll call you. - You got that? - Yeah, I got that. - Sorry, I didn't hear you. - I got that. Good. Hi, Dad. I got promoted. All right. Excuse me for one second. You know... ...if your father were alive... ...and saw you here sitting with me... ...let's say he'd have a word with me about this. In fact, he'd kill seven guys just to cut my throat. And he could do it... ...which is maybe something you don't know about William Costigan Sr. - So he never...? I mean, never? - No. No, no. He kept his own counsel. He never wanted money. You can't do anything with a man like that. Your Uncle Jackie... ...he also would kill my entire fucking family if he saw me here with you. And I think about this. So what the fuck are we talking about here? Did you ever think about going back to school? School? With all due respect, Mr. Costello... ...school is out. Maybe someday you'll wake the fuck up. Good day, Fathers. - Mr. Costello. - Good morning, Francis, good morning. You recall our chat? Little boys... ...sucking on their peckers, et cetera and so forth... ""I am as God made me."" Was that your rationale? May I remind you, in this archdiocese, God don't run the bingo. May I remind you that pride comes before the fall. How's Sister Mary Theresa doing? We had a tasty relationship before she took her vows. Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers. Pay them. Get the old bombardier a drink on the house. - What do you got for me? - Uniform clipped him for suspended license. However, he's a subject of an open investigation... More than one. He's one of Costello's. We're getting a warrant. Can't get an address off him. He paged his lawyer but the lawyer hasn't called back yet. - Who's the lawyer? - Didn't know the name. Just a number. Beeper number. - And the guy didn't show up? - No. - And he beeped him? - Twice. Give me your phone. Turn that off. - What? - Turn the fucking camera off. Give it to me. He doesn't know what the fucking lawyer looks like. Whose briefcase is this? All right. - It's off? - You're good. Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons. - He can't do that. - He just did. - You my attorney? - What do you think? Have you made statements or phone calls... ...I need to be made aware of? I beeped you. The card they gave me. That's it. - That's it? - That's it. You need to call your mother... ...tell her you're not gonna be home for supper. Camera's off. It's off. Call your mother. Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid right now. I don't know where they're going, but they do. And so do you. So make the call. Lookit, fuckstick, you don't gotta trust me... ...just listen to what I'm saying to you. Mom, I'm not gonna make it home for supper. Sorry, yeah, I got held up. Yeah, no, you carry on without me. I'll talk to you later. Okay. Bye. Everybody out. Move. Thank you. So who are you? I think you need a different attorney, Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day. So when the fuck am I gonna get out? All right, run the last number he called. That's his house. I'll swear to the judge I surveilled him there... ...and abra-fucking-cadabra, we got a warrant. - Why did you use my phone? - Because you didn't go in there. The light's nice here in the morning. So do you wanna talk about last night? You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make too big a deal out of it. It's actually quite common. I gotta go to work. Do you lie? Why? Do you? No, I'm asking if you lie. Honesty is not synonymous with truth. Yeah, you lie. You lie. Is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally... ...or, what, just for the fuck of it? Well, I expect that some people do it to keep things on an even keel. So you had a parent who was a drunk. Did you? No. Let's keep it with you. Talk about how you feel. How I feel. How I feel. - Fuck. - Brian, stop it. No. Please. No. Ain't gonna hurt you. You sit there... ...with a mass murderer. A mass murderer. Your heart rate is jacked. And your hand... ...steady. That's one thing I figured out about myself in prison. My hand... ...does not shake. Ever. Wake the fuck up. There was a cop leaving when I came in. How did you know he was a cop? Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight, you know, air of scumbag entitlement. - Do you see cops? - That's part of what I do. I normally don't see cadets who've been kicked out of the academy. Oh, boy. You should get a better job, huh? Should I? So do they all come in here... ...and cry, your cops? Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure. Sometimes they cry, yeah. If they've had trouble at home, if they've had to use their weapons... Use their weapons? Let me tell you something. They signed up to use their weapons. Most of them, all right. But they watch enough TV... ...so they know they have to weep after they use their weapons. There is no one more full of shit than a cop. Except for a cop on TV. I looked at your file. I see that you have a record of assault. Yeah. So what was it like for you in jail? What, you wanna hear about the showers? Is that what you wanna hear about? Did something happen to you? No. - Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them. - Hey, you think you can pop somebody... ...and there's a special card to play? Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke... ...happens to work undercover for the Boston Police Department. I'm going nuts. I can't be someone else every day. It's been a year. I've had enough! Calm down. Most people do it every day. What's the big deal? - Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay? - Exactly. You're nobody. You signed the papers, remember? We're the only two people on this earth that even know you're a cop. How about we just erase your file, huh? How about we erase your file... ...and you're just another soldier for Costello... ...open to arrest for I don't know how many felonies. What do you say? How about I fucking kill you, huh? How about I fucking kill you! - That was a joke. Come on. - That wasn't a joke. You play a tough guy, doesn't mean you are one... - ... you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy! - Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it! - Fuck you, motherfucker! - Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order! For chrissake, be smart. If anybody's watching us now, how are we not supposed to arrest you? Come on, get in the car. Both of you, get in the car. When are you gonna take Costello? What's wrong with taking him on any one... ...of the million felonies that you've seen him do or I've seen him do? I mean, he murdered somebody, right? The guy fucking murders somebody and you don't fucking take him! What are you waiting for? Do you want him to chop me up and feed me to the poor? - That what you want? - That'd stick. Will you shut up? We are building a case and it takes time. You know that. Something's wrong. I'm telling you, something's wrong. Yeah, maybe. Look, we need you to keep your ears open, all right? No bullshit. I think Costello's got a spy inside the Special Investigation Unit. You serious? I'm afraid so. Have you heard anything like that? Jesus Christ. Hang tight for me, kid. Just a little while longer. We are this close: All right? What do you expect coming in here? - I have to come here. - I know you have to come here. But now that you're here... ...what do you want? You want the truth? Valium. If you lied, you would have an easier time getting what you wanted. - What's that say about what you do? - We should have a few more meetings... - ... before we even talk about prescriptions. - Look, I'm having panic attacks. Other night, I thought I was having a heart attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over. I haven't slept for fucking weeks. - Is that true? - Yeah, that's true. I said something fucking true. I want some fucking pills... ...and you're gonna close my file? - I didn't say I'd close your file. No, I... - I thought I was supposed to tell... - ... the truth here, if only fucking here. - You are! Yes. A guy comes in here against every instinct of privacy, of self-reliance that he has... ...and what do you do? What do you do? You send him off on the street to score smack? Is that what you do? You're fucking ridiculous. Two pills? Why don't you just give me a bottle of Scotch... ...and a handgun to blow my fucking head off? - Are we done with this psychiatry bullshit? - You can leave! What did I just put myself through? I'm out of here. And what if that was a legitimate threat? Think about it, fucking hotshot. Fuck. Why is the last patient of the day always the hardest one? You're tired and you don't give a shit. - It's not supernatural. - Listen. Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody that you have to see or they put you in jail. Okay? I mean, if you're in distress, I will help you. What's this? It's my card. And a prescription for lorazepam. Yeah? Is it enough to commit suicide? Maybe it is. All right? Okay? Have I done my job up to your goddamn standards? Because according to my standards, you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior. You know, and too damn bad if you don't like my initial clinical reaction. Thank you. I'm transferring you to another counselor. - Good. - Okay. So you wanna get a cup of coffee? Bring it in here, please. Would somebody bring it in? Come on in. Our target is a major transaction of microprocessors. Yes, those. I don't know what they are, you don't know what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash. Lots of cash is gonna change hands inside a building... ...that we have under AV surveillance close-by. I know this location is not the best, but we had very little time to set up. - You guys know anything about this? - No. Sullivan's team will ID the bad guys and listen in on the phones. Our unit will not take action. I repeat, not take action, until a man that Captain Queenan has inside... ...verifies the transaction. Are we clear? Anybody? Any questions? No? This is who we're after. We've been after this cocksucker for a long time, and tonight... ...we are going to get him. Let's go to work. All right, you guys find out what we're doing and get on it. Sorry to get you last-minute, but things leak. This lead came from Queenan's undercover guy. I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself. - Hi, Dad? - Yes. Yeah, something big came up at work. - I'm not gonna be home for supper. - Too bad. Your mother worked all goddamn day. We'll just have to sit down without you and your friends. Oh, no, my friends are still coming. So we'll just... I'll just see you for lunch instead tomorrow. Your mother will be proud. All right, thanks, Pop. Bye. The readiness is all. You know the players. Call the game. Thank you. - You ready? - Is your highness... ...gonna drop me off at confession before work, or fuck me, or what? What have you got to confess to that anointed pederast? A confessional seal, these days... ...I'm not so sure. He'll operate the cameras. You ID the guys and log them. All cellphone signals are under surveillance... ...through the courtesy of our federal friends over there. Patriot Act, Patriot Act. I love it, I love it, I love it. Keep an eye on this one. All right, here we go. There's Costello. Mr. French. There's Fitzy, Delahunt... ...and the new guy, Billy Costigan. Time is 10:46. All right, turn off your cellphones. Fitzy's got the chicken. Check your weapons. - We have a blind spot. - Why do we have a blind spot? We had two hours' notice. Two hours. - Fuck you think this is, NASA? - It never crossed my mind. - Have you got a camera in the back? - What back? - How you going, Robert? - Good, Mr. Costello. I wanna tell you, at least two of these gents have machine guns. He's from the Chinese government. He's scared shitless. Government man. Scared. I'm concerned about a Chinaman who thinks it's wise... ...to come to a business transaction... ...with automatic weapons. For his own good, tell Bruce Lee and the Karate Kids... ...none of us are carrying automatic weapons. Because here, in this country... ...it don't add inches to your dick. You get a life sentence for it. If we had some Homeland Security money like some douche bags I could mention... - Any calls? - They turned off their cellphones. Search randomly for calls made from the area. Eight hundred and seven phones are live in this area. Then narrow the area. What you see there for service is what you're gonna get. Why did they turn their phones off? - Wait. There's still one phone up. - Where? The buyers are there. You know, direct contact with your guys would have its advantages. Not to my guy. This is unbelievable. Who put the cameras in this place? Oh, who the fuck are you? I'm the guy who does his job. You must be the other guy. If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan any time in this century... ...they'd better shape up and show me million dollars. What we generally do, in this country... ...is one guy... ...brings the items... ...and the other guy... ...pays him. No ""tickee""... ...no laundry. Go ahead, Fitz. Cars are moving, but did you see anybody come out? Please tell me those cars aren't empty. I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty! They didn't figure we had a navy. Did you put a camera in the back? Can I talk to you for a second, please? You stupid fucking hard-on! You fucked this whole thing up! What the fuck did you do, you cocksucker? Let go of me! I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off and shove it up your fucking ass! Why don't we meet? Let me buy you an ice cream. I'm getting on a plane unless you put Queenan on. Queenan had a funeral to go to. This is my shift. Calm down. Why shouldn't I get on a fucking plane, huh? Meet up? You actually want me dead? Look, there is a rat in your unit. That is a fact, all right? - Where's Queenan? - He's not here. They knew you had cameras in the building. They knew everything. There is a leak from the inside. It's real. Man, smoke him out. Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who- Didn't-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy? Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have a sealed wiretap warrant... ...for Costello's apartment. Don't tell anyone in our division, but tell SIU. Flush it down the pipe, see if it comes out on my end. That's what we do first. Narrow it down. - Where the fuck is Queenan, huh? - He's not here. You wanna meet up or you got something real, call me back. ...changing your life radically. Change anything. Right? Change everything. - Right? - Yeah. How long you been with this guy? - My boyfriend? - Yeah. - Four months. Almost four months. - Four months. Do you love him? It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah. It's very serious. Is he a headcase like me? I'm just curious. No more than I am. I know that it's a serious relationship. I know there are ups and downs. Right? People have doubts and problems. Well, not problems, but doubts. What would you do if he was standing right there and he saw us? I would lie. Yeah, I would lie. You know, to keep things on an even keel, right? Right? We talked about that. - Morning. - Good morning. Want a French doughnut? Yeah. - Hey, can I lookit? - Yeah. Sure. - All right, we're not having this out. - What? You don't see any pictures of where I came from. Look, I respect who you are... ...just, you know, not in the living room. We might have company. - Company? - Yeah, company. - Hey, now, why do you work for the state? - Why not? You do. No, what you do. The degrees and all, everything you got. You're hot shit. Yeah? So why do you make as much as a guidance counselor? Because I believe in public service. So now you're gonna fuck with me? So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh? - No, don't start with me. Don't... - Hey. Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it! - The phone. - Forget the phone. Get it. Answer it. Answer it. This is your first phone call in the new house. You live here now. You're a resident. Mayor Sullivan's office. Put Colin on the phone right now. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. What? I think it's a guy with... - It's like a cancer guy. - Hello. What the fuck is it with you and your phone, huh? Something for work. Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing. It went dead. I don't know, I get... Was that that shrink cunt that answered the phone? Remember I told you that we were... She was gonna move in? - Yeah. - She moved in. - You better get organized, quick. - Last time I checked, I tipped you off... ...and you're not in jail. - Are you listening to me? - Yeah. Do you like Little Miss Thing sucking on your cock? Yes. Yes, I do. So earn it. I'm getting the feeling... ...we got a cop in my crew. Yeah, I know, I'm kind of getting that feeling too. He's one of yours. Inside. Have you seen anything? I got no access to Queenan's undercover files. He and Dignam run the snitches. - Doing my best. - Your best? What do you think we're in, the fucking haberdashery business? Look, Frank, if you don't relax... If you don't relax, I can't relax. All right? Now, what I need you to do... ...get me information on the people with you last night. Your crew. Get me social-security numbers, get me... Get you? Give you? Who the fuck do you work for? All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank. All right. I'm sorry. If you could, please. What I need are SS numbers, DOBs... ...just all the pedigree information so I can run it on my end and we can ID the prick. If you can get me that information... ...I can... We're gonna handle it. I can handle it. Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants. I'll get you the records and whatnot. But listen to me, son. Don't disappoint me on this... ...or some other guy will be putting their fat cock... ...up Little Miss Freud's ass. How are you, Francis? - My mother called me Francis. - I know she did. And your father called you the tumor. And what did your father call you, Charlie? Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasn't around. You have a boss that has a laryngectomy? No, no, no. That was a guy who works for me. You're lying to me. Not exactly. What did you do with the real microprocessors, Frank? Microprocessors. Oh, yeah. I heard the story. You arrested some Chinese government guys... ...at the border carrying some light sockets or something. I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk off of your face. Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me? There are certain parts of my job that I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about. And I cannot allow you to jeopardize an ongoing investigation... ...or your life. No, really, there are things you don't even wanna know about. Okay, then just say that. All right, I will. Oh, that's the movers. Yeah, you still wanna stay? - Yes. - Yeah? Come on, I'm coming! It's the worst timing. I'm gonna get you. If you could've, you would've. But I guess you like to go at your own pace. Excuse me. Got a date with some angels. Frankie. Frankie! Your mother forgives me. You take off an armored car at the mall. What the fuck, you pay guineas in Providence? - Fucking now I do! - What the fuck do you do? I gotta pay Costello for him to trade me to the FBI? Because that's what he does. FBI? What the fuck you talking about, FBI? My God, is that French out there? What the fuck did you just say about the FBI? Forget what I said. I'm fucking high. Whatever may be going on in that very fucking poor... ...very limited brain of yours, I am not gonna hurt you, all right? - Just tell me what you fucking said. - Forget it. I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high. I'd never say what you thought I said. Fuck! Now, what the fuck did you just fucking say? Why do you think he never gets busted? Costello's a protected FBI informant. He'll trade you out. I thought I was supposed to go into shock. I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts! It fucking hurts! Hey. It's me. - What are you doing here? - Come here. Costello's giving people up to the FBI. - The FBI? - He is giving information to the FBI. He's a protected fucking informant. I mean, aren't they always trying to make it a federal case and it never gets made? Go around the back. I'll open the door. Go on. - Here's some ice water. - Oh, thanks. Thanks. That's my son, Patrick. - Goes to Notre Dame. - Oh, yeah? My wife's asleep but she left some supper out. You want something to eat? No. No, thanks. Yeah, come on, man. You have some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen. Come on. You want some coke? There it is. Don't move till you're numb. Come on. Get inside. Boss wants your real name... ...your social and license number, your bank account numbers. I don't have a bank account. - I'm a cash business myself. - What's he doing, setting up IRAs? Just fill the fucking paper in. Your real name and all your account numbers. Then we wait here. - You're shitting me. - No, I ain't. Put the forms in there. I don't know if this is how you spell ""citizens."" But fuck it, you know? No, no, no. Come here. What, are you fucking retarded or something? That ain't fucking right. Are you kidding me? Look at this. Look. ""Citizens."" Look. Billy, he said to stay here. Yeah. I'm not sitting here without a tetanus shot. Where the fuck are you going? I'm not staying, all right? You can tell him I said that. - Hey. - Hi. - It's pouring out there. - Yeah. Look... - ... if this is inappropriate, I... - No. No, it's not inappropriate. You're not a patient. So you moving out or you moving in? I've still got three weeks left on the lease. That's me. Yeah, I know. - Hedging your bets? - No. No. You have to choose. - You have to make a... - A decision. A decision. And, you know, you have to stick by what you choose. - You have to... - Move in with your boyfriend? Yes. Otherwise it's... Oh, I know, I know. I know. I have to say your vulnerability is really freaking me out right now. Is it real? I think so. You don't have any cats. No. I like that. I don't get it. We are all convinced that Costello has at least... ...one mole inside the Special Investigations Unit. You will investigate everybody and anybody. Well, that's not exactly a dream job for a cop. We looked at all possible candidates. You have an immaculate record. Some people don't trust a guy with an immaculate record. I do. I have an immaculate record. How is your wedding coming along? Great. Great. She's a doctor. - That's outstanding. - Yeah. Marriage is an important part of getting ahead. Lets people know you're not a homo. Married guy is more stable. People see the ring, think at least someone can stand him. Ladies see the ring, they know you must have some cash and your cock must work. Yeah, it's working. Overtime. - I'm glad to hear that. - Thank you. Be dirty, be dirty. Yeah... Frank. The fuck is wrong with you? - See anything you like, Col? - I almost fucking shot you. - You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you? - Sit down. I hope you're not turning into one of them sob sisters wants to get caught. You're not cracking up, are you? - I don't crack up. - Pick a place like this... ...where any cop could see you. Jesus. If this is such a fucking bad idea why'd you show up? I own the place. Why am I not fucking surprised? - All right, lookit, I gotta tell you... - You're getting reassigned. I know. How the fuck do you know that? - Where'd they put you? - Hey, Frank. I gotta find myself. You're telling me, sonny boy. I gotta find the guy you got in the department. With everybody looking up their own ass and you looking for yourself... ...I put my money on nobody finds nothing. I know, but, Frank, lookit. For me, you gotta lay low. - Right now. - Collie... ...laying low is not what I do. All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank. Fucking perfect. What good am I to you if you don't listen to me? What good am I if you don't listen? Queenan is compartmentalizing. He's splitting everything up. He's fucking smart. You know this. I can get the rat. You just gotta let me do it my way, Frank. Okay. But Colin, I hope I won't have to remind you... ...that if you don't find that cheese-eating rat bastard in your department... ...most likely, it won't be me who suffers for it. Now, why would you have to remind me of that? Would I be any good at what I do if I didn't fucking already know that? Frank, you gotta trust me. All right? Just trust me, Frank. Hey, it fucking involves lying and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right? Right? Maybe because it's always been so easy... ...for me to get cunt that I never understood jerking off in a theater. Christ. Who knows what's easy? Colin, I know you'll take care of business. Shit! Fuck. Hey, how you doing? Hi, Darlene, hi. - That's it for me. - Yeah, see you. Have a good one. I smell a rat. Jesus Christ. You got a girlfriend? No. No, no. Why, what does that matter? It depends. I'm sure by now you know... ...I got an informer in my outfit. Cop. Staties, Boston Police Department, I'm not sure. Jesus Christ. Are you sure it's not the FBI? It ain't the FBI. Ex-wife. Old girlfriend. Or stupid. That is what brings you down in this business. Stupid, huh? Well, I guess that leaves me out. You know, past days, situation like this, I kill everybody. Everybody who works for me. Right. You know, Frank... ...I look around at your other guys... I mean, they're all murderers, right? Right? And I think, ""Could I do murder?"" And all I can answer myself is: ""What's the difference?"" Give them up to the Almighty. You see, that's my point, you know? You accuse me once, I put up with it. You accuse me twice... ...I quit. You pressure me to fear for my life and I will put a fucking bullet in your head... ...as if you were anybody else. Okay? You got something you wanna ask me? Look, you're years old, Frank. I'm just saying, okay? One of your guys is gonna pop you. - One of your guys is gonna pop you. - Yeah, yeah. As for running drugs, what the fuck are you doing? You don't need the money or the pain in the ass. And they will catch you. I haven't needed the money... ...since I took Archie's milk money in the third grade. Tell you the truth, I don't need pussy anymore, either. But I like it. Point I'm making here is, Bill... ...I got this rat... ...this gnawing, cheese-eating, fucking rat... ...and it brings up questions. You know. See, Bill, like, you're the new guy. Girlfriend... Why don't you stay in the bar that night I got your numbers? Social-security numbers. - Yeah. - Everybody's fucking numbers. Is there something that you just wanna go ahead and ask me? Because I'll give you the fucking answer, all right? Frank, look at me. Look at me. I'm not the fucking rat. Okay? I'm not the fucking rat. Start with you agree there is a rat. You said there is one, all right? I base most of what I do on the idea that you're pretty good at what you do. Sure. Sure, Will. You, William. What would you do? Frank, how many of these guys... ...have been with you long enough to be disgruntled? Think about it. You don't pay much, you know. It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise. The question is, and this is the only question... ...who thinks that they can do what you do better than you? The only one who could do what I do is me. Lot of people had to die for me to be me. You wanna be me? I probably could be you. Yeah. Yeah, I know that much. But I don't wanna be you, Frank. I don't wanna be you. ""Heavy lies the crown"" sort of thing. Yeah. - Francis. - I'm out of here. You'll set the alarm... - Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas. - All right. Good night. You know what I like about restaurants? The fucking food? I don't know. What? You learn a lot watching things eat. There's a boat coming up Gloucester. French will give you all the details. Don't forget. Eat something, for Christ's sake. In the future, I tell you to do a thing, you fucking do it. You got that? I got it. Okay? Excuse me... - ... French, I forgot my... - Okay, Francis. ...cigarette. Eat something. Problem? Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks like you, okay? I don't like them. The day you wouldn't take a promotion, let me know. If you'd taken care of this I wouldn't be here. - Fuck yourself, you piece of shit. - I need the identity of your undercovers. Blow me. Not literally. Unfortunately, there's no promotion involved for you. Fucking prick. - Hi, captain. - Look who's here. The prom queen. - They are not happy with me. - What do you expect? Everybody knows you've been assigned here to find Costello's rat. They want to find the leak as much as you do. Like I said, two days ago, my guy damn near found out who Costello's rat is. - But he lost him in the streets. - Really? - Well, did he get a look at the guy? - No. I mean, nothing? Like, I mean, anything that could help us. No. So you got any advice for me? Just, I mean, generally. Costello can't do much business without coordinating with his source... ...who is here in SIU. Follow Costello. You'll find his rat. You're gonna be looking at my people... ...going through their bank statements, their phone calls and medical records. Don't be surprised if they don't buy you a beer or invite you into their homes. Let me get you a coffee. If I wasn't with the Massachusetts State Police... ...if I did it full-time, law school... ...I'd be through it in a year. If I wasn't a trooper. But another city. I was thinking that. Another city. Another city, huh? Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate. I want you to know, you don't got to stay. If we're not gonna make it... ...it's gotta be you that gets out, because I'm not capable. I'm fucking Irish. I'll deal with something being wrong for the rest of my life. It might not be a bad idea, you know, another city. - Of course I know how to spot a cop. - How's that? If he's not paying attention to us, he's a cop. Lookit. You see that guy over there? Right over there. Yeah. Not paying attention to us. He's a cop. - Okay. - You get it now, do you? - What about this guy? - Cop. Hey, how you doing? What kind of dog is that? She ignored us so she must be a cop. She's probably the fucking police commissioner. You can get out of here. I'm using a new crew tonight. New guys. - I thought I was on for this. - I changed my mind. Take the night off. Francis, we're ready for the sushi bar. - Jimmy, bring a mop. - Out the back. There's guys who answer the questions right... - ... and there's guys that don't. - And a pail. You're a cop. What? You ignored us, you're a cop. We're guessing who cops are. You know, most good-looking women are cops. Well, I'm going home, all right? He's playing with his new guys. - See you later, all right? - See you later. He's moving something with all new guys. A whole new crew. No, no, I can't tell you what or where. It's probably disinformation. Just keep following him, all right? Listen, I need to see you today. - Tomorrow. - No, no, no. Today. - You heard nothing about drugs? - No. Nothing about new guys? Nothing about Gloucester? Not a thing. And I would have. That information would have come to me. It ain't Bill. No way, he says. Follow Costello. You'll find his rat. Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan. I want constant surveillance on Captain Queenan, starting right now. Good. Thank you. Can I ask a question, sarge? Why the fuck are we following Captain Queenan? To find out about the good Catholic life? I have to follow every lead, however unlikely... ...however fucking painful it might be to your delicate fucking sensibilities. Who told you I had delicate sensibilities? - I just don't like it. Don't feel right. - I have reason to believe... ...that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat. So just follow him and don't get made. Sarge, we got the target coming out. Hey. Where are you? Look down the car. - You got me? - Yeah, I gotcha. Is there a reason you would have a tail? No. - Because I think... - Billy, I don't have a tail. Get off at the next stop, all right? South Station. You wait there minutes. South Station. Wait minutes. He just went into a building down the waterfront. Wash. You got that? Wash. Yeah, he went up to the top floor. Building's empty. No tenants here. He's got dope coming in. I don't know where. He... He's getting spooky, captain. - What? - I just saw him. He had blood on his hands. He's lost his fucking mind. I don't know what we're doing here, boys. He's not including his regular guys. But I'll tell you something. Sooner or later he's gonna find out who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me. - I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me! - All right! I think we got him. I think Queenan's meeting with him right now. All right, all right. Listen to me. I'm really sorry for your trouble. I swear to God I am. I'll get you out of this. I can't do it overnight but I'll get you out. Yeah? Hey, get the van. We're moving. Heavy work. - What about the FBI? - They're compromised. - They're what? - They're fucked. - Yeah. - Where are you? We've been trying to reach you. We found the rat. Listen, we're gonna take him out. Lookit: The address is Washington Street. You got it? All right, we'll see you there. - What? - You were followed. - By who? - By Costello's people. - Impossible. - One of the cops... ...he's got on the inside tipped him. Come on. Come on. Come on! What the fuck is going on? Fucking shit. Looks like Queenan's meeting with all of them. Yeah, he must be our guy. Sarge, we gotta get him out of here. Those guys aren't fucking around. Ah, Christ, it's too late. Let's go back up. - Shit! - You got to get out of here! - Take the fire escape. - What about you? I'll be fine. But if you get made I can't protect you. Now, go! - One of you mugs got a light? - Where's your boy? - He's studying law at Notre Dame. - Where's your fucking boy? - Hey! Hey! - Goddamn motherfucker! - Fucking kill you! - Where's your fucking boy? What the fuck was that? Did you fucking see that? Sarge, something just came off the building. What the fuck? Fuck. What do you mean, off the building? - Something came off the fucking roof. - It's a fucking body. We can't get a visual. Want us to get out? We gotta get on foot if you want me to get up on this thing. - Where were you? - What happened? You're fucking late! Get in the van! What do you mean, off the roof? What's going on? I came to meet you. - What the fuck...? - Get in the van! I got four armed men right out front. You want us to pursue? No, do not pursue. Stay in the car. - Fuck. No fucking pursuit. - I need information. What came off the roof? - No pursuit. - That's bullshit. Fuck this. Fitzy! Get in the van! Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move! All right. I got him. 32X to CP. We're being fired upon! An officer is down. I repeat, an officer is down. A trooper's been shot! Send some back... So do you know why Queenan went into that building? - No. - Well, a better question... ...is why the fuck were your guys following him? I told Internal Investigations to follow Captain Queenan. - Why? - That's Internal Investigations' business. Fucking piece of shit! - All right. - Hey, hey! - Fucking bitch! - Let him go! Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain anything to anybody! I can fucking investigate anybody I want to! - Come on! - I don't give a fuck what you think! I got reason to believe that Queenan got killed by his fucking undercover. That's a fucking lie. He has fucking information in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan. I need access to those files. I forgot the password but if you come with me I'll give it to you. - That's a fucking lie. - Nobody calls me a liar! Shut up! Work with the tech guys to unlock those files. - Dignam, take a leave of absence. - Take a leave of what? Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now. I don't care. I'd rather hand in my papers first. World needs plenty of bartenders. Two weeks with pay. Good. - Piece of shit. - Fuck off. - I need those codes. - No. You want those codes. So where the fuck were you? Well, boss told me to go home. Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. But you weren't at fucking home. So where the fuck were you? I was at the grocery store with no signal, all right? When I got the signal, I got the call. What the fuck do you want from me? Was I there or was I not there? Billy. Billy. Yeah? Yeah? You know what I thought today? What's that? Who didn't show up today is the rat. Yeah? - So? - And you never been late in your life. When I called you... ...I made a mistake. I gave you the wrong address... ...but you showed up at the right one... ...didn't you? Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh? Tell me why. That cop was tough. We were excessive with the cop. He's dead. I'm going home. - Your guys should not have done that. - One of us had to die. With me it tends to be the other guy. But Queenan. Now I got no access. You killed the guy who had the info. Dignam's gone. Forget about him. - He resigned. - I don't give a fuck about Dignam. He put in his papers, Frank. - He left. I don't know where he is. - Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie. That Irish pissant... ...he's so hot for me, we give him a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it. Let's give him a whiff. - I will. - Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Sweetheart. You're giving me a hard-on. Are you sure it's me? Not all that talk about whiffing and crawling up asses? Watch your fucking mouth. No. You watch it. Let me straighten you out. I tried to call you a few times. I know. Listen, I can't be a friend to you. I'm sorry. Yeah... ...I know. Yeah. You called this number on a dead guy's phone. Who are you? So it is you. Well, thank God you're all right. We were very worried. Who are you? This is Sergeant Sullivan. I'm taking over Queenan's unit. Let me talk to Dignam to confirm it. Staff Sergeant Dignam... ...is on a leave of absence. He's very upset. We're all very upset. I think the best thing would be for you to come in. We need you to come in. Can you come in? We'll meet... Police confirm the body of the man found dead... ...in the Fenway marshes yesterday... ...is that of Timothy Delahunt, an undercover policeman for... ...the city of Boston. This was the scene yesterday... ...when Delahunt's body was found in the marshes near the Fenway. As for who did this or why... ...that's something police are working on right now. - I don't believe it. - What can't you believe? I spent all fucking night dragging the poor bastard in there. Tell me how they found him so fast. Somebody walking a fucking dog in three feet of mud? What kind of fucking size of dog is that? Must have been a big fucking dog, man. I spent all fucking night doing it, man. I'm embarrassed. I still don't believe he was a cop. I don't believe it. The cops are saying he's a cop... ...so I won't look for the cop. Are you soft, Fitz? When I tell you to dump a body in the marsh... ...you dump him in the marsh. Not where some guy from John Hancock goes every Thursday... ...to get a fucking blowjob! Don't laugh! This ain't reality TV! Proceed. - What? - Yeah. You got a tail. Two cars. Not very subtle. They're not gonna be subtle from now on. That's what I've been trying to say. So get rid of them. There's no need for you to go yourself, Frank. Get rid of the fucking tail! All right. Fucking rats. It's wearing me thin. Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats. Stop, stop. Pull them off Costello. There's no need to surveil him. - What are you saying? - I got it from an undercover. He knows he's being followed. So let the UC take him in. - Undercover? - Queenan's guy. He called when he found out Queenan died. I'm running him. - You give him to me. - No, I can give you Costello's destination. - You know where he's going? - Yes. And what he's doing. Get rid of the tail, get Special Ops on standby. - We'll take this prick tonight. - Let's go. Now. All units fall back. All units fall back. It's the warehouse he owns over on Sheffield. He's gotta have a container or a truck or something there. Go. Load it. Frank, how do you know you don't have a tail, huh? Were you not in the fucking car? Yeah, what if they took one off and they put another one on? Load. Go, go! Come on, what are you waiting for? Frank wants me to check the back. You go ahead. - Watch your fucking back. - Move out! Go on! Cocksuckers. Motherfucking shit! Motherfucking...! Back the fuck up! They fucking shot me. Get down! Come on, fucking bastards! Fuck it. How the fuck did this happen? You're an FBI informant? Are you fucking kidding me? Grow up. Of course I talk to the FBI. Do they know who I am? I never gave up anybody who wasn't going down anyway. Nobody knows nothing. Frank. Frank. Frank. Do they know about me? I know about you, Collie. You know I'd never give you up. - You're like a... - What? Like a son? To you? Is that what this is about? All that murdering and fucking, and no sons. Fucking rat prick! Frank? Yeah? Who's this? Gwen? Where the hell's Frank? Frank got shot. Gwen, we lost Frank. I got him! I got Costello here! Hey, good job, sarge. No, it's... For you. - Thank you. - No. Thank you. He's been waiting here a long time for you. How'd you get him without the files? Caller ID on Queenan's phone. You know that guy? Yeah. We were classmates in the academy together. Good to see you, trooper. - Yeah. - Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone. - Yeah. - So. Now, how long were you undercover? Long time. - Long fucking time. - Yeah. Yeah. Well, I can't even tell you the debt... I just want you to know I'll be recommending you for the Medal of Merit. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. That's kind of like a gold star around here, huh? It's the highest honor we got. Look, I just want my identity back, all right? - That's all. - All right. - I understand. You wanna be a cop again. - No, no. Being a cop's not an identity. I want my identity back. Check your computer. Go on. You'll have to excuse my behavior. My only contact in the last six months has been a police shrink. How's that working for you? Is it helpful? What are you gonna do about Costello's rat in this building? - I'm gonna find the prick. - Yeah. I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna arrest him. - Good. - Anything you can do to help me... You know, I mean, did Frank ever mention a name...? You know, anything. Someone he was in contact with. Anything you can give me. I'm all done being a cop, all right? I just want my money and I wanna go home. All right. That'll be the best thing for everybody. Fair enough. I just, I can't get into your file unless I have your password. It's my name. William Costigan Jr. They gave it to me in case I had to explain myself to someone like you. It's your name. All right. Fucking unreal, that... Well, makes a lot of sense. Listen, Bill, I gotta run this in the other room. This computer's getting all frigging blooey on me. Give me two minutes. I'll have you out of here in no time. All right, everything checks out, so let's get you paid. I know. I know. I'm not... I'm not here for that, okay? I'm not. Listen. I've gotta give you something. Something I need you to keep. For me. Okay? - What is it? - This is for you to hold. Only you. You open this if something happens to me or if I call you and I tell you to open it. You're the only person I can trust, all right? Please. - All right. - Look, I'm sorry to even... I'm sorry to even show up here like this, you know? I... There's just no one else I could give it to. There's no one else. - I'm really sorry. - I... You know, I have... - I... - Whatever you have to say... ...think about it real hard, all right? If you still wanna tell me, you tell me in two weeks, okay? I was dreaming I was dead. Death is hard. Life is much easier. - What's this? - Open it. - Really? - Yeah. Really? Yeah. And they say that this little speck... ...is a penis. It's a boy. Yeah, well, one usually follows the other. Can you still...? I hope I won't have to remind you... ...that if you don't find this cheese-eating rat bastard in your department... ...you can assume it won't be me who pays for it. Now, why would you have to remind me of that? Would I...? Would I be any good at what I do if I didn't fucking already know that? Frank, you gotta trust me. I can get the rat. You just gotta let me do it my way, Frank. Just let me do it. Let me do what I do. Hey, it fucking involves lying and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right? What? What? - We got a cop in my crew. - Yeah, I know. - I'm kind of getting that feeling too. - He's one of yours. Inside. - You seen anything? - Frank. I got no access to Queenan's undercover files. He and Dignam run the snitches. - I'm doing my... - You know what, I thought I was the liar. Hey, I can explain that! Costello recorded everything. He put all the tapes in a box and kept them with his lawyer. That was his insurance. His lawyer came to me. Imagine that, you rat fuck. Costello trusted me more than anyone. Sound quality good enough? Because I was a little worried. - What do you want? - I told you I want my identity back... ...you two-faced faggot. - All right, where are you? - Three o'clock. Where Queenan died. You keep your cell on. Open the door. Open... Didn't we already talk about this? This is my job. - Freeze! Get your fucking hands up! - Hey! Put the fucking gun down! Put the gun down, all right? I came here to talk some sense into you. - Hands! - Just act professional. - I can get you your money. - What did you say? - I can get you your money. - You didn't come here to talk, all right? - You came here to get arrested. - You got fucking tapes? Of what? Costello was my informant. I was a rat? Fuck you! Prove it. He was working for me. He was my informant. Shut your fucking mouth. Come on, get up! What is this, a citizen's arrest? Blow me, all right? Only one of us is a cop here, Bill. You understand that, Bill? - No one knows you. - Shut the fuck up! I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts State Police. Who the fuck are you? - I erased you! - You erased me, huh? Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein. Watch what happens. This bullet would go right through your fucking head! - Watch what happens! - What, so you can get the parade, huh? The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you! Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you! - That's the stupidest thing you could do. - Shut the fuck up! I could give a fuck if the charges don't stick. I'm still fucking arresting you. Get up. Drop your weapon and step away from Sergeant Sullivan. I called you. You specifically. Look: You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot. I told you to meet me downstairs. Put your weapon on the deck and step away from Sergeant Sullivan! Where's Dignam? I told you to bring Dignam! Shoot this motherfucker! Would you fucking shoot! - Drop your weapon. We'll discuss it. - Look, he's Costello's rat, all right? I got boxes of tapes! Evidence! Other documents proving it! Maybe you do. But right now I need you to drop the weapon! I have evidence cold-linking this prick to Costello, all right? - Would you shoot this fucking prick! - You know who I am. - You know who I am. - Shoot this fucking prick. I'm taking him downstairs now. You know who I am. Shut up. I can't wait to see you explain this to a Suffolk County jury... ...you fucking cocksucker. This is gonna be fucking fun. Just fucking kill me. Just fucking kill me. I am killing you. Did you think you were the only one he had on the inside? Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI. It's you and me now, you understand? We gotta take care of each other, you understand? Give me that. Right. Slow. March. I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan... ...at which time he drew down on me, and I was able to squeeze off one shot... ...and strike him in the head. At that time I immediately checked the vitals... ...on both Troopers Brown and Costigan... ...and discovered that they had expired. I just wanna go on record. I'm recommending William Costigan for the Medal of Merit. - Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord. - Ready? - And let perpetual light shine upon him. - Fold. May he rest in peace. Amen. May his soul and the souls... ...of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen. Detail. Half left. Face. Prepare to fire. Fire. Prepare to fire. Fire. Prepare to fire. Fire. Detail. Half right. Face. I'll catch up with you guys. What about the baby? Hi, pup. Okay."
60,2008,Space Chimps,American,"Ham III, grandson of the first chimpanzee in space, is a cannonball at his circus, which his grandfather's friend Houston criticizes. Meanwhile, an unmanned NASA space probe called the Infinity is dragged into an intergalactic wormhole and crash-lands on an Earth-like planet on the other side of the galaxy. Zartog, an evil-minded inhabitant, accidentally discovers how to take manual control of the on-board machinery and uses it to enslave the population.
Faced with the loss of the probe and probable loss of their budget, the scientists have to find a way to regain contact with the probe, to help retrieve the wayward craft. Technical genius chimp Comet gets the scientists to pick them as astronauts to explore the planet and get the probe back, with the help of the fearless Lt. Luna, and their bombastic commander, Titan. The Senator likes the idea, but wants something extra special to grab the attention of the media, and picks Ham. Ham is uninterested in the mission, but he is launched into space despite his best efforts to escape the scientist's training facility.
The three chimps enter the wormhole, where Titan and Luna pass out from the pressure, leaving Ham with the task of getting the ship out and landing it. This is done, and Ham and Luna explore the planet, during which their ship, along with Titan, is taken by a group of aliens sent by Zartog. Ham and Luna begin their journey to Zartog's palace, and on the way they meet one of the inhabitants, known to them as Kilowatt. Kilowatt offers to lead them to the palace, but soon after they encounter a flesh eating monster in a cave. The monster blocks the exit, but Kilowatt distracts it, sacrificing herself so Ham and Luna can escape.
The two chimps finally reach the palace, where they discover that Titan has been teaching Zartog some of the probe's features. They rescue him and are able to board their ship, but just as they are about to leave, Ham glances outside and sees Zartog torturing some of the other aliens. He then tells Titan and Luna that they indirectly sent the probe there, and that they owe it to Kilowatt to help save the planet. The three of them exit the ship, which blasts off set to autopilot, but as they are trying to think of a plan, Zartog attacks them with the probe. Just as they are about to get destroyed, Titan tricks Zartog into triggering an ejection mechanism in the probe, which in turn leads to his defeat.
The chimps then discover that Kilowatt has survived, and they are able to make contact with Comet and Houston back on Earth through a walkie-talkie. Houston reminds them that if they can redesign the probe, then they can use it to get back to Earth. They manage to do this with help from the planet's inhabitants and they use an erupting volcano to get the thrust they need to escape the planet's gravity. They go into space, and just as they are about to re-enter the wormhole, Titan hands the controls over to Ham, since Ham is the only one who can withstand the pressure, and thus, the only one who can pilot the ship home. Titan and Luna once again pass out. Ham is unsure if he is up to the task until he has a mental conversation with his grandfather, who tells him to believe in himself and to just do things his (Ham's) way.
Ham manages to manoeuver the ship back to Earth and land it with Luna's help, and the Senator, under pressure from the press, decides to dramatically increase the space program's funding. The film ends with a celebration being held for the chimps' return.",4.5,tt0482603," Since the dawn of time, space flight has been a dream. The rocket made it a reality. But before man braved that first giant step... the brave stepped into the rocket... and the brave were chimps. Ham was the first American to boldly go... where no man, or chimp, had gone before. And tonight his brave legacy lives on. Introducing Ham the Third... Ham's one and only grandson. Thank you. Thank you. No autographs. No flash photos. - Okay, fine. Photos. I'll sign that later. Ladies and gentlemen, strap yourselves in as we embark on a mission to the stars! Space, stars, blah, blah, blah. - Enough with the lecture. Let's get to the action. - Aim high, buckle up. Chin down, opposable thumbs in. When you gonna stop worrying about me, Houston? Space is in my veins. - And between your ears. - It's showtime! Here we go! Come on! Let's make some noise! Let's tear the roof off of this tent. We're gonna go bananas! Hup! Hey! Hoop! Prepare to be amaze-ified. - Let's light this candle. - Say it with me. - T-minus three- - Three, two, one! Blast off! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Ladies. And back again. I'm so excited. I just can't hide it! Keep your eye on the landing pad. No monkey business. Stay on target, hotshot. Big finale comin' up. Hoo-hoo! And a flipsy... and a dipsy and a do. Whoo-hoo! Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Whoa! - Oh, Lord. - Whoa! Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Whoa! This is not good! Oh! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! He's always showboatin'. Ta-da! It's all good, folks! That's why I put the helmet on the monkey. The Infinity probe successfully advancing past lunar orbit. Status: Unmanned and remote-controlled. Mission: Search for life. Detecting unidentified space anomaly. Warning. System malfunction. System malfunction. - It's so pretty! - Ha! Come here, little fluttereye. - Oh, no! - Zartog! Can't you brats read? Keep away from my house! - Oy. - Hmm. You monster! If I could catch you punks, I'd dunk you in the Freznar too! No wonder why everyone in town hates you! Just the way I like it. Huh? Whoa! Look! It's coming closer! It's a sky beast! Crudlar. A gift from the sky. Hey! Huh? I am the Infinity probe from the planet Earth. We will now perform a full-body examination for purely scientific purposes. Oh. Since the dawn of time, man's indomitable spirit... has led to great achievements in culture and civilization. He's created wonders in architecture, art, music, engineering. But man isn't all work. He likes to play too! I want to live like them. - System control interface operational. - Huh? Manual override engaging. Help me! - Aha! - Huh? A new day has come, and that day is Zartog! The simian program started in the 1960s. And these chimpanzees are like the ones used in the first space missions. - When do they go in space? - Well, they don't. They're just exhibits of the past. Hey, what's up, Comet? I don't know, but something big! What do you mean ""lost""? Senator, the Infinity was drawn off course... by a magnetic attraction from a dimensional anomaly in the time-space continuum. - In English. - It was sucked into a wormhole. My constituents care about potholes, not wormholes. Do you know how many potholes we can fix for five billion dollars? - Area of the pothole. - The power of three. - Multiplied by four. - Cosine. - Multiplied by seven. - Carry the two- 50.6 million! - Depending on fluctuations in asphalt- - Labor costs- - And overtime. - It was a rhetorical question, brainiacs. Our data indicates the Infinity's emerged on the far side of the universe. As you can see from this image... the Infinity has landed on a planet in a crater filled with H20. - It means water. - I know what it means. Senator, if the atmosphere is viable, the planet could sustain life. Maybe even an NFL expansion team. This could prove what we suspected all along. We are not alone. Just think what a mission could do for science. Not to mention T-shirt sales. Political gold. I want astronauts over there pronto. Not gonna happen. Too risky for humans. We don't have a clue how the wormhole will affect living tissue. It could transmogrify the D.N.A., causing blindness. - Heart failure. - Most likely, death. Gripping. Comet, what are you doing? Getting us a mission. - We could send the chimps. - Chimps? Chimps. Hmm. Not humans, but not horrible. Show me what you got. Guys, we got a mission. Senator, Titan, Luna and Comet are fully prepared for the mission. They have been training for this their whole lives. Training, shmaining. These chimps are boring! They're... chimp nerds. Uh, technically, there's no such thing as nerds in the simian world. I know a nerd when I see one. - Do you think he means we're nerds? - No, no. We're super cool. What this mission needs is some P.R., some sizzle to grab the media's attention. It needs a chimp with the right stuff. It needs someone like... him! A real hero, with dignity and nobility. He's been dead for years. But he does have a grandson. Ta-da! Ahh! Oh, ho-ho-ho! Houston, no! Ooh! Oh! Thumb pain. Aah! - When I promised your grandpa I'd look after ya- - Ooh! Ow! I never thought I'd be playin' pick-up sticks with monkey bones night after night. What can I say? I'm an envelope pusher. - I can't do anything halfway. - Yeah? Well, you keep showboatin', and you'll be halfway to the taxidermist. No, no, you can't take him! He belongs to me. Official government business: eminent domain, national security... a lot of other scary black helicopter stuff you don't wanna mess with. Ooh. He's older than I expected. Well, you ain't no spring chicken either. - And you're lookin' for- - Oh, he's so cute! Yeah, I'm a hottie. I am Dr. Smothers, and you are going into space just like grandfather. Space? Wrong answer. You got the wrong Ham, Doctor. Okay. Bye, space lady who's attracted to me. - Hey! - Good to see ya. Take care. - Don't let the door hit ya on the- - Well, uh- He seems very excited to go. Kid, you're throwin' away the only shot you got. This is a chance to make good, live up to your legacy. Hey, I'm the star of my show, not just the warm-up act for some human astronaut. Your grandfather wasn't some warm-up act. He was a NASA astronaut. Got his face on magazines, newspapers, television. - He even met the president. - I met the chief of police once. Ham! He did somethin' to be proud of. Had a dream and went for it. - You got dreams? - I'm living my dream. Whoa! Uh, Houston? We have a problem. Thanks for supporting your government. Under threat of prosecution! I- I'm- I'm gonna need that trailer back. - Huh. - Well, looks like we're gonna need a new cannonball. You like to travel? - Here he comes. - Stand proud. I can't believe it. We'll be flying with the grandson of the great Ham. You sure they said ""grandson""? - Whoa! I know my rights. I'm calling the A.S.P.C. A! - Huh? I demand to talk to my ringmaster! Help! I've been kidnapped! Oh, he's clearly excited to be in a new environment. Oh, God! Good glass. Ow! Commander Titan, navigation and coordinates. Ham. Don't and care. Lieutenant Luna. It's an honor, sir. - Mmm-mmm-mmm. - Yeah. Oh, my. Hello, lady chimp. Do not mind if I ""dooble."" Luna means moon in Latin. That's right, sir. - What do ya know? Two lovers of language. - Name's Comet. Computers and electronics. I look forward to serving with you. Sorry, kid, but I gotta play Poughkeepsie on Saturday. Let's go, Houston! Sir, with all due respect, you've been selected for a mission... of historical significance in the noble pursuit of- Land of the free, home of the brave. Yada, yada, yada. Listen, the only mission I have is to entertain. Watch and learn. - Abracadabble. - Oh, cool! Oh, perfect. He's a joke. Anyway, best of luck, break a leg, blast off-Whatever it is you say. But I gotta bounce. What are those? Rocket packs. We'll be demonstrating them to the press Saturday morning. My ticket home. Quake with fear! Lord Zartog is here. Ho! By now, you are all aware of the insane power... I command with my big, shiny driving machine whatchamathingie. Are there any among you who oppose my rule? Ah, wait. So you're saying you're in charge because that thing landed on your hut? Yes, and if you don't obey me, I will dunk you in the Freznar. You wouldn't do that 'cause I'd be frozen forever. - Exactly! - Not the Freznar! Cold! Anyone else fancy a dip? Good. All of you, get to work! Let's get this party started. The Infinity recorded G's through the wormhole. If the chimps' internal structure cannot withstand the pressure... they will explode like a mouse in a microwave... frying their brains and splattering their guts. Your teeth look amazing! Here comes five G's. Here comes six G's. This thing is going so fast, right? Yoo-hoo! Seven G's. Eight G's. This might be a weird time to ask... but will you help me move next week? It's not even that much stuff. We'll make a day of it! Hey, that was fun. - You guys got a log ride? - My turn. - Oh, poor little Comet. He thinks he's going into space. Three chairs, three chimps. Gee, where we heading for lunch? I'm not eating trans fats anymore. Well, that went well. We'll need you here, Comet. Our eyes and ears. Hey, kid. Did I ever tell you the story of the short-circuiting posigrades in the first Mercury rockets? That was you? It was the day Ham's grandpa and I coined the term... ""So easy a human could do it."" Oh, I don't know what makes me happier- Einstein's unified field theory... or watching monkeys on a treadmill.  I am Titan, I am strong   No one wants to sing along   Get a life, one, two   You're lame Three, four What? And to think, I almost dropped out of Harvard to start a software company. Who's laughing now, Bill Gates? Memorizing sequences is a vital test of the chimps' brain capacity. You guys into sweet jams? When are you gonna straighten up and fly right? - Saturday, about 10:00 a.m. - Ham! I made these radios for the voyage. I think they might work through the wormhole. - Huh. You made these? - Well, I'm good with machines. Listen, kid, thanks for the Bananaberry, but I won't be needing it. Comet, I'll take the radio. Uh- Hey, kid. Special-edition simian space shades. Wow! Thanks! Sweet! My fellow citizens, this mission will travel clear across the cosmos... where we hope to finally answer the age-old question: ""Is there intelligent life out there?"" Review rocket controls. Right thumb go, left thumb stop. Up is right, down is left. - You got that? - Yeah, yeah. Right thumb go, left thumb stop. Now you're seein' it, now you're not. Boop, boop. Where'd it go? Here it is. Hi! I was hiding. Oh! You're missing a link. Chimp up, cannonball. You're not in the circus anymore. Making this giant leap through the wormhole... comes at great risk and danger. Who will blaze this trail for us? The few, the proud... the monkeys! - Awesome! - A historic moment. And here he is-a symbol of our country's once and future greatness... Ham the Third! Thank you, thank you. Hey! To the circus and beyo- That's gotta hurt. Wait! Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! How much fuel is in that backpack? - Oh, boy. - Cool! Ah, wrong way! Incoming! - Chimps gone wild. - Uh-oh! Oh, no! Holy nards! - Heads up! - Save the children! Run for your lives! Whoa! Wow! Oh! Huh? Hey, look! I'm on TV! Oh! Whoa, no! - Crazy monkey! - He's a maniac! Oh, that's not good. He's a joke! Oh. Whoo-hoo! Which way to the circus? Huh? Uh-oh. Ta-da! - Load 'em up. What kind of simulator is this? It looks really realistic. Oh, it is. Okay. I got that out of my system. Wait. Not quite yet. Okay. I'm good. Now, where are we? Uh, guys? The simulated Earth's getting smaller and smaller. This isn't a simulation, is it? We are now officially space chimps. The Horizon has completed its first phase of operation. Oh, wonderful! - There you go. -  Congratulations to us  - Ha! - Yeah! No, that's not straight enough. No, no. Now that- No, it's too straight. Who is this? I don't remember dunking him. No, no! You're doing it all wrong! Move the Flanderk higher. Line up the twobs in a row. Careful with that! It took me all day to dunk. - Splork! - Yes, Lord Zartog? - Kneel to Lord Zartog. - Yes, Lord Zartog. Soon the house of Zartog will be finished. It's going to be magnificent! It's a shame the volcano will destroy it when the three suns line up on Triple Sunday. I'm one step ahead of that volcano. That's why I'm building those. These pipes will divert the Freznar safely away. Nothing will ever destroy the house of Zartog. But if you divert the volcano's Freznar... the entire village will be buried. Exactly! A glorious reflecting pool to reflect my gloriousness... gloriously. - Eh, but-but-but where would we all live? - With me, in my dungeon. How gracious of you, my lord. Commander's log. Stardate: now. Space, the final frontier. I have bravely led- - Oh, stewardess? Can you get me a pillow and a blanket? - Stay in your seat. - It's regulation. - I have bravely led my- Look! No hands, no feet. No tail. Back on Earth, your insubordinate behavior would get you chimp-martialed! - You're not gonna do that the whole trip, are you? - What? Use ""chimp"" to replace real phrases. I tell ya. I'm gonna kill him. Commander! Violence is against the primate directive. - You're right, Lieutenant. - Is love against the primate directive? - Aah! - Listen and learn, cannonball. - The approach sequence must be activated in order. Fire the engines true and fast. Red one first, blue one last. In between, press 3-6-5 if you want to stay alive. - Permission to speak, Commander? - Permission granted. - You're a dork. - I don't like you. Engaging 3-D matrix. - Ready visual imaging. - Fire photon torpedoes! - Aah! - It's go time, cannonball. Oh, yeah? Prove it. - Titan, don't! - You are a threat to the mission! Ta-da! - Oops. I'm sorry. What do you think we should name our kids? What? I'm gonna take off. - You're goin' down! - Orbital stabilizers. Check. - Hey, is this your card? Is this your card? - Auxiliary thrusters, check. - Collision detector, check. - Circus freak! - Not your card, huh? - I can't take this for another light-years! - I gotcha! Here it comes! - Hang in there. Ding-dong-Aah! Easy on the fur, furious George. Unruly crew member has been detained. - Ow! - Enact regulation number 815. What's regulation 815? Guys! I gotta pee! Whoo! Talk about suction! - Ugh. - Oh, and by the way, guys, we lost the toilet paper. Not my fault. - Thrusters aligned for entry. - Wow. Am I glad we're not goin' into that crazy-lookin' thing. Sorry. While on the mission I can only hear real astronauts. Then who did you just say sorry to? - Someone else. - Then why did you just say ""someone else""? - Jerk-boy! - Nitpicker! - Poop-thrower! - Maybe there's some music on the radio.  Hey, monkey-rena  Circus freak! Approaching dimensional anomaly entry. Brace for event threshold. Approaching five G's-Six G's! Eight G's! Must... stay... alert. Losing... consciousness... - now. - Titan! Whoa! Whoa! Come on! Come on! Where's reverse on this thing? - Welcome to InStar. - Oh, thank God. How can I help you? Horizon has entered the wormhole. - Marvelous! - We'll reacquire signal in minutes, seconds. - This better work. - We got three chimps strapped into a 3.7 billion spaceship. What could go wrong? Whoa-ho-ho! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa! Hey, cool, a planet. And we're headed right for it. Oh, my God, we're headed right for it! Wake up! Wake up! You gotta land this thing! Okay, no need to panic. You're just hurtling out of a wormhole on the other side of the universe... at 9,000 miles an hour and no brakes! Pull up! Come on! Steering wheel! Please let one of these be a force field. Please, please, please! - Air bags deployed. - I did it! I am the smartest chimp in the universe! Whoo- No-oh-oh! Aaah! Ow. Whew. Well, that wasn't so bad. Ship stabilized. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! Whoa! Reacquire signal in five, four, three, two, one. I'm heading to Kinko's later if anybody wants me to run off their résumé. You lost the ship? It must be some sort of technical malfunction. Burning microwave popcorn is a technical malfunction. This is a billion-dollar disaster! 3.7, to be exact. Look on the bright side- if they don't come back, we save five grand on cake and balloons. We can always count on the 24-hour fail-safe restart system. You have hours to bring back those chimps... or I'll cut your funding and make this space program history! And I mean every cent. You won't even be able to afford pocket protectors. You monster! Remember, no bucks, no Buck Rogers. Oh. I love Buck Rogers. Who is Buck Rogers? They lost contact! Comet to Luna. Come in, Luna. Must be solar flare interference. I'll hack the mainframe to filter the signal. Shoot, in my day we just yelled louder. Oh, great. We landed in Barstow. Let's see. Elephant's peanut chest. No, not that one. Circus mess hall. Ringmaster's Yugo. Houston's banana closet- Hmm. Whoa. One small step for Ham... one more small step for Ham... and yet another small step- What are you doing out here? Whoa! Testing for gravity? - Yeah, it works. - Who authorized you to open the hatch? Commander. Commander? You are a liability to this mission. Ha! Liability? I was steering this crate while you and Commander Coma were sawing logs! You stayed awake, and you didn't activate the landing sequence? - That's all you had to do. - Not true. I was catching up on my panicking. No! Don't! - What? - The air could be poisonous! Oh, no! Poisonous air! - Lieutenant's log. - Choking. - Air is breathable. - Gasping. - The temperature is normal. - Dying. Winning daytime Emmy. And there is no sign of intelligent life. Blah! Look, the planet has three suns. Amazing. Just like every science fiction movie involving another planet guessed there would be. As you all know, tomorrow is Triple Sunday! Our three suns will come together as one and the volcano will explode! And in honor of this special day, and more importantly, me... I'm throwing a celebration, a sort of palace-warming party. - Your overlord! - What? - Another metal beast fell from the sky! - A metal beast? - Like this one? - Only bigger! Only bigger! Only bigger! - Bigger than mine? - It's not the size of the beast. It's what you do with it that matters, my lord. - Traitor! - I-I'm not a traitor! - Then take it back. - Uh, okay. I take it back. You can't take it back, now it's out there. They all heard. You all heard, right? - Oh! - Splork! - Uh, me? - Congratulations! You're the general. Take a party of warriors and bring me the sky beast. Uh, okay, the tall guy, you with the red belly... guy with the pointy hat and the splotchy one at the back. I'm always picked last. Mount up! Take the Fluvians! Imagine, we're the first astronauts to ever set foot on this planet. These photos will be front-page news. The most important images of the century! Can you get one of my good side? Oops. Forgot. I'm all good side. Maybe take one of me looking heroically, with my chin like this? - Oh, and another one like this. - Clown. Ever alert. Brooding. Poised to strike. Candid. Laughing candid. I've been naughty. Huh? Hmm. Wait, Luna. I wouldn't do that if I were you. This is the first sign of complex life on an alien planet! - Astronauts gather knowledge. It's what we do. - I'd just be a little careful. You? Careful? I'm just saying, that looks like a flower used by Piddles the Clown. I gotta hear this. Piddles is a very cute clown... who has a cute little box covered with cute little flowers. The kids think it's the sweetest thing they've ever seen, until- Boo! A giant snake pops out. Please. I'm a trained astronaut. I know what I'm doing. Trained astronaut? Space chimps are a joke. Is that what you think of your grandfather? Just pick your flowers and let's get back to Earth. If there's no traffic in the wormhole, I can still make the 8:00 show at the circus. - Uptight, scientific, bookworm chimp lady. - Hmm. - What does Piddles do next? - He usually throws a bucket of confetti on the audience... and then runs around smashing pies in his own face. I don't think that's gonna help us here. My Simian Space Manual. There must be something in here about what to do. ""Alien captures. Alien uprisings. - How to say no to an alien probe."" - Manual override! Confetti. I can't explain it. It just scares things. - You sure they're not scared of them? - Huh? I know this sounds crazy, but I think these guys are gonna be super chill. - Death to strangers! - Ooh, great name for a band. Titan! Wake up! The sky beast is ours! Quick, this way! - But we can't leave the ship, or Titan! - Looks like they're leavin' us. Return to Lord Zartog! Titan! Get them! Fire! You should've never left the ship! This is all your fault! Me? I didn't sign up for this! I should be in the makeup trailer, not stuck on an alien planet, saving you! You saving me? I'm the astronaut here. You're just a P.R. stunt! Wow, you are really sinking low. Yeah, well, you deserve it. - No. I mean you're literally getting lower. We're sinking! - Aah! I can't get out! Like we say in the circus, "" The show ain't over till the bearded lady shaves her back!"" - Ew. - It's as gross as it sounds too. Ham! Climb on my shoulders and grab that vine! Excuse me. That's my leg. - They're in the swamp! - Attack! - Now what? - Swing, very stiff one. Swing like the wind! Release your inner chimp! Come on, Luna. Like you're on a trapeze. - I'm not from the circus. - Life's a circus, Luna. Only the tents get bigger. Fire! Tarzan yell! Ham! I can't do this! I'm gonna fall! - Yes, you can, Luna! You can do this! - I can't! Use your shoulders, kick your legs, swing and let go. Shoulders, legs, swing, let go. Shoulders, legs, swing, let go. - Nice! There you go. You're getting it! - Shoulders, legs, swing. - Let go! - You're gettin' it! The chimp has been released! Swing, let go. Hey, check this out, Ham! Whoo! - No! - Whoo-hoo-hoo! - See? Nothing to it! - Ham! Just a couple of chimps swingin' through a jungle of vines with eyes and mouths. Eyes and mouths! Snake one, meet snake two. Whoo-hoo! - Get them! - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - Ham, help! - Luna! Whoo-hoo! It's showtime! Afternoon, ladies. - Some first date, huh? - This is not a date. Oh, yes, it is. And I really hope to see you again. Because we're about to... fall! Ham, what do we do now? Aim for the soft patch. Spread your arms wide. Chin down. Thumbs in. - I hope you know what you're doing. - Are you kidding me? I do this every day of the week. Except Monday. That's my me day. Ham? Luna, chin down. Ham! Whoo! Ham? Ham? You're okay, right? Ham, get up. Come on, Ham. I'm sorry I was rough on you. Sure, you were irresponsible, dangerous and undisciplined... but you saved my life. And you were kind of funny in an unbelievably annoying way. And you were- - Cute? - No. - Handsome? - No. Like Brad Pitt, but way shorter and more hairy? What? Luna, do you copy? - Let me just say one thing. - Luna's alive. You are the most annoying, obnoxious, self-centered creature I have ever met. - Ham's alive. - Luna? Ham? Do you read me? Come in. You're an embarrassment. We can hear them, but they can't hear us. We'll need to calibrate the Gregorian array... replace the helix mirror and cross-feed the surrounding shroud. The only word I understood was ""feed."" Mission log. We are stranded on a hostile alien planet. Commander Titan has been kidnapped. - And we're falling in love! - No, we're not! Ignore that last part. Delete! Delete! - Kidnapped? - Stranded? We gotta get movin', kid. We've lost our ship and have only hours... before the automatic pilot engages and we're stuck here forever. Whoa. What? What do you mean, ""stuck""? The ship has a safety program to automatically fly back to Earth hours after we land. It was in your manual. Was that before or after the chapter on the fleet of rescue ships they'll send to save us? - Ham, we got one chance of getting home. - I've had worse odds than that. Let's get moving. Behold Sky Beast Two, the sequel! Yes! Greetings, aliens! Don't worry. You didn't wake me. I needed to get up. I am Commander Titan. I have traveled through space in search of knowledge... to explore the outer reaches of the universe... make first contact with aliens like yourselves... seal you in Mylar wrap and take you to my home planet to be dissected. - Dissected? - Oh, you know. We lay you down on some nice wax paper, slice you open with a butter knife. Oh? But first, you'll need to form a line... so that I can label and catalog you. Organism one, organism two- Organism three. I am Lord Zartog, ruler of the planet Malgor. Zartog, eh? Your parents named you that? 'Cause you are different. I like you. Is that, uh, with one ""G"" or two? - I'll take that as a one. - Organism four, organism five. - Ow! Ah, there's- There's a lot of you. Whoa. Whoa there, mister. That's space agency property. You're in direct violation of interstellar protocol. But, if you cooperate with me, I will ask the tribunal to go easy on you. Cooperate with you? I'm going to destroy you. I appreciate your honesty. You're a good man, ""Zartig."" And a worthy adversary. - Be proud. - Prepare to be frozen forever. Ha! You don't even know how to use the reticulating micromovement device. Even a first-year cadet knows how to do that. Hmm. Will you show me the secrets of the beast? Negativo. You're not trained. You're not qualified. You're not even insured. Please? I'll do anything. You could help me find my crew. - There are more? - Two others. We, uh, lost them in Gunglevik Jungle. What kind of idiot would go in there? Ham. You gotta admit. Being on a weird alien planet is almost cool. All my life, I dreamed of being a real astronaut, just like your grandfather. - And here I am. - Real astronauts? Wake up, Luna. The only reason we're here is to see if we explode in space. You're wrong. We are real astronauts. - Whoa. - Ham. Which one of us lost our flashlight... that moves... really fast behind rocks and has a head? Cool. Please, I mean you no harm. Hi. I'm Lieutenant Luna. M-My name is Killawallawizzaseywhoha. Oh, great. It's drunk. I'm the last free Luzian from the village of Killawallawazoowahooweewee. We come from Earth. You know, Earth- iTunes, greenhouse gases... David Beckham. Whoa. What's up with the glow-in-the-dark brain case? My head lights up when I'm scared. You don't need to be scared of us. We're your friends. Friends. Are you alone? Yes. My village was imprisoned by Zartog and his sky beast. Its metal claws gave him the power to enslave the planet. Metal claws. The rover! We, too, came from the stars. Yes. I saw you crash. You saw that? That was me! - What? - Do you know where our ship is? - At Zartog's palace. - Can you lead us there? - Don't worry. We'll protect you, Killawallazallawallakillazella. Oh, let's just call her Kilowatt, or we'll be here all day. - Or night. - We will set off in the morning. The journey is perilous. We must cross through the- The Valley of Very Bad Things. It is a land of untold danger, agony and torture... not to mention avian urk flu, death spouts... mad florg disease, the Cave of the Flesh-Devouring Beast... and the Dark Cloud of Id from which no one escapes unchanged! Sleep. You'll need your rest. I could use a little shut-eye. Stay on your side of the planet. You Earthlings have a funny way of showing love. We do, don't we? Night, honey. Up wake, up wake. - Well, that was refreshing. We were asleep for, like- - Five seconds. Yep. Just one of the benefits of living on a planet with three suns. Huh. Follow me. Listen and learn, ""Zelig."" The P.R. 5-13I is a high-performance, all-purpose space exploration vehicle. Rough, rugged and ready... the engineers have outfitted her with defense systems for every situation. - And the million kilowatt internal nuclear power plant... guarantees she's always got enough juice to get the tough jobs done. - Ready to take her for a spin? - Yes! My thoughts exactly. Whoa! Oh, the waiting is just mind-numbing. Well, I really need a Snicker's bar. I don't know about you. I'm allergic to peanuts. Wow. This is even better than circus peanuts. I still can't believe the grandson of the great Ham is a clown. - Hey, I like what I do. - Don't you wanna be a hero? You mean like a sandwich? I wish I could have welcomed you with fruit from our village... but Zartog had it all destroyed. We're sorry, Kilowatt. Why would you build a machine like that? - We didn't. The humans did. - What are humans? They're like us. Well, 99.9 like us. But it's the.01 that makes them own everything. - Don't! - But they're big gumdrops. That is not food. That is a glophopper. Guys, is it just me, or is that a really handsome pile of glophoppers? Hmm. Hey, check this out. Whoo! Why any life-form would want to mimic you... is one of the unsolved mysteries of the universe. - Come on. Bust out the scissors. This rug ain't gonna cut itself. - Ham. I've never danced before. Oh, okay. So we'll take baby steps. Gimme your arm. There you go. Not too shabby. You're a natural. I am? Really? Are you kiddin' me? Absolutely. Whee! I am poppin' as well as lockin'. Now the bus stop, robot, King Tut- Rump dart. Fluvians! Run for it. Ham, we can't outrun them! Man, I love these dudes. Come on! They don't call me the ""Hamster"" for nothing. You know, 'cause, like, my name is Ham and I'm running in a wheel. - Never mind. - Ah! Whoa! Ow! Ow! Ahh. Get 'em! Oh, no! Pull up! Pull up! Yes! Whoa! Ow! We really gotta work on stopping. No, no, wait. Don't leave, gumdrop people. Your stopping skills are great! They are afraid. It is the Cave of the Flesh-Devouring Beast. What is with this planet? Would it kill you to have a Cave of Cute Little Kittens? Ham, we got to finish this mission. We only have hours till the ship takes off. Through the cave is the only way to your ship. Run! Hurry, Luna! I want this party to be remembered forever. Beyond anything Malgor has ever seen. You'll need streamers. Nothin' screams ""festive"" like streamers. I love 'em. Oh, and, uh, some, uh, goody bags for when your guests leave. It's a fun, simple way to say, ""Thanks for comin'."" Splork, grab a pad. - Uh- - Maybe we'll get lucky... and this beast will only devour our flesh with his eyes. Ham? Or not! Ooh! We have to find the exit. - Aah! Ham! - Luna! Help! Aah! - This way! It's too narrow for him to get through! - Help! - Faster! It's gaining on us! Oh! Whoa! Dead end! Oh, no! Come on! - Aah! - Whoa. - Kilowatt, turn yourself off! - Cannot. Too scared. But if we can't get out of here, we're dead! - That is not helping. - Okay, here's a trick. To control your fear, imagine what you're most afraid of... and then imagine overcoming it. - Quick, Ham! It's breaking free! - Come on. You can do it, Kilowatt. - Be brave. - Okay. Control your fear. Control your fear. Control your fear. Control your fear. Control your fear. Control your fear. Control your fear. Control your fear. Wow. It works. The exit! Let's go! - It's blocking the way out. - We're trapped. I have been scared my entire life, but you showed me how to control it. Kilowatt, no! What are you doing? - What I must. - Kilowatt. If you swallow me, I will only grow stronger. - Kilowatt! No! - Ham! Hurry. Why did she do that? Oh, so stupid... and brave. That was the bravest thing I've ever seen. - Whoa. Where are we? - Whoa. This must be the Dark Cloud of Id. Oh, it's making me feel weird... and depressed. I shouldn't even be here. I'm just a low-rent circus chimp. - How does that make you feel? - Like a stupid pet trick. Which is all I am- a joke! I could be replaced by a cannonball. Oh, man. Delirium, cryin', sobbin'. They're runnin' out of oxygen! - Come on, sport. Gotta get through. - I'm almost there. I'm not even a good chimp. I've never once said thank you to Houston. - He's like a father to me. - Oh, Ham. All my life I've been living in my famous grandpa's shadow. How does that make you feel? You know what it's like to live in a shadow? It's cold. I knew I could never become a hero... so I became a clown. I think you've had a breakthrough. I'm afraid your time is up. Here goes. With this much power, they'll hear us for sure. Oh, Lord. - Ham- - You know all that back there, it was just the cloud talking. So- It's okay. Sometimes the conflict between the superego and the id... can cast a long shadow in the soul. I have no idea what you just said. I'm gonna walk this way now. Pathetic groveling slaves of Malgor... welcome to Triple Sunday! Soon the suns will align and the volcano will explode. And a lot of you are not going to live. Ahem! That's your cue.  Do you wanna rock Do you wanna rock   Do you wanna rock right now  Now we party my way.  Do you wanna rock Do you wanna rock right now  Yeah! Dance or dunk. - You. - Who? - You're not dancing. - Yes, I am. - No, that's more of a shuffle. - Nope, a dance. - Shuffle! - Dance! Shuffle! - Shuffle. - Okay. Shuffle. Whoa. That's like the second biggest evil lair I've ever seen. And I've seen two. Hey, there's the ship. And there's the rover! Now it is my thrill to present the main attraction. The monkey who showed me the way. Here's Titan! - Oh, my gosh. Titan! - Oh, my gosh. And he's not asleep. Oh, if we just had our rocket packs, we could rescue Titan from the air. - Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - Uh, we're not paid to think. As a matter of fact, we're not paid at all. Think about that! Uh, wait. Chimps don't leave chimps behind. Luna. I hear ya. I hear ya. I do. But here's what I have to say about it. Let's leave him. - Ham. - Fine. We'll save him. Begin torturously slow dunking mechanism. Uh, ""Zartig,"" now that I've gotten to know you, you seem like a reasonable alien... which is why I'm willing to offer you a plea bargain. No. - Let's go. - Whoa. Here we go, ladies. Sure, go ahead. Dunk me. Now you'll never learn how to use the 3-D radar. - Huh? 3-D radar? - Yeah, oh. Whoa! That's right. 3-D radar. - Luna, follow me. - Roger that. Who's Roger? Is it serious? Tell me, tell me, tell me, please. Flip the bar with the star. Not too far to start the radar. You take the left. I'll take the right. Alert. Chimpanzees incoming. - What? - Yee-hoo! Fire away! Luna! Nice. Now let's get back to the ship... - so I can save you guys and pilot us home. - Whoo-hoo! - Where did those chimps go? - They escaped! Traitor. Commander, launch control is unresponsive. Check diagnostics. - Huh? - Nothing but bells and whistles. But why did they teach us all that stuff if the controls weren't even hooked up? I told you guys. This whole thing was a sham. They wanted to see if our brains still worked after going through a wormhole. - We're Spam in a can. - And we weren't even supposed to open the can. Sorry, Luna, but we're nothin' more than guinea pigs. Actually, the guinea pigs are on the Mars mission. Whee! The ship was on autopilot the whole time. We were never really flying it. We were never really astronauts. - You were right all along. - I didn't want to be right. Besides, that's what humans think of us, not what we should think. Why wasn't I born a rabbit or a squirrel or an art history major? Nobody expects great things from them. Three minutes to liftoff. Well, at least we're safe and goin' home. 1,600 crunches a day... 500 push-ups with each arm- All that training for what? I can't go. - What? - I know we didn't build the probe. But it came from Earth. We did this to them. I can't run away. We owe it to Kilowatt and this planet. I took an oath to return this ship to Earth, and that's what I'm gonna do. - Ham's right. - Huh? - Huh? I'd rather be a hero here on Malgor than a space chump back on Earth. Lieutenant Luna. This is an order. - There goes our ride. - And Titan. Commander! - What about your oath? - Chimps don't leave chimps behind. You, sir, are gonna make me cry. Ham, we need a plan. The commander of the mission comes up with the plan. And your plan is? Well, the plan. Yes, the plan, of course. Since I'm the commander of the plan, whatever plan is my plan. It's not your plan. It's not Ham's- - Titan! - Whoa! Whoa! It's party time. We have contact. The ship has exited the wormhole. Touchdown in seconds. Okay, here we go. History in the making, boys. Roll those cameras. What the- - Whoa. - Oh, no. I'm afraid the chimpanzees did not make it. You think? That's it. Mission canceled. Space program's done. Oh, no. They're gonna be stuck up there. As of tomorrow, this entire agency will be recommissioned into something useful... like one of those places where you design and paint and bake your own plates! He does have a point. That is useful. What about the two chimps still here? Two chimps, two words. ""Animal testing."" - We have to get to mission control. - We're their only chance. Follow me. - Hold on. - Cool. For a 20th-century chimp, you're moving pretty quickly into the st century. Yee-haw! Whoa. I may be old, but I'm aerodynamic. - Whoo-hoo! - Whoa. You're gonna have to keep up, son. Whoo-hoo. - Great plan. - At last. Prepare to be dunked! - Lieutenant Luna. - Yes, Commander? You should have asked Ham to come up with the plan. Three chimps, three coats. Which one first? Is it you? - The big one? - What? Or will it be you, the adorable one? Or all three at once? Well, as commander, the least I can do is make sure... ""Zelbaum"" here doesn't dunk you guys. How would you do that? Because I will teach you the rover's secret to universal domination. - Huh? - The entire universe? That's big, right? - But first, let my crew go. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. What? Tell me. - No, don't. - Titan, don't! - Tell me, tell me, please. - What's he doing? Please tell me. Tell it to me. Tell me please. I'll let you live. So, to dominate the universe, hit the yellow button first. Turn the blue knob and then the green. Then pull the lever in reverse. - Oh, this one? - That's right. Wait. - Wow. You really are stupid. - Yeah. And a really bad poet. Oops. Did I say ""reverse?"" Crudlar. That was a joke. Traitor! Whoo! - Huh? - Huh? Wowzers. - Kilowatt! But how? - Kilowatt, you're alive. We saw the Flesh-Devouring Beast swallow you. He-He's not big on chewing. - But how did you get out? - Um- Don't make me go there. - Ew. - What? You guys need a hand? Does anybody want the ""Zelik""statue? 'Cause I'll take it. You have liberated us from the bonds of slavery. We are eternally grateful. We owe you our lives. - We came. - We crashed. W-We kicked his butt! What? Why'd you have to bring his butt into it? - It's a sayin'. That's how it goes. - No, that is not how it goes. I'm, like, 99 sure that's how it goes. You Earthlings have a funny way of showing love. Luna? Do you read me? Hey, Luna, is that a banana in your pocket? Would you evolve? - Sorry. - Comet to Luna. - Comet? - Luna. Comet. Oh, thank heavens. - You'll never believe what's happening. - We've heard everything. - We've been able to hear you the whole time. - The whole time? Yep. The whole time, son. I'm sorry I kept pushin' you to live up to your legacy. It's okay, Houston. Maybe it's time I do. - What's your status? - Single. - But there's someone I've got my eye on. - Oh. It's Luna, in case you were wondering. Oh, wait. Are we talking about the mission status here? Yeah. Ah, well, everything's okay, but we have no way to leave. - You still got the probe. - The probe? It wasn't designed to return to Earth. We'll just have to ""chimprovise."" You know, I kinda missed your stupid puns. - Thank you. - Titan's right. - You'll need a complete redesign. - How do we do that? Uh, let me put you on with Comet. First, we'll need to re-engineer the aerodynamic skeletal structure. - Got it. Let me put ya on with Luna. - Go ahead, Comet. - Second, you'll need thrust. - Huh. We'd need at least 7.7 million pounds of thrust... to reach the velocity to escape the planet's gravity. We'd never get that kind of thrust without a two-stage rocket. It can't be done. Even if we could build a ship, it'd never get off this planet. Ham? If you can shoot a chimp out of a cannon... you can shoot a ship out of a volcano. Of course! Geothermal energy. We don't have much time. Kilowatt, we're gonna need some help if we're ever gonna get home. Planet Malgor at your service. Let's chimp this ride. I know I said I missed the puns, but that was just unacceptable. Standing by. Awaiting instructions. I need duct tape, and I need it now. Yeah, over there. Right. That's good. We have to move fast. Load up those pipes! Seal 'em up, fellas! Kilowatt, we'll never forget you. Aw, I won't either. Well, she won't win any beauty contests, but she'll fly. - Probably. - Maybe. Hopefully. Eh, let's not over analyze it. The suns are aligning. You must hurry. The volcano is about to erupt. Oh, no. What about reentry? - You're going to need a nose cone. - Nose cone? - Huh? - No time. How are we gonna build a nose cone? Uh, hello? Mission control, Infinity is in the launch chute. - Five seconds. - I can't look. - It's louder than a cannon! - I think I'm gonna be sick. - Ooh! - Ahh! Whoo-hoo! Whoo! We did it! We-We-We-We stopped the Freznar! We're saved! Time to go home. Bye. Bye. Bye. I can see the headlines now. ""Commander Titan returns to Earth."" What will I wear? I mean, what goes with ticker tape? Approaching wormhole threshold. - Here it comes. Take this. - Huh? - But I don't know how. - When we pass out, you've gotta pilot us home. What are you, nuts? I'm not an astronaut. - Are you wearing aluminum clothes? - Um, yeah. - Are you in a rocket? - Yeah. - In outer space? - Yeah. - Are you David Bowie? - No. Then you must be an astronaut. Bring this bird home, hotshot! Whoa! I'm not cut out for this. - Ham? - Luna. I believe in you. Wait. Luna, no. Titan. Titan? Whoa! You keep showboatin'- You're not in the circus anymore. Ham the Third! Your insubordinate behavior will get you chimp-martialed! When will you straighten up and fly right? You're a threat to the mission, cannonball! Believe in yourself, Ham. Grandpa Ham? I can't do this. I'm not you. Well, of course you're not me. You're you. You can do things, son. Just do them your way. Whoa. That's them. They're out of the wormhole. Infinity, welcome back. Ham, do you read me? Shh. The kids are sleeping. Ham, you have to align your ship for reentry. You're coming in too hot. You've gotta reduce your angle for reentry by degrees- - Exactly degrees. - Uh, kind of exactly or exactly-exactly? Exactly-exactly. If you don't nail that reentry window, you'll be space dust. - Great. - Now, engage ailerons. - Check. - Flick the turbulence coolers on. - Uh, check. - Adjust the heat deflectors. And enable gyroscopic stabilizers. Uh-oh. Help! I can't reach it. Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Ham, you're pitching up. - No, no, no, no, no. - Holy out of ""controlly!"" - Hey, need a copilot? Lieutenant Luna. Sure, I do. Mission Control, adjusting our angle to degrees. - Yes! - Oh, mercy. We did it! Florida, we have visuals. What about Commander Coma? Should we wake him up? - We don't need a third wheel on our date. - Luna, ooh. - Lower the landing gear. - Check. Uh, Houston, our landing gear is toast. Oh, boy. I picked a bad week to quit eating bananas. - What now? - Don't worry, son. Low-tech solutions are my specialty. - Ham, remember the circus? - Yeah. - Good. You're gonna crash. - We're gonna crash? But this time, stay on target. - Roger that, Houston. - Oh, why are you smiling if we're gonna crash? Because crashing is what I do best. Yee-hoo-hoo-hoo! Come out with your paws up. Paws? They're chimps. Th-They have hands, with opposable thumbs. - Come out with your thumbs up. - And they don't understand English. Kick it down. Yahoo! Wait, my rug. We all knew. Everybody knew. Everyone knew when you wouldn't go swimming at the office party. Here we go! - Oh! - What was that? I can't hold it! We lost steering control! Uh, Ham! Whoo-hoo! Clutch. I said ""clutch!"" You got it. Oh, Lord. I never thought I'd be saying this, but you gotta crash this ship. What are you doing? No, Luna, don't. I'll see you on the ground. While we close the chapter on space travel... we open an amazing new chapter in ""paint your own plate"" history. Whoa! Just a little bit farther. Luna, you did it! I got control! Yes! The national space program is hereby offic- Oh! Whoa! No! Luna! Whoa! - Oh, man. - Whoa! Whoa! Luna! Luna! Luna, get up! You're okay, right? Oh, this can't be happening. Come on, Luna. I stayed on target this time. I was tryin' to be more like you. - You were always- - Right. - Yeah, and you made me- - Better? Yeah. And- And if I had to be without you- - You won't be. - Luna! Ham. - But how'd you survive? - Chin down, opposable thumbs in. Lieutenant Luna, you crash with style. Cannonball, I was wrong about you. You would've made your grandfather proud. Thanks. I guess I'm just a chimp off the old block. That's a good one. I'll have to use that line. Way to stick the landin', hotshot. I always knew you had it in ya. What can I say? I'm an envelope pusher. Hey, Ham. Official space commander shades. Here's your Bananaberry back. It was almost as good as havin' you with us. The Infinity? - But how? - Impossible. This ship was not designed to return. - It isn't even a ship. - It is a miracle. A major scientific achievement! But who built it? I think we might wanna retest our space chimps' I.Q.'s. Are you implying the chimps built this ship? We may never know who built it, but they brought it home. - Senator! - Senator, were you wrong to shut down the space agency? I-Well, I- I'd like to announce the opening of a high-tech facility... devoted to the exploration of deepest space. With first-class facilities for the chimps... and with a make-your-own sundae bar. - Personalized- - And personalized pocket protectors for everyone! - Excuse me? Excuse me? - Excuse me? - Can I- - Excuse me, over here! Pardon me! Pardon me! Did the chimps encounter alien life? We will have to launch another mission to ever know for sure. - Ready, Luna? - Ready, Captain. - Big fella? - Born ready, cannonball. Streamers! - I love 'em! -  Every one is addressed to me  -  Every one is Every one is  - Whoa. Whoa. -  Every one is addressed to me  - Yippee!  Every one is Every one is, every one is   Can't imagine so many monkeys in the daily mail   And all of them coming anonymously so they leave no trail   Never thought I'd have an admirer from overseas   But someone is sending me stationary filled with chimpanzees   Some chimps in swimsuits Some chimps are swinging from a vine   Some chimps in jackboots Some chimps that wish they could be mine   Starsky and Hutch chimps A chimp who's sitting on the can   A pair of Dutch chimps who send their love from Amsterdam   Another postcard with chimpanzees   And every one is addressed to me   Another postcard with chimpanzees   And every one is addressed to me   If I had to guess I'd say the monkey-sender thinks it's great   He's sending me, maybe she's sending me just to see me get irate   I'm losing sleep and it's gonna be keeping me up all night   I thought it was funny but now I've got money on a monkey fight   Some chimps in hard hats Chimps a-working on a chain gang   Some chimps who love cats Burning rubber in a Mustang   A birthday-wishing chimp A chimp in black like a goth   A goin'-fishin' chimp A British chimp in the bath   Another postcard with chimpanzees   And every one is addressed to me   Another postcard with chimpanzees   And every one is addressed to me   Somehow they followed me even though I packed and moved my home   No matter what they come and they come They won't leave me alone   Another monkey in the mail could make me lose my mind   But look at me shuffling through the stack until I finally find   Some chimps in swimsuits Some chimps in jackboots   Some chimps in hard hats Some chimps who love cats   I've got some shaved chimps That's chimps devoid of any hair  I've got depraved chimps Dressed up in the women's underwear  Another postcard with chimpanzees   And every one is addressed to me   Every one is Every one is   Every one is addressed to me   Every one is, every one is Every one is addressed to me   Every one is, every one is Every one is addressed to me   Another postcard with chimpanzees   And every one is addressed to me   Another postcard with chimpanzees   And every one is addressed to me   And I've got the goin'-fishin' chimp   LeapinLar"
61,2003,Once Upon a Time in Mexico,American,"El Mariachi is recruited by CIA agent Sheldon Sands to kill General Emiliano Marquez, a corrupt Mexican Army officer who has been hired by Mexican drug lord Armando Barillo to assassinate the President of Mexico and overthrow the government. Many years before, El Mariachi and his wife Carolina confronted Marquez in a shootout and wounded the general; in retaliation, Marquez took the lives of Carolina and their daughter in an ambush. In addition to El Mariachi, Sands persuades former FBI agent Jorge Ramírez to come out of retirement and kill Barillo, who had murdered his partner Archuleta in the past. Furthermore, AFN operative Ajedrez is assigned by Sands to tail Barillo.
While monitoring Barillo's activities, Ramírez meets Billy Chambers, an American fugitive who has been living under the protection of Barillo, but can no longer stomach the horrible tasks he's been forced to carry out for him. Ramírez convinces Chambers he will provide him protection in exchange for getting closer to Barillo by tagging Chambers' pet chihuahua with a hidden microphone, and Chambers agrees to complete the deal by surrendering to U.S. authorities once Barillo has been taken down. Sands' assistant, Cucuy, originally hired to keep an eye on El Mariachi, instead tranquilizes El Mariachi and turns him over to Barillo, also offering to reveal the details of Sands's plan. Cucuy, however, is promptly killed by Chambers while El Mariachi escapes from captivity and calls his friends Lorenzo and Fideo to assist him in his mission.
While monitoring Barillo's activity outside a hospital, Ramírez notices armed men storming the building and follows suit. He discovers that a group of doctors have been gunned down and Barillo has bled to death as a result of a botched facial reconstruction, but realizes that the corpse on the operating table is a body double before he is knocked out and kidnapped by the real Barillo and Ajedrez, who reveals herself to be Barillo's daughter. Sands realizes his mission has been compromised, but is too late, as he is captured by Barillo and Ajedrez — who drill out his eyes before sending him out. Despite his blindness, he manages to gun down a hitman tailing him with the aid of a chiclet boy.
As the village celebrates the Day of the Dead during the President's visit, Marquez and his army storm in and attack the presidential palace. Marquez's troops, however, are met with resistance from not only the President's bodyguards, but the villagers and the Mariachis. Sands had instructed El Mariachi to allow the President to be killed before attacking Marquez, but the Mariachis, agreeing that the President is a good man, intervene early and protect him. Marquez enters the presidential palace, only to once again confront El Mariachi, who shoots out his kneecaps before finishing him off with a headshot. Ramírez, who was released from captivity by Chambers, faces Barillo. After Barillo guns down Chambers, Ramírez and El Mariachi kill the drug lord. Sands manages to shoot the sadistic Ajedrez dead outside the presidential palace. Ultimately, Lorenzo and Fideo walk away with the cash that Barillo was using to pay Marquez, and escort the president to safety. Ramírez says goodbye to Sands and walks away, having avenged his partner's death. El Mariachi then gives his share of the cash to his village before walking into the sunset.",6.3,tt0285823,"The man you recommended. The guitar fighter? Wiped out a couple towns single-handedly. A real nut. Yeah. You heard of him. You just didn't know it was him they were talking about. You should meet him. Me. Me. That's me. As long as I'm not the guy that has to make the introduction. Were you in Mexico during the Barillo cartel massacre? No. That's when I first heard about him. He was a legend. They used to say he was the biggest Mexican they'd ever seen. That was total bullshit. He was 5'9"", 5'1 0"", tops. That's no record, but bigger than most of us. But Marquez, that's a different story. Marquez. Marquez. Gen. Marquez. Powerful, dangerous. Marquez, he really had it in for this Mariachi, see. They called him ""Mariachi"" because he used to carry this guitar. A guitar? Believe me, he really knew how to play it too. Look, this story is well-traveled. It might have picked up some embellishments along the way. Just read between the lines. Now, he may not have been the biggest Mexican ever... -All right. -...but she was as deadly... ...as she was beautiful. -There's a girl? -Oh, yeah. There's a girl. When he'd run out of ammo, she'd take over. The most drop-dead gorgeous woman you'll ever see. That's where all the trouble began. She was with Marquez. And when Marquez saw that she was with the Mariachi, well, he went crazy. He hunted him down and fought Mariachi to the death. And then she... ...put a bullet in his heart. Only he didn't die. -I don't know what happened after that. -Would you like some? No. Maybe Marquez caught up with them, or the cartels. But like I said, the man is a myth, a legend. And if he's still living, he's the one you want. Well... ...that is truly unbelievable. Well, I'm not big on telling stories. Where's the money? That's the reason I'm here. I couldn't find a briefcase small enough... ...for 10,000 in cash. It'll do. Just for my own edification, I offered you 50. -Why'd you say no? -I'm not a greedy man. Not looking to get rich quick. Besides, 50,000 is a lot for what you wanted me to find out, you know. You may as just as well put a bullet in my head as cough it up, right? But 10? Ten thousand is civilized. Ten is something we both can live with. Ten might still be too much. You'd kill me over 10,000? You wouldn't dare. You wouldn't dare. Yes, I would. Would you do me the honor? You need to learn to play. That's why you're here. I hear this is a town of Gunmen. We only make guitars here. Mariachi. Which one? I don't know who you mean. I'm honored to be in your presence. But there's someone else who wants to meet you. Keep it. He made that for you. You know, if I was you, son, I'd turn around and go back right now. Go back to where I came from... ...instead of selling my mind and my soul to these cocksuckers. You speak English? I didn't think so. Attempts have been made on me and my family by the cartels. The same cartels that are threatening our freedom... freedom which we must defend to the death. I present to you Senor Blascoe. Please sit. We hear you want to work for us. I too am ready to start a new life. This is your lucky day. Did you order my pibil? -Does it have a name? -They call him ""El."" As in ""The."" I know what it means. Thank you. Alert the Barillo cartel... ...that El has come out of hiding. -I don't think we should-- -Are you a Mexican... ...or a Mexi-can't? I'm a Mexican. Good. Then do as I say. -Nice tune. -Something my brother taught me. I killed him. Yes, I was privy to that information already. How charming. You know, El, if I may call you that... ...I've been doing a little snooping around, and it seems that the cartels... ...have quite a price on your head. I wouldn't want to be you. Tell me, is there anyone who doesn't want you dead? You tell me. I need you to kill a man. El, you really must try this because it's puerco pibil. It's a slow-roasted pork, nothing fancy. It just happens to be my favorite... ...and I order it with a tequila and lime in every dive I go to in this country. And honestly, that is the best it's ever been anywhere. In fact, it's too good. It's so good that when I'm finished, I'll pay my check... ...walk straight into the kitchen and shoot the cook. Because that's what I do. I restore the balance to this country. And that is what I would like from you right now. Help keep the balance by pulling the trigger. -You want me to shoot the cook? -No, I'll shoot the cook. My car's parked out back anyway. You... ...will kill Marquez. Do you remember Gen. Marquez? He's being paid by Barillo... ...to kill the president in an attempted coup d'état. -Attempted? -Oh, no. The president will be killed... ...because he's that piece of good pork that needs to get balanced out. I say ""attempted"" because we don't want Marquez taking power. I need you to put the hurting, so to speak, on Marquez... ...after he's killed the president. Savvy? -So why me? -You've got nothing to live for... ...and, in a way, you're already dead. And Marquez is the man who killed you. So why not return the favor? Go to the church. Meet with an associate of mine named Salome at 3:00. And I will contact you afterwards if we have a deal. Was I right? I guess not. The last shipment of guns that were seized at our border... ...have not been accounted for, Sanchez. You are now off that assignment. Who wants to volunteer? Okay. You, Gomez, it's yours. With el presidente's new campaign against the Barillo cartel... ...their activities are being pushed into the forefront. Large payments, deliveries, whispers of a political takeover. I need new point men, strong and willing. This is a top priority of el presidente. Who wants this? Romero, it's yours. Pick your secondary person. A third, if you have to. That's all. Dismissed. I should take his left nut. You're with us. People of Culiacan. I've come here to bring you a message of peace. Peace that at this moment is being threatened by a group of people that is threatening our nation. People like Armando Barillo. I invite you to gather our forces... ...in order to prevent the destruction of our unity ...and our peace. El presidente, history teaches us no matter how great your armies are... ...you will always need the favor of the inhabitants... ...to take possession of a province. How can you compete with a man like Barillo? He owns Culiacan. He doesn't own its people. Barillo purchased hundreds of homes and ranches... ...in the northern part of Culiacan. And then he has turned around and given these homes to the people. -He's a folk hero to them. -He's also a mass murderer... ...and a drug kingpin. He's trying to make himself a martyr by drawing the people to his side... ...but the people can see through that. Men like Barillo have stolen this country's soul. But my people will stand up for what is right. I'm afraid they're no longer your people, sir. Then I will die fighting. Are you with me? To the death. What's wrong? Everything. This way! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Any suggestions, Miss ""Let's get a room on the fifth floor... ...so we can see the beautiful sunset""? Jump. Swing, swing, swing. -Hang on! -What do you mean, hold on? Let go now! Give me that! Stop the bus. Stop the bus. A vow must be broken. Forgive me... for what I am about to become. -When was your last confession? -An hour ago. -And the name of your priest? -Sands. Okay. You are expected to carry out your assignment to the letter-- -Yeah, I know. -Failure to appear... ...in locations at assigned times... ...results in forfeit of protection, protection you will definitely need. -Yeah. -You'll be paid. Coup d'états, like elections, don't come cheap. So there's plenty of dough floating around. There's more. You will be a free man... ...from Marquez, the cartels, and even from the president... ...who isn't your biggest fan, let's face it. -When do I begin? -Give me a moment. It's a church, hombre. I'm sorry. Are you still standing? Still. Good. Well, the Barillo cartel aren't the nicest of guys, are they? However, you've passed the test. You're gonna do just fine. Assemble your team, and I will call you with further instructions. Over and out. I'm just walking my beat, friend. Mexico's my beat, I'm walking it. I throw shapes, and they catch them. I set them up and watch them fall. Have him meet me at the bullfight at p.m. What? Why would I want that? Why would I want bubble gum? All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, this should hold the both of us over for quite a long time. So I don't ever want to see you again. Fuck off. -Hi. -Hello. The CIA sharing a meal with the FBI. Now, if that isn't interagency cooperation, I just don't know what is. -I'm retired FBI. -A real agent never retires. He just takes it a little easier. -Why are we talking? -You tracked down Armando Barillo... ...for two years when he was running operations out of San Antonio. Spinning wheels. It never led to an arrest. Well, he-- He is, in fact, sitting directly behind you. I know. He settled back in. He's been living here for six years. Can't be touched. Did you know that most agents never even see a top-1 criminal... ...for their entire careers? You brought down two, didn't you? And now your third is sitting in very close proximity. Now, retired or not... ...that has really got to tug on the old short and curlies. I'm a civilian now. Didn't he kill that agent friend of yours? What was his name... ...Archuleta? Yes. Barillo is a Mexican citizen. He cannot be extradited for crimes committed in the U.S. Do you happen to know of a Dr. Guevera? Worked for the cartel. This doctor pumped your friend Archuleta full of drugs, day after day... ...so that they could torture him for two weeks before he died. You must have known that. Dr. Guevera himself having dinner with your prey. I wonder what it is they're up to now. Two weeks of torture, Jorge. Think about that. For your dead friend... ...for the job you didn't finish in San Antonio. Now, are you really going to let it slip away again? I'd like you to have a bite of my pork because it's... ...the world. Announcer It's Mariachi Happy Hour! Get your Mariachi song for pesos. A Mariachi kiss for pesos. And a Mariachi fuck for only pesos! Where the hell have you been? Far away. Still fucking around? Let me get Fideo. I'm here for my guitar. It's his last night. They're firing him. Hey... ...Fideo, it's me. -Still drinking. -Like a fish. I guess we haven't changed so much. I didn't think you'd ever come back for this thing. Neither did I. Are we on? I'll let you know. I'll let you know. Bring him sober. We're gonna need him, so... ...coffee. Lots of coffee. Sometimes a revolution is exactly what's needed to clean up the system. One... ...giant enema, which just so happens to be my area of expertise. Bullfights. Bull hockey. Do you like this? The bull is stabbed, prodded, beaten. The bull is wounded. The bull is tired before the matador... ...ever steps into the ring. Now, is that victory? Of course it is. Wanna know the secret to winning? Creative sportsmanship. In other words... ...one has to rig the game. Go collect. El presidente is giving a speech on the Day of the Dead... ...in the town of Culiacan. He's going to be isolated... ...in the main edificio in the center of the plaza. Very easy access to him if... ...somebody can get you in. Right. You're the man who can do that. I am not the prince. I am the man behind the prince. -I see. -He's not the first prince I've served... ...nor the first one that I've betrayed. -You're a good rat. I like you. -I try. The rest upon completion. -Mucho gusto. -Right. Right. Every goddamn time. What do you want in life? Belini... ...how long have you and I done business together? A long time. And in a way... ...I kind of, almost, could have the tiniest smidgen of respect for you. Almost. But you need to stop farting around. Now, do you have the information that I need on Barillo or do you not? I have what you need. I'm just enjoying this temporary position of power. That make you nervous? You know that withholding vital information from a federal officer... ...is a serious offense. Especially when that officer has paid handsomely for it... ...and wouldn't think twice about ripping that patch off your eyehole... ...and skull-fucking you to death. No. I'm fine. Go away. I am fine. Go away. You're off the hook. Leave me alone. That spill just cost you your life. A little help. Okay. I know it's on you somewhere. Somewhere. All right. Time to get messy. Well, I suppose I should thank you for not sticking it up your ass. However. You're about a quart low. You're gonna pay for that, cop. -Why doesn't my key work anymore? -It's too small. -Stand back. -I just-- I brought you a gift. I'm still mad at you. And trust me, it wasn't easy to get. So.... Come closer and I'll thank you. -Are you trying to give me a boner? -Closer, I said. How about that little tip-off? Guarantees you a big arrest and an accommodation. Even from your twisted little agency. I'm impressed. -But then what? -Want to hear my plan? Either that or I start target practice. Okay. The new president is on a quest to clear out the Barillo cartel. And Barillo has set up a counterattack... ...by hiring a military general named Marquez. He wants him to throw a coup d'état... ...while the president's visiting Culiacan. Now, I have a man inside as insurance... ...to make sure that Marquez never takes power. The last piece of the puzzle... ...is Barillo. Your tip-off assures... ...that Barillo is out of the picture while the battle ensues. In the aftermath of this very healthy revolution... ...I will calmly waltz away with the million pesos... ...that Barillo is prepared to pay Marquez for the coup. -You want me to go with you? -You detain Barillo... ...with the information that you have, then you join me... ...and share the spoils. You meet me two nights from now... ...at La Pileta, p.m. sharp... ...and bring only what's important to you. Oh, yeah. It might get a wee bit dangerous there, sugar-butt. So.... -Can you dig it? -I can dig it. I want my key back. Testing. One, two. Testing. Hello? Can you hear me now? Okay-- Fucking bells. Did you assemble your team? You know I did. -Why are you having me followed? -Oh, yeah, that. Let's just call that a... ...guarantee of compliance, shall we? Because Cucuy also... -...provides protection. -From what? Mosquitoes? Oh, gosh, I really wouldn't mess with him if I were you... ...because he's a bit of a live wire. And he's not the happiest that you killed his man. Oh, yeah, by the way, I have your next assignment. You the Mariachis? This is the back entrance. Make a note of it. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Who are they? Musicians. Why so heavy? Built in amplifier. Play something. All right. Let's go. -I was afraid you couldn't play. -Are you kidding? What we are looking for is support from the people of this state. A man can do a lot alone, but he can do better with his people backing him. I wonder how much we're getting paid for this shit. A man who wants nothing is invincible, cabrón. Hey. Are you gonna tell him that this is his last meal? Is there a particular song you would like to hear? We just played for el presidente, I can't buy half a tequila with this shit! It was meant as an honor. Fuck honor. -We need money. -The score's tomorrow. Enough for all. Even for you, Lorenzo. Why are you suddenly interested in the score? What's in it for you? Only revenge. Much delayed revenge. Go practice. Practice? Playing or shooting? What do you think? I don't think. I drink. -Yeah, hello. -Been following Barillo... -...and the good Dr. Guevera. -Oh, Agent Ramirez, no longer retired. -Good man. Welcome to the fold. -I haven't seen illegal activities yet. Only that Dr. Guevera is scheduled for a medical procedure... ...on November 2. The Day of the Dead. That's tomorrow. Also identified a member of the group as Billy Chambers. A fugitive. We've been wanting to pick him up for some time now. Billy Chambers? Yeah. You sure? -Bet my badge on it. -Well... ...whatever they're up to, I can guarantee you... ...that it's going to happen tomorrow. -So I suggest you-- -What's going down tomorrow? If you see an opening, take it. -What do you know? -Not enough. Get inside. I've got nothing. I gotta get in. I got nothing. Try to make a move. I don't have a move to make. What are you gonna do, stupid? Billy Chambers is on the move. Where are you going? You're buying a taco. This is too easy. Where are the other guys? This is a setup. It smells like a setup. I'm making my move. Billy Chambers. -Well, that depends who's asking. -I thought that was you. -Here, let me pay for this. -Oh, well, thanks. Oh, goddamn it. -Is that real? -Yes, it is. Goddamn. What took you boys so long? Whoa, hey, friend. You ain't gonna need that. Believe it or not, man, I'm ready to go. Let's talk over there. After you. Man, I just wanna get out of here. I've been on the run, hiding out here down in Mexico... ...for the last eight goddamn years. And I've been working for this here cartel for the last four. I ain't got shit. All I got is what I'm wearing on my back. I can't go nowhere. Sort of got me by the balls, you know? Jorge Ramirez. I'll take you in under the FBI's supervision and protection... ...until we can take you back, where you will be prosecuted for your crimes. -In the U.S.? -In the U.S. The things that I've had to do for the goddamn cartel are... -...unspeakable. -You don't know what Barillo's up to? I'm close to the man. I'm real close. But he don't let nobody in, that cocksucker. Can you get him close to Barillo? Him? I need your help. Then you get me out of here. Then I'll get you out of here. Him too. Him too. There's cartel on every corner. Sands told me you handle protection. I don't work for Sands anymore. And since I'm a Mexican, I can do whatever I want. Then I guess I don't work for Sands neither. -Goodbye. -There's a price on your head. I'm going to collect. Why don't you just tell Barillo everything you know. And then maybe he'll just cut off your hands. And if I don't? You know that old man I killed in your village? What if your whole village was next? Would you kill them? Me? They certainly would. Then I guess I have no choice... ...but to kill you all. You... ...are last. That should put him out for a few days... ...and give him some nasty dreams. You have to relax your fingers. Music is pure, from one's soul. If the soul is pure, the music flows free. And if the soul isn't pure? Then you must practice like a motherfucker. I present to you... ...Senor Cucuy. Get this condescending ass out of here. You want me to break his fingers? No. I want you to chop them off. -I was just making a joke. -I wasn't. Sit, please. So... ...you are the man who brought us... ...the Mariachi. The man I work for, Mr. Sands... ...he is using the Mariachi to kill Gen. Marquez. So you want to join us... ...here's how it works. There is the bait. There is the trade. A favor for a favor. So El Mariachi is the trade? You are. This ain't my line of work. This guy's all fucked up. General Marquez is arriving! Bring out the Mariachi! Bring him out to the General! I didn't kill you before. Enough blood had been shed. But I see now... that blood will spill again. General Marquez, the Mariachi is not here. He escaped. You too will escape. Hey, hey, hey, hey, Lore-- Why? Practice shooting, not drinking. We are on. By order of the President, they are searching all vehicles for guns and drugs. That fucker's been blockading all the roads. Take us back another way. By order of the president. Who does this guy think he is? He wants to get rid of me? Fine. I'll get rid of him. Replace him, even. Then I will simply disappear. Hey, vámonos, man. Don't put me out completely. Have my men wait outside. Barillo and Dr. Guevera must already be inside the building... ...having entered through the back or basement. They should be midprocedure. Federal agents. This is going down now. If Barillo wanted to look unrecognizable to authorities... ...he succeeded. Massive tissue loss due to an only partially-completed... ...facial reconstruction wasn't necessarily the cause of death. They switched bodies. Barillo! FBI. He was anyway. Bring him along. Listen, I cannot do everything by myself. I need someone to go in there with me. No. I lost my inside man. Probably dead. And Cucuy, greedy turd that he is, ratted me out and has disappeared. Plus, I'm pretty sure the cartel is shadowing me. Now, listen, I have got a swell bunch of guys intercepting Marquez's army... ...but they've got no guns. I want you to understand me. This is no time to screw the pooch... ...because this is supposed to be the big dance number, all right? Hello? Hello? Are you there? Okay, okay, I'm going to freak right out. I would like the puerco pibil and a tequila with lime. Yeah, listen, I need a new line. This one's been compromised. Okay? Thank you. I'll be waiting here at the La Vaca Volando. That's right. The Flying Cow. You really didn't see it coming, did you? Sorry, baby, I told you I wasn't interested in your scheme. Too small. Oh, my Christ. Is that Barillo? That's the new Barillo. The old Barillo died in surgery a few hours ago. What kind of cartel would have you running its operation? I'm his daughter. You've been spying on my operation for some time. I feel it's only fair to warn you that killing me is crossing the line... ...and you will have every marine from here to Guantánamo Bay... ...up your keister, mister. So just know that. Fortunately for you, nothing you did is worth dying over. You have only seen too much. We are going to make sure that doesn't happen again. On this day of the dead, I offer you a chance for a new life. That sounded a little extreme for a parade. Troops are coming up from the south. -Whose? -Emiliano Marquez. -Well, what do we do? -We stay here. This place is fortified. It's much easier to defend this place than to chance going out in the open. Nicholas? What are you talking about, ""fortified""? Come here! Just stay clear of those windows, sir. You let me handle it. My name is Sheldon Jeffrey Sands. I work for the Central Intelligence Agency. I set them up. I watch them fall. I'm living la vida loca. No! I'm terribly sorry about your chewing gum, but listen. I will give you this... ...if you'll be my eyes. It's a dollar. I meant... ...this. I need you to take me to the center of the city. Is someone following you? It's difficult for me to tell right now because I'm having a bad day. Do you see someone? Yes, he's getting close. Listen, have you ever seen one of these? Have you used one? Don't ever, because they're bad. But what I need for you to do is to aim this... ...at the bad man who's following us and shoot him in the head. Kill him? Oh, yeah. Very mátalo. Close? Okay. Smoke him. Smoke the fucker. Just send him straight to fucking Broadway. What? Okay. Come here. Right or left? Was that my right or your right? Wrong man. Sorry. Look me in the eyes... ...and then kill me. Good boy. Now you're thinking. Take me to the center of the city, where there will be even more dough. For you... for our daughter... for Mexico. In my past, I'd take on evil from the bottom. Now I realize... ...start at the top. The president is a good man. I'll go around back. Meet me in five. Watch him. We could torture him. He's FBI. He's retired. That doesn't count. I was tortured once. I didn't like it. You know what the fucked up thing is? They tore out my left nut. That sort of turned me off of the whole thing. What should we do with him? Let's go eat about it. Hey Snow White, watch that fucking pig. Just lay low. They'll leave us alone. What the fuck?! I don't like military. Get out. -Why are we stopping? -We can't go further. -Why not? -Look out there. It's a coup d'état! I can't see, fuck-mook! I have no eyes. Well, then listen to it, fucker! The military's throwing over the presidency. All hell's broken loose. You guys have to get out now. Keep your money because I'm not moving one inch. Fuck! Now what? -Do you know armor-piercing bullets? -Yeah. These are much better. What do you want in life? Good choice. -You ready? -Yeah. Okay, let's go! It's no longer safe to be here. Let's go. You have a meeting with Gen. Marquez, sir. It feels like you need some protection, sir. Who are you guys? Sons of Mexico, sir. Are we in front of the building? Okay. This is it, kid. I don't hear you running. Why would they want me dead? I've done nothing but help them. What are you talking about? Let me show you something. Look out there! You see? Well, don't look too close, presidente. But your people are out there fighting for you, you understand? Take off your jacket. -This also? -Yes. Put this on. What is this, payoff? This is money someone paid to kill you. And now it's money to save your life, presidente. Here, get some tequila for yourself. Leave here and lock the door. Carolina? She died. Your daughter? She died. and you? Dead. and I? Alive and well. In hell. Everything in its place... You fucking little monkey. Stand up. See anything you like? No. Do you remember a man named Archuleta? Why? I present to you Special Agent Jorge Ramirez. You tortured and murdered Agent Archuleta. He was my partner. He was also my friend. Agent Ramirez, you have to follow certain rules. Oh, I'm retired. Rules don't apply to me any more than they do to you. -Mr. Chambers. -Yes, sir. You're just going to stand there? I'm afraid anything but standing's gonna cost you extra. You leave me no choice. Did you get your man? One of them. If that isn't interagency cooperation, I just don't know what is. See you later. Fuck you. Are you okay? I don't know. You will be. What do you want in life? To be free... Simple."
62,2004,First Daughter,American,"Samantha MacKenzie (Katie Holmes) is the only daughter of United States president John MacKenzie (Michael Keaton). Because of her father's political career, she has been in the public eye her entire life and spent most of her high school years in the White House. Having to deal with lack of privacy and public scrutiny for the most ridiculous things, Samantha has had a sheltered existence and her father has trouble letting her have more freedom yet is too busy to spend time with her. Though her mother Melanie is supportive, she still stands by her husband's decisions, leaving Samantha feeling restricted from having a normal life. Accompanied by Secret Service agents everywhere she goes, Samantha finally believes she has the chance to break out of her cocoon when she is given the opportunity to attend college in California.
In California, Samantha ends up sharing a dorm with boy-crazed Mia Thompson, who finds it difficult when Samantha steals her spotlight, and they form a begrudging partnership. She becomes interested in James Lansome, a college student and Sam's student advisor, since he does not treat her differently because of her father. Unknown to Sam, James is actually a Secret Service agent posing as a residential advisor in order to watch over her.",5.0,tt0361620," Girl Vocalizing   Giggling   Girl Continues Giggling   Man Narrating  Once upon a time, there was a little girl-- -  Girl Giggling  - just like any other little girl. - And like most little girls-- -  Girl  I gotcha.! she loved collecting beautiful things.

So, you're just like any other American family. Whose daughter is heading off to college. Remember, today you're not just the First Lady, but you're also a mom.

Come here. Dad, when Chelsea was at Stanford, her Secret Service backed off. They blended in. They wore Birkenstocks. Sam, I want you to listen to me. A navy blue suit with Birkenstocks is a really bad look. That was another time. This is a real different world we live in, Sam. It is not like I am sleeping around and getting drunk, Dad. Come on.

Huh? Yeah, come on, Miss Mackenzie. Get on up there. What do you say, Samantha? Daddy's not here. Can we hear what you have to say, or do you only do what Daddy tells you?  Crowd  Ooh.!  Crowd Dejected  All right, there you go. Another Mackenzie running away from the real issues. - What was that? - Freedom of speech. They have the right to express their beliefs. Okay, the freedom goes both ways. Why don't you get to speak your mind? - Fine. You wanna know what I think? - Yeah. Well, I think my father's administration... gives a great deal of attention to his domestic agenda. - Take his college tuition-- - Blah, blah, blah. End of sound bite. It's kind of hard to get that stuff out of your head, huh? Well, I know only one thing that can definitely help. What's that?  Yelling, Whooping  I should change. I don't wanna ruin the outfit. It can only improve it. -  Woman Singing Slow Pop  - Come on, Sam!  Continues   Shrieking  - Hey, you okay? - Yes. You? Yeah. I'm Sam. Remember? James. - Hey,you guys, get outta the way.! - You coming or not? Lambda Zeta Phi! Watch and learn! James  Come on, we're going again. Wait a minute,James. Wait up! Hey! -  Sam  Excuse me,James? -  Fades  Um, I had a really good time with you on the slide last night. No. Hey,James, what's your major? - Hi,James.James? - Sam, come on. -James? -  Phone Ringing  -  Ringing  - Sam, I'm trying to sleep. - Hello? - New York Post online. Oh, no. I can't believe I made the Post! Mia Thompson, ladies and gentlemen. Suffice it to say, your father feels like he gave you an inch, and you took a mile. I know. I-I completely understand. I'm-- Listen to me, Sam. You cannot pull a stunt like this again.  Whispering  Look, I don't know who you're groveling to... but the best thing about college is you can hang up. - Put him on. - Are you crazy? He's on fire. Look, Liz, I'll just say, """"Dad, I love you. This is unfortunate, but''-- - Go ahead. I'm listening. - Hi, Dad. Listen, I'm really sorry. What were you thinking, Sam? I know. Yes, it's the roommate, Mia. Just so we're clear, she's the one in the really uncomfortable-looking-- - Thong. - In a thong. - Correct. - Okay. Put her on.  Sighs  Mr. President? Mia Thompson here. Now, with all due respect, although I do think your diplomatic skills are top-notch... I think you really need some serious parenting advice. Really? You know what, Mia? I could not agree with you more. - What? - It's great to know... my daughter is living with such a sensible young woman. You've got that rare thing, Mia. You know what it is? It's character. Some people have it, some people don't. You have it. Really? Thanks. Um, I mean, you too. That whole China thing was real good. Yeah, I can-- I can definitely see how you do what you do. I will. Bye. - He's good, isn't he? - Yeah. Next time, you should be a little easier on him. Okay. But the difference is he's my president and he's your father. Not when he's calling from the Oval Office, he's not. Oval Office, Schmoval Office. At some point, every father's gotta learn to let go of his little girl. And every little girl's gotta learn to let go of her father. How do you do that, Mia?  Crowd Chanting  Vote no. No Mackenzie. Vote no. No Mackenzie.  Crowd Chanting  Vote no. No Mackenzie. Vote no.

Bock Yelling, Indistinct  Mia. Oh, please, is she in there? - Mia, I need your help. -  Clamoring Continues  You. This is the R.A.'s room. Good thing I'm the R.A. then. - What happened to Stewart? - Stewart preferred something a little lower key. You can find him down at the """"C'' Wing if you need him. Sorry to hear that. So, it seems you need a place to hide out a bit. Seems I do. They have to leave sooner or later, right?  Man  When's she coming out? I have a better idea. Here. Put this on. There. And this. Wait here for one minute. -  Sniffs  - You need a Kleenex? Oh, no, I'm fine. Follow my lead. James  Hey, Mike, come on. You gonna leave her in there? Hey, Sam, stay as long as you want. -  Murmuring  -  Woman  Where is she? -  Woman  Thank you very much. -  Man  You too. Good luck. - Mmm. - You hate it, huh? It tastes like freedom. I should warn you I'm a very slow eater. - It's terrible on the system to rush. - Yeah, I can see that. So, there will be plenty of time for discussion. Starting with the topic of you. Tell me something I don't know. - Something you don't know. - Mm-hmm. Okay. Brazil's the only country named after a tree. Bagged lettuce that you buy in the store, they wash it in chlorine. The little parallelogram above your top lip is called the filtrum. Five years or half a decade is a lustrum. Every state in the Union has a town named Springfield. Male turtles grunt.

And you still haven't told me anything about yourself. Trust me. I'm not that interesting. - Ask and see what happens. - Oh. - Thank you for doing all of this. - Excuse me. Otherwise my husband will never believe me. Sure. Oh,your boyfriend can be in the picture too. - He's not my boyfriend. - Oh. You're such a beautiful young lady. - Thank you. - And I'm so glad... that you grew out of that awkward stage. And your bosom came in very nicely. - Would you like me to take the picture? - No, no. I've got it. Oh, that's nice. Yes. Thank you. Really, don't feel obligated to tell me anything about yourself. Truthfully, one quick call to the F.B.I. or the C.I.A.... and I can get your blood type, third-grade class picture... and satellite photos of your ex-girlfriend's homes. I guess you didn't find anything when you were rifling through my stuff earlier. We'll take it slow. What is your major? - Actuarial science. - What actually is actuarial science? Statistics, probability and assessment of risk. But more importantly, uh, it's what my dad did. And what his dad did. So, that's what I'm gonna do. Samantha.! That's them over there across the street.! - Come on. - There they go. Come on! -  Woman Singing Slow Pop  - Please, Sam, one shot.  Continues   Man  Hey, is that them?  Camera Shutter Clicking  - Let's do it again. -Just catch your breath. Come on. - He has a place out here too? -  Continues Low   Woman In Movie  The place used to be the gambling casino. He likes it there because of the memories. - The old ancestral home, huh? - Oh, no. Mr. Murdock wasn't born there, but most ofhis best friends were killed there. You know the police used to raid it and everything.  Chuckles  Your face. No, no, you're all right. The look you get. It's like-- It's like the first time I rode my bike without training wheels. It's like you're experiencing everything for the first time. I am. -  Woman  Would you like something? - You need to try this. Will Fats be surprised? He's expecting us. - I picked you up an hour early. We have lots of time. -  Singing Ends  - You get the bags. I'll undress. - Thank you. - Enjoy it. -  Movie Dialogue Continues  Uh-uh. - What are you doing? - A chocolate snack must be poured directly over popcorn. That way you get that delicious salty sweet mixture... and a little melted chocolate. Sometimes you gotta break the rules. You never know when you're gonna get something inspired. Well, go on, Mackenzie. Break the rules.  Man In Movie  If I had the strength-- Well? It's disgusting. I love it.  Movie Dialogue Indistinct  - Favorite board game? - Clue. Yours? - Poker. - Favorite season? Congressional recess. Venus or Serena? Both. It's a trick question. Favorite dessert? Dinner menu Thursday.

When you're having a conversation with someone... it's only polite to let them get a word in.  Sam Chuckles   Man  A lot of folks, they wanna know: What's that one special secret... - for getting a victory? - Still noJames? Who was I kidding? He's not interested. He was just taking pity on me. Give the guy a little leeway. Between your dad... and your portable set of Men in Black action figures... the boy's taking on a huge job here. ...and that's all you people. On behalf of the Redmond knights, I wanna thank each and every one of you. What we do on the field would not be possible... without what you do off the field. Are you all right? Okay, I need backup. I really like this guy. What happened to all the ones you've been kissing since school started? When I really like a guy, it means I'm not gonna kiss him. All right. Long story short, we went to school together... and I've loved him ever since spandex was in. I asked him to meet me here tonight, but... I never thought he would. Your offensive captain,John Young. Give it up for big Buck Rich on defense. -  Cheering  - Hi, Samantha. Welcome to Redmond. Nice to meet you. Excuse me. It's always about you, Sam. Mia, wait. Where you going? Supposed to hang out. Hey, I'll see you later, all right?  Woman Singing Hip-hop   Continues  So, Mia, did you talk to her about rushing yet? Not yet. Hey, did you invite her to our party? You still wanna invite her after what happened at the last one? Are we supposed to salute or say the Pledge of Allegiance? Hands off the roommate's personals. Only I can touch 'em. Dude, can't believe we're partying in, like, Dorm Room One. """"Hey, Mia, what's she like?'' """"Get to see her naked?'' """"Can we all just stand in line to kiss her ass?'' I'm so sick of all things Samantha.  Man  Does she have a boyfriend? She is so hot. -  Man 2  Oh,yeah. - I don't believe that's any of your business.  Continues, Indistinct  What's going on, Mia? What's going on is this isn't working out. It's too hard. Is it that you don't like living with all the attention, Mia? - Or that you don't like living without it? - Excuse me? I think you're used to being the center of things. As a matter of fact, I am. Naturally. Normally. What you got going on is a whole lot of genetic limelight. I think that you're acting really unreasonably right now. So why don't we just step outside. Maybe calm down. No, I'm not counting to 0. I'm not writing up some itinerary. Right here, right now, let's have this out. And for once, Sam, say something that you wanna say... and not what someone wrote for you. Just be you. Whoever that is. This from a woman who will kiss anyone with lips... but saves abstinence for the one person she really cares about? Well, you know what? At least I can admit I'm messed up. You're so desperate to make everybody like you, you let people use me to get to you... and then you act like you don't see what's happening. You let people use you, regardless of whether I am around, Mia. You make that choice all of the time... so don't blame your genetically lit roommate. And don't draw on my parents. It's not nice.  Woman Singing Hip-hop   Fades  - Oh, my God. -  Door Slams  -  Whistle Blows  -  Cheerleaders, Indistinct  -  Whistle Blows  -  Cheerleaders, Indistinct  You really shouldn't sleep in that position. It's bad for your neck. I deserve it. I'm the devil. See? Oh, you are. I wouldn't wanna be friends with me either. Mm-mmm. Reduced security or not. I just have to face it. My life will never be normal. And what exactly is so bad about that? The last time I had privacy I was in utero.  Snickers  Imagine what it's like to have your whole life picked out for you. Imagine... never being alone and always feeling lonely. All I ever wanted was to get my key... get in a beat-up little Volkswagen, and drive off to college. You think I'm a silly, spoiled kid, completely devoid of gratitude. Actually, I think I completely understand what you're going through. - You do? - This one time, I won the class spelling bee. I couldn't get from point ""A'""to point ""B'"" without people watching my every move. I had to avoid the press, the paparazzi. And the women. My God, the women, Sam. The number of training bras that were left in my locker... could fill the support needs of an entire country. So, listen, about last night. You're my R.A. It's forbidden. I get it. It's actually not just the R.A. thing. Oh, the other thing. Most guys have to deal with meeting the dad. My dates have to charm the commander-in-chief. Note to fathers worldwide: In order to keep your daughters from getting any action... become the president. You were hoping to get some action?  Chuckles  You need some air? I think I could use a little air. I'll just go get changed. Come on. Shh. Shh. Shh. - I got your shoes. Come on. - Oh, thank you. James  My dad used to take me to a spot like this. He would always say that the world was a tough place... and you needed total self-reliance to survive it. He must be proud of you. Yeah, if he was, he definitely wouldn't say so. Let's say you do please your father... and you are completely successful and completely self-reliant... and you know that he's proud of you. Then what? It's tough to imagine, right? Because then you'd actually have to figure out what you want. You've thought about this before, huh? Every day of my life. Excuse me. - Let's get back in there. - Come on. You all right? - How do you do that? - What's that? When I'm with you, I'm just me-- Sam. I'm not the First Daughter. I really like it. You're just-- So are you.  Giggles  All right then, let's get back in there. You lead.  Bell Rings  You beat me. - Oh, no, I kicked your butt. - Thanks. - Usually people let me win. - Sam, you will never have to worry about that with me. Thank you. Good. - Will you show me how you did that? - Mm-hmm. Excuse me. We'll go one more time. Just hers. - I like your bracelet. - Thanks. It's from my dad. It's one charm for every continent... every country and every election he won. It's for all of our trips together. - That's cool. Go ahead. - Huh? Oh. -  Bell Rings  - Oh. - Ah.  Carny  Come on, pitcher. Come on.!  Carny Continues, Indistinct  For your bracelet. Just the first of all the trips you're gonna take on your own. Well, this is my stop. That's your room. I like it. It's nice. Spacious for a double. That's exactly what I said to Mia. - Well, I had fun. - I had fun. All right. Well, I guess I should-- Me too. Well, thank you for tonight. Good night, Samantha. Good night.  Exasperated Sigh  James? - Good night. - Good night. I know you're mad at me right now, but I kissed him. Oh, sorry. I'll just-- No, Sam, stay. Really? Yeah, really? I really need to hang out with my roommate tonight. You should go. All right. I know I'm hard to live with. I know you didn't want to be my roommate. Come with me. - Hey. - Hi. Oh, my God. I can't believe it. It's you! You're here in my room. Sam, allow me to introduce you to our dorm mate... Linda, of Paterson, New Jersey. Plays trombone. My original roommate. - Nice to meet you. - Oh. Don't... move!  Playing """"Hail to the Chief'  - Wow. - Yeah, wow, right? Uh, Linda practices four hours a day. - In her room. - Oh, four. - Isn't that fantastic? -  Hysterical Laughing  Bulletproof glass is looking pretty good right now. Yeah, it's looking great.  Bells Chiming, Distant   Sam  Are we good? Are we all set, Liz? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mia, I need you to come with me. I knew you'd change your mind. Whatever you say.

You mean, my every need? My every whim? Absolutely. Because I can be whimsical. - Nice equipment. - Excuse me? The computers. - Can you hack into any computer in the world? - Yes.

And then when we land, we'll find something to wear. -James. - Hi. Every kind of game imaginable is stacked over here. It's my dad's own private collection. You can sit down.

Do you know that every day I get... at least a half a dozen threats against you-- every day? As your father, I couldn't live with myself if something ever happened to you. As a president... this country can't afford to have anything happen to you right now. What could I do, Sam? What choice did I have? You had the choice to be honest with me. You had the choice not to lie to me-- as my father and as the president.  Sighs, Quietly  Oh, man. Hon, I know you thought he was your friend. If you want,  Inhales  we can replace him. Won't he lose his job? He'll be transferred from First Family detail, but no. No-- Find another position. But not the right position. He's in line to work for me. And, yeah, that's where most agents want to end up. No. He can stay. I really hope someday you understand this. I do. That is what is so disappointing. I thought I'd finally found someone who'd like me for me. So how do you know his feelings for you weren't real? - He was just doing his job. -  Chuckles  That's crap. He wanted you. Watch.

I don't have anything to offer you. You're the president's daughter, for Chrissake. I've spent... almost my entire life with people smiling at me... and laughing at my jokes and telling me how special I am... and how great I am and how nice and smart. And right now I don't know if any of that was true. Maybe it was all some kind of an act. I don't know. What if I was different? What if I was just like everybody else,James? How would you feel about me then? You just don't get it. Things aren't different. What if they were? I think you owe me at least this. Forget image.  Sighs  Forget politics.

Is it that bad? You've gotta know that we are in the race of our lives. We were elected to set an example. They expect more of us. That's the life we've chosen. I didn't choose anything, Mom. And I didn't run for anything. Nobody elected me, remember? Like it or not, chosen or not... you are the daughter of the president of the United States. Your father and I need you. Now, we need to be the First Family. You want me to leave school? When President Harding was elected, Florence Harding said... """"Warren, I got you the presidency. Now what are you gonna do with it?'' So, let's get your father the presidency... again-- see what he does with it. It's his time. You're asking me to join the campaign? Mm-mmm. I'm not asking.  Door Opens   Woman Vocalizing Softly   Woman Singing Slow Pop Waltz   Continues   Footsteps Approaching  Good evening, miss. I guess you heard, Samantha Mackenzie raising money... for her dad's reelection one dollar at a time.  Laughter, Applause  Yes, ladies and gentlemen. That's-- That's the big story. Here's the best part. The Secret Service agent... who knocked out the guy at the bar where Samantha was stripping-- Turns out, that Secret Service agent is her boyfriend. -  Fades  -  Audience  Ooh.! And with the help of hard workin' people like you, we can win this thing. - Thank you, Motor City! -  Cheering   Chanting  Mackenzie.! Mackenzie.!  Continues   Man  We're here to discuss your proposed removal as a disciplinary action. Your record is exceptional, but looking at this report... I have my doubts about your ability to continue as an agent. I understand. So please tell this panel why we should allow you to continue as an agent. My father was an agent. - And my grandfather was before-- - But they're not the ones under review here. You are. And if you had a different father or grandfather, you wouldn't have this opportunity. You know, as a little kid... I always dreamt about standing on the sidelines of history, protecting others-- maybe even the president himself. Well, I had the opportunity to protect a pretty remarkable person. Do you have anything to say to defend your actions? You trained me to expect the unexpected. And I tried... not to feel anything. I tried to keep my distance... but I... fell deeper... and deeper. Ifhaving those feelings means losing myjob... then that's a loss I am prepared to take. You and I know that mistakes made in our line of work could mean someone's life. So I'm sorry. You'll be on suspension pending your removal... and you should start to think about other alternatives. -  Staff Members Chattering Low  -  Man ...his humor, his charisma.  Woman  Have we confirmed these numbers? -  Chatter Continues  - And did she sign for them? - Well, the only thing-- - Well, that's why we chose this venue. - New Hampshire worked, right? - We're not in New Hampshire anymore. - Most people want to hear about foreign markets. - Pardon me. - Hey. How are you doin'? - Good. You okay? Sam... you're unhappy. I get it. But if you're going to be here, be here. Because there's a lot at stake... and I really need you to act like a grown-up right now. Obviously, I understand there is a lot at stake, Dad. I have been standing by your side with Mom my entire life. That's why I came home. You don't have to tell me how important it is to be with the people you love. I am here. If you want me to be a grown-up, then you have to allow it.  Tapping On Microphone, Feedback  - What's goin' on with Sam? - Uh-- - What is it? - Well... remember when she was little and she found that frog... and we wouldn't let her keep it... and she got that really stubborn little... unbelievably cute look on her face? - Yes. - She just made that face again. Man. Here I am about to go onstage-- she puts her old man in his place. - Really? - Yeah. Really. And? And, uh-- - I dunno. Good for her. -  Man  Will someone get the president? - I dunno. Good for her. -  Man  Will someone get the president? -  Woman  It's time to go, Mr. President. - Ready? Let's go.  Woman On Speaker  And as for our president, he's gonna do the same thing... - to this country that she's done to her family-- embarrass it. -  Switch Clicks   Press Secretary  With all due respect, now that we'vejust taken direct hits... on the domestic agenda, and it's the last push before the election-- It's too late to change our position. I don't think we should address it. What do you think, Sam? - I don't really have an opinion, Dad. - Really? Are you sure? Well, I don't know what could be more important than home.  Press Secretary  Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. -  Applause  - Thanks.  Applause Continues, Stops  -  Woman  Mr. President. -  Man  Mr. President. Afternoon, folks.

He's a good agent. I'll see what I can do. Thank you. Did you love him? I loved who I got to be with him. Even though I didn't do anything amazing, for me it was. I felt like I... knew myself for the first time. Love? That too. That's what I thought.

63,2015,Kingsman: The Secret Service,American,"During a mission in the Middle East in 1997, probationary secret agent Lee Unwin sacrifices himself to protect his superior Harry Hart. Hart, blaming himself, returns to London to give Lee's widow Michelle and her young son Gary ""Eggsy"" a medal engraved with an emergency assistance number.
Seventeen years later, Eggsy, having dropped out of training for the Royal Marines despite his intelligence and capability, has become a stereotypical chav.[8][9] After being arrested for stealing a car, Eggsy calls the number. Hart arranges his release. Hart explains that he is a member of Kingsman, a private intelligence service founded by wealthy British individuals who lost their heirs in World War I. Hart, code name ""Galahad"", explains there is a position available, as agent ""Lancelot"" was killed by the assassin Gazelle while trying to rescue Professor James Arnold from kidnappers. Eggsy becomes Hart's candidate. Other candidates are eliminated through dangerous training tests run by operative ""Merlin"", until only Eggsy and Roxy, a candidate he befriended, are left. Eggsy is unable to complete the final test – shooting a dog he has raised during the training process (unaware that the gun holds blanks) – and Roxy is named the new ""Lancelot"".
Meanwhile, Merlin discovers that Professor Arnold has returned to work as if nothing had happened. Hart attempts to interrogate him, but a chip in Professor Arnold's neck explodes, killing him. The detonation signal is traced to a facility owned by Internet billionaire and philanthropist Richmond Valentine, who has recently offered everyone in the world SIM cards that grant free lifetime cellular and Internet connectivity. Hart, impersonating a billionaire philanthropist, meets Valentine face-to-face. Hart learns of Valentine's connection to an obscure hate group's church in Kentucky, and travels there, wearing glasses containing a video transceiver. As Eggsy watches, Valentine activates the SIM cards in the church, triggering a signal that causes the parishioners to become murderously violent. Hart's spy training leaves him as the only survivor. Outside the church Valentine explains what happened, then shoots Hart in the face.
Eggsy returns to Kingsman headquarters and finds that Chester ""Arthur"" King, Kingsman's leader, has a scar on his neck just like Professor Arnold's. King reveals that Valentine plans to transmit his ""neurological wave"" worldwide via satellite network, believing the resulting ""culling"" of the human race will avert its extinction. Only those Valentine has chosen, willing and unwilling, will be unaffected. King tries to poison Eggsy, but Eggsy switches glasses and King poisons himself.
Eggsy, Merlin and Roxy set out to stop Valentine. Roxy uses high-altitude balloons to destroy one of Valentine's satellites and break up the network, but Valentine quickly secures a replacement from a business associate. Merlin flies Eggsy to Valentine's base, where he masquerades as King. Eggsy is discovered by a failed Kingsman recruit, Charlie Hesketh, leading to both Eggsy and Merlin being cornered. On Eggsy's suggestion, Merlin activates the implanted chips' failsafe, killing almost everyone with a chip. An angry Valentine activates the signal and triggers worldwide pandemonium. Eggsy kills Gazelle and uses one of her sharpened prosthetic legs to impale Valentine and kill him, stopping the signal and ending the threat.
In a mid-credits scene, Eggsy, now a full Kingsman agent, offers his mother and half-sister a new home away from his abusive stepfather Dean, who flatly objects to Eggsy's suggestion. Eggsy then dispatches him in exactly the same manner that Hart dealt with one of Dean's henchmen earlier.",7.7,tt2802144,"This is Zero One Alpha. We have secured Falcon. I say again, we have secured Falcon. By the time I count to ten... you will have told me exactly what I need to know. If not the number ten will be the last thing you will ever hear. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Grenade! Sir, get back! Shit. Fucking missed it. How did I fucking miss it? Merlin... I apologize for putting you in this position. You trained him well. James... training is over. Welcome to Kingsman... - Lancelot. - Sir. I'll deal with this mess... personally. I very much regret that your husband's bravery can't be publicly celebrated. I hope you understand. How can I understand? He won't tell me anything. I didn't even know he wasn't with his squad. I'm so sorry, I can't say more. But I would like to present you with this Medal of Valor. And if you look closely on the back, there's a number. As a more concrete gesture of our gratitude, we'd like to offer you... Let's call it a favor. The nature of it is your choice. Just tell the operator, ""Oxfords not brogues,"" and then I'll know it's you. I don't want your help. I want my husband back. - What's your name, young man? - Eggsy. Hello, Eggsy. Can I see that? You take care of this, Eggsy. All right? And take care of your mum, too. So sorry, Professor Arnold. Just a tiny bit more. Oh, for God's sakes, just rip it off. I'm under very strict instructions not to hurt you. Look, you've made a mistake. I'm a university lecturer. - I've got no money. - This isn't about money. - Our boss just wants to talk to you. - Am I meant to find that reassuring? He'll be here soon. He'll explain. Do you like whiskey? Red, get the '62 Dalmore. Honestly, this whiskey, it's amazing. You will shit. I suppose asking to borrow a cup of sugar is a step too far. Professor Arnold... I'm here to take you home. Dalmore. It'd be a sin to spill any. Don't you think? Can you hold these? Please? Thank you. Everything is clean. My kind of welcome. No stomach for violence. I mean, literally. I see one drop of blood, that is me done. I'm like... projectile. Listen, I'm so sorry you had to witness all this unpleasantness, due to our uninvited guest. But I promise you, by the time I've found out who he works for, you and I will be the best of friends. To the shop, please. Arthur's in the dining room, sir. - Arthur. - Galahad. The others were beginning to wonder if we were going to have a double toast. Gentlemen, I'm thankful to say it's been years since we last had occasion to use this decanter. Lancelot... was an outstanding agent and a true Kingsman. He will be sorely missed. To Lancelot. To Lancelot. I intend to start the selection process for Lancelot's replacement tomorrow. I want each of you to propose a candidate and have them report to UKHQ no later than 9:00 p.m. GMT. Thank you. Merlin. Come in. Lancelot was investigating a group of mercenaries who were experimenting with biological weaponry. Glasses, gentlemen, please. Uganda, 2012. Synthetic cathinones. They put it in the water supply of a guerilla army base... rage, cannibalism, multiple fatalities. Chechnya, 2013. Insurgents turned on one another. Indisputably, the work of our mercenaries, but no trace of any chemicals of any kind. So what happened to Lancelot? He tracked them to this property in Argentina. While he had them under surveillance, he became aware they'd effected a kidnapping. So he executed a solo rescue mission, which failed. This is his last transmission. - Who is he? - Some climate-change doomsayer, expounds something called Gaia theory about the world healing itself or some such. But what's curious is he's not actually missing. This is Professor Arnold... at Imperial College this morning. It's all yours. And don't forget your membership proposal. Try picking a more suitable candidate this time. years, and still evolving with the times remains an entirely foreign concept to you. Need I remind you I wouldn't be here if it weren't for that young man? He was as much Kingsman material as any of them. More so. But he wasn't exactly one of us, was he? Let's face it, Galahad, your little experiment failed. With respect, Arthur, you're a snob. With respect? The world is changing. There's a reason why aristocrats developed weak chins. Eggsy? Eggsy, come here. - Got any Rizla, babe? - No. Why don't you do your mum a favor, go down to the shop and get some? - Get them yourself. - Oi. What have I said to you about speaking to Dean like that? Three's a crowd, isn't it? Why don't Dean's poodle go? I'll tell you what. Why don't you take this, go and get some Rizlas, get yourself some sweets... and while you're gone, we'll show your mother how three can be good company. Thanks, babe. Come here. There we go. Is that better? If Dean treats your mum so bad, why don't she leave him? Low self-esteem, that's her problem. Fuck off. Why would she have low self-esteem? Eggsy's mum is well fit. - No offense, bruv. - It's all right. One of these days, I'm gonna smash his face in. Are you mental, cuz? He'd just get that lot to do you and then pretend he knew nothing... about it. Oi! You think you can chat shit about us and we won't do nothing just 'cause our guvnor's banging Eggsy's mum? Pretty much, yeah. Bruv, just leave it. Let's just go, man. It's not worth it. You boys have outstayed your welcome. Leave. What? I'm sorry about that, bruv. Yeah. Mug. They weren't fucking worth it, boys. It's freezing. Why are we walking? - You jacked his fucking car keys, bruv? - Yeah. Now we're gonna nick his car. - Fucking... - Shit. Move, bruv! Hold on, boys. Hey, that's my fucking car! Hey! Hey! Eggsy, I swear, you want to fucking stop it! You're a fucking dead man! Stop it! I'm gonna fuckin' have ya! Come on. Floor it, Eggsy! Floor it! Wanker! Yeah, yeah, Dean, look, it's me. Eggsy just stole my fucking car, yeah. Yeah, I've come out the pub, he's done about doughnuts in my fucking face, and he's drove off. No, I can't have it! He's disrespecting me, and that means he's disrespecting you. Oh, hold up! What the... Come on, Eggsy! Dickhead. Foxes are vermin, cuz. Should've driven it over. Should've done a lot of things. I'll sort this. Get out of the car. I said, get out of the fucking car! Eggsy, there is no such thing as honor amongst thieves. Now, you can start giving me some names of the boys you were with, or you go down. It's up to you. I want to exercise my right to a phone call. Well... I hope it's to your mum, to tell her you're gonna be months late for your dinner. Customer Complaints, how may I help you? My name's Eggsy Unwin. Sorry, Gary Unwin. And... I'm up shit creek. I'm in Holborn police station, and my mum said to call this number - if ever I needed help and... - I'm sorry, sir. Wrong number. Wait! Wait! Oxfords not brogues? Your complaint has been duly noted, and we hope that we have not lost you as a loyal customer. Yeah. You what? I... Yeah. Yes, I totally understand. Eggsy. Would you like a lift home? - Who are you? - The man who got you released. - That ain't an answer. - A little gratitude would be nice. My name is Harry Hart, and I gave you that medal. Your father saved my life. So before you was a tailor, was you in the army? - Like an officer? - Not quite. So where was you posted, Iraq or something? Sorry, Eggsy, classified. But my dad saved your life, yeah? The day your father died, I missed something. And if it weren't for his courage, my mistake would've cost the lives of every man present. So I owe him. Your father was a brave man. A good man. And having read your files, I think he'd be bitterly disappointed - in the choices you've made. - You can't talk to me like that. Huge IQ, great performance at primary school... and it all went tits up. Drugs, petty crime, never had a job. Oh, you think there's a lot of jobs going around here, do you? Doesn't explain why you gave up your hobbies. First prize, regional Under-10s gymnastics two years in a row. Your coach had you pegged as Olympic team material. Yeah, well, when you grow up around someone like my stepdad, - you pick up new hobbies pretty quick. - Of course. Always someone else's fault. Who's to blame for you quitting the Marines? You were halfway through training, doing brilliantly, but you gave up. Because my mum went mental. Banging on about losing me as well as my dad. Didn't want me being cannon fodder for snobs like you! Judging people like me from your ivory towers with no thought about why we do what we do. We ain't got much choice. You get me? And if we was born with the same silver spoon up our arses, we'd do just as well as you... if not better. What the fuck you doing here? You taking the piss? Some more examples of young men who simply need a silver suppository? - No, they're exceptions. Come on. - Nonsense. We haven't finished our drinks. After you nicked his car, Dean says you're fair game. - He don't give a shit what your mum says. - Listen, boys... I've had a rather emotional day, so whatever your beef with Eggsy is, and I'm sure it's well-founded, I'd appreciate it enormously if you could just leave us in peace until I finish this lovely pint of Guinness. You should get out of the way, Granddad, or you'll get hurt and all. He ain't joking. You should go. Excuse me. Excuse me. If you're looking for another rent boy, they're on the corner of Smith Street. Manners... maketh... man. Do you know what that means? Then let me teach you a lesson. Are we going to stand around here all day, or are we going to fight? You fucking dirty, fucking dirty... Sorry about that. Needed to let off a little steam. I heard yesterday a friend of mine died. He knew your father, too, actually. Now, I do apologize, Eggsy. I shouldn't have done this in front of you. No, please, I won't say nothing. I swear. If there's one thing I can do, - it's keep my mouth shut. - You won't tell a soul? Ask the Feds. I've never grassed anyone up. - Is that a promise? - On my life! Much appreciated, Eggsy. You're right about the snobs. But there, too, there are exceptions. Best of luck with everything. In celebrity news, the Richmond Valentine movie premiered in Hollywood last night. The story of the Internet billionaire's rise to power is expected to be this award season's hot ticket. One notable absence from the red carpet was Iggy Azalea, still missing three days after she failed to appear at her Oakland concert. No ransom has been demanded. Eggsy, just go, please, because he's gonna... No, please, don't hurt him! Fuck off! Get the fuck away with you! Shut the fuck up! Who was with you in that fucking pub? I want to know the name of the geezer you was with! - I wasn't with no one! - Who was it? - I don't know what you're on about. - Who was it? - I don't know who you're fucking on about! - Fucking tell me his name! I don't know who you're fucking on about! You... listen to me! I want to know who you was with in that pub. Do you understand? I want to know his fucking name! Because, I swear, I'll rip your head off. - Tell me! - I don't know what you're fucking on about! Tell me! - Just tell him, Eggsy! - Fuck off! Fuck off, Michelle! I could kill you right now, and no one in the whole world will notice! But I would. I have enough evidence on your activities to have you locked up for the rest of your life, Mr. Dean Anthony Baker. - What the fuck?! - So I suggest you leave the boy alone, or I shall be forced to deliver it to the appropriate authorities. Eggsy, meet me at the tailor I told you about. What the fuck's going on here? Eggsy, you fucking maggot! Hey, we got a racer! Hey! Eggsy, you fucking... Come here, son! You wanker! I'll have you, son! I've never met a tailor before, but I know you ain't one. Come with me. Come on in. What do you see? Someone who wants to know what the fuck is going on. I see a young man with potential. A young man who is loyal, who can do as he's asked, and who wants to do something good with his life. Did you see the film Trading Places? No. How about Nikita? Pretty Woman? All right. My point is, that the lack of a silver spoon has set you on a certain path, but you needn't stay on it. If you're prepared to adapt and learn, you can transform. Oh, like in My Fair Lady. Well, you're full of surprises. Yes, like My Fair Lady. Only, in this case, I'm offering you the opportunity to become a Kingsman. - A tailor? - A Kingsman agent. - Like a spy? - Of sorts. - Interested? - You think I've got anything to lose? Since 1849, Kingsman tailors have clothed the world's most powerful individuals. By 1919, a great number of them had lost their heirs to World War I. That meant a lot of money going uninherited, and a lot of powerful men with a desire to preserve peace and protect life. Our founders realized that they could channel that wealth and influence for the greater good. And so began our other venture. An independent, international intelligence agency operating at the highest level of discretion. Above the politics and bureaucracy that undermine the integrity of government-run spy organizations. The suit is a modern gentleman's armor, and the Kingsman agents are the new knights. - How deep does this fucking thing go? - Deep enough. Shit, we're late. Your father had the same look on his face. As did I. Come on. - Galahad. - My code name. Late again, sir. Good luck. In you go. Fall in. Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Merlin. You are about to embark on what is probably the most dangerous job interview in the world. One of you, and only one of you, will become the next Lancelot. Can anybody tell me what this is? - Yes? - Body bag, sir. - Correct. Charlie, isn't it? - Yes, sir. Good. In a moment, you will each collect a body bag. You will write your name on that bag. You will write the details of your next of kin on that bag. This represents your acknowledgment of the risks that you're about to face as well as your agreement to strict confidentiality. Which, incidentally, if you break, will result in you and your next of kin being in that bag. Is that understood? Excellent. Fall out. Roxanne. But call me Roxy. - I'm Eggsy. - ""Eggy""? - No, ""Eggsy."" - Eggy? And where did they dig you up? You know we're not allowed to discuss who proposed us. No need to bite his head off. Charlie's only making conversation, right, Charlie? - I'm Digby. - Digby. Eggy, this is Rufus. Rufus, Eggy. - So, Eggy, are you Oxford or Cambridge? - Neither. - Saint Andrews? - Durham? No, wait, I think we may have met. Did you serve me at the McDonald's in Winchester service station? - No. - It's definitely Saint Andrews. - Just ignore them. - You need a pen? - Cheers. - Amelia, isn't it? - Amelia, Eggsy. - Hi, Eggsy. - Don't take any notice of those guys. - That's what I told him. It's just scare tactics. Classic Army technique. No one's gonna die. Shame. Great. You don't know, the CIA don't know. Nobody knows who this guy is? Fine. Seriously, it's fine. Well, it's not really fine, but it's not why I'm here. Hell, man, you know me. Money's not my issue. I could've retired straight out of MIT, fucked off to some island, let the business run itself. Nobody told me to try and save the planet. I wanted to. Climate change research, lobbying, years of study, billions of dollars, and you know why I quit? Because the last time I checked, the planet was still fucked. Hence, my epiphany. Money won't solve this. Those idiots who call themselves politicians have buried their heads in the sand and stood for nothing but reelection. So I spent the last two years trying to find a real solution. And I found it. Now, if you really want to make the world a better place, I suggest you open your fucking ears, because I'm about to tell it to you. Go on, Mr. Valentine. I'm still listening. As long as you agree to all my terms. - The fuck is this? - What's going on? Oh, shit. Jesus! All right, no one panic. Listen to me. - Stay calm. - Fuck. Loo snorkels, loo snorkels! - Loo snorkels? - Showerheads! - Showerheads?! - She's right. Go! Fucking go! Hey, hang about, what's wrong with the fucking door? Congratulations on completing your first task. Charlie, Roxy, well done. For those of you who are still confused, if you can get a breathing tube around a U-bend of a toilet, you have an unlimited air supply. Simple physics, worth remembering. Eggsy, well done for spotting that was a two-way mirror. He's probably seen enough of them. Yeah, you can all wipe those smirks off your faces. Because as far as I'm concerned, every single one of you has failed. You all forgot the most important thing... teamwork. So much for classic Army technique. Thirty-five. One-oh-five. That's it. That's it. Hello. Can I help you? Yes. I have a question about anthropogenic force. Really? Well, it's actually quite fascinating. My colleague died trying to rescue you, and I'm sure you saw how well trained he was, so I suggest you tell me who kidnapped you and why they let you go. I have no idea what you're talking... I'm not supposed to say it, but it was... Oh, for God's sake, I've barely touched you. Oh, man up! Fuck that guy, whoever he is. I'm gonna... He made me kill Professor Arnold. I goddamn loved Professor Arnold. The good news is we know the emergency and surveillance system work. You know what's not good news? ""My colleague died!"" That's what he said! This is an organization, and they're all over us. Whoever you spoke to... I told you, I made contact with the KGB, MI6, Mossad and Beijing. - They all insist he wasn't one of theirs. - Beijing. So freaky how there's no recognizable name for the Chinese secret service. Now, that's what you call a secret, right? You know what? Fuck it. We need to speed things up. Bring the product release forward. We're only halfway into production, and speeding it will cost a fortune. I look like I give a fuck? Just get it done. As some of you will have learned last night, teamwork is paramount here at Kingsman. We're here to enhance your skills, test you to the limit. Which is why you're gonna pick a puppy. Wherever you go, your dog goes. You will care for it, you will teach it, and by the time it's fully trained, so will you be. Those of you who are still here, that is. Do you understand? Choose your puppy. - A poodle? - What? They're gun dogs. Oldest working breed. Easy to train. A pug? It's a bulldog, innit? It'll get bigger though, won't it? Shit. His MRI shows no signs of concussion. No direct brain trauma at all. - How much longer can he be out? - That's the million-dollar question. We don't know what he was exposed to in there. What about Harry's footage? It didn't stream to his home terminal. Encrypted and uncrackable. If and when he comes around, you might want to have a word with him - about sharing his password. - Is he gonna be all right? We need to have patience, Eggsy. But there's hope, okay? If I were you, I'd concentrate on your training. Make it through the tests. Make him proud. Fuck! Come on, come on, come on! J.B., come on! Come on! I'm not coming last 'cause of you. J.B., I'll shoot you! Goddamn you, I'll fucking shoot you! Merlin said we're not allowed to hold you. Bollocks. Water! - Come on, then! - Eggsy, forget it! Oh, what's wrong, mate? You can't take a joke? Seriously, you'll get thrown out, and it's just not worth it. Maybe I don't give a fuck if I get kicked out! - Do it. Come on, you pleb. - Charlie, fuck off! Yeah, go on, walk away. Dickhead. Come on, J.B. Come on, good boy. You have exactly one hour to complete the test, starting now. New target, meters. You know, it's unbelievable. You're still here, lingering like some big steaming shit that just won't flush. Roger that. Target identified. And how about you shut the fuck up? Positive discrimination, that's what it is. It's like those fucking state school kids who get into Oxford on ""C"" grades - 'cause their mum is a one-legged lesbian. - You don't know fuck all about my grades. Oh, forgive me, I'm sure you're highly educated. Fire when ready. How's that for positive discrimination? I want to thank you both for listening, and I really, really appreciate you traveling all this way, Your Royal Highness. And you, too, Prime Minister. I think this is quite brilliant. It's absolutely brilliant. You are completely crazy. And as for you, Prime Minister I'm speechless you'd even consider this. - Don't touch... - Sorry, Your Royal Highness. But you've got a big role to play in getting the Scandinavian region back on track. You're popular, inspirational, and you have the power to galvanize the people. Now, whether you're on board or not, I'm going to have to insist on getting you somewhere I can ensure your safety. How about you, Prime Minister? You in or out? Well, I think it's about time that a politician did something that... actually made a difference. Too true. - What...? - Take her away. - Drink? - Why not? Guards! Help! Don't worry. No harm will come to the princess. Well, I'm a republican anyway, so it... it really doesn't matter. Release the princess! Okay, you're done. Not so bad, right? Hardly felt a thing. Welcome aboard. Pleasure is all mine. Ever heard of knocking? Only when I'm casing a place to rob. Merlin said you wanted to see me. I hope J.B.'s training is going as well as yours is. Sit. Congratulations on making it to the final six candidates. Your test results were even better than I could've hoped. Come in. Eggsy, I need to have a private conversation. You're dismissed. Nonsense. Let him observe. Might learn a thing or two. As you wish. Take a look at this. Oh, for God's sake, I've barely touched you. Oh, man up! Fucking hell! That is rank, Harry. You blew up his head? It's a bit much, innit? Actually, the explosion was caused by an implant in his neck. Here, under the scar. Did my hardware pick up the signal that triggered it? Fortunately, yes. Unfortunately, the IP address I traced it to is registered to the Valentine Corporation. That's not much of a lead. He has millions of employees worldwide. That Richmond Valentine is a genius. Did you not see his announcement today? No. We each spend on average 2,000 a year on cell phone and Internet usage. It gives me great pleasure to announce those days are over. As of tomorrow, every man, woman and child can claim a free SIM card, compatible with any cell phone, any computer, and utilize my communications network for free. Free calls, free Internet for everyone. Forever. Valentine's assistant has the same implant scar. I think Mr. Valentine and I should have a tête-à-tête. He's having a gala dinner next week. I'll get you an invitation. You need to be careful, though. Since you've been out, hundreds of VIPs have gone missing. No ransom notes, exactly like Professor Arnold. Then I suggest you make my alias somebody worth kidnapping. Fuck, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. - What, don't like heights? - Yeah, it's okay. I've done it before, which is... probably why, come to think of it. Hey, it's gonna be all right. You're top of the class. Listen up. Your mission is to land in the target withou the radar detecting you. If I read you on the radar or you miss the target, you go home. Is that understood? Drop zone coming up, seconds. We got to go. Eggsy, I really don't think I can do this. Of course you can't. Head to the back and I'll show you how, yeah? Come on! Eggsy! Eggsy, wait! Hang on! Roxy, just stop fucking about! Follow me, yeah? Come on! Roxy, it's now or never. Jump! Good girl, Rox, I'm glad you made it! Yeah! Yeah! Come on! My, my, you're all very cheerful. Did you really think it was gonna be that straightforward? Any idiot can read a heads-up display. A Kingsman agent needs to be able to solve problems under pressure. Like what to do when one of your group has no parachute. - What? No parachute?! - Shit! - Who?! - Fuck! - Which one? - What do we do?! I told you. Aim for the target. Come in under the radar. And I hope not to be scraping one of you up. But if I do have to, and you're inside the target, please know I'll be very impressed. - Fuck! - Oh, shit! Everybody listen, I've got a plan! Pair off! Grab the closest person to them. - Rufus, come on! - Oh, fuck! - Rufus! - Oh, shit! I can't! Fuck! Oh, thank God. Rufus, you wanker! Shit, we're an odd number now! - Quick, make a circle! - Fuck, he's right! Boys, let's do it. We pull our cords one by one! When we know who's fucked, the person on their right grabs them. Okay, Eggsy. Good plan, Eggsy. You have seconds. Come on now, hurry. Me first! Oh, fuck! Yes! Okay, me next. See you on the ground, boys. Now me. Fuck! Roxy, no matter what happens now, I've got you, all right? Okay, Eggsy. - Yours first, okay? - Yep. Oh, shit! Shit! Shit! Rox! Fuck. Hugo, Digby. You don't land in the K, you're not in the K. Rufus, you opened too soon. You were all over the radar. All three of you, pack your bags, go home. Eggsy, Roxy, congratulations. You set a new record. Opening at feet, that's pretty ballsy. Well done for completing another task. Fall out. Sorry, sir. But why the fuck did you choose me as the gimp? - Am I the expendable candidate? - No, no, no. You don't talk to me like that. You have a complaint, you come here and you whisper it in my ear. You need to take that chip off your shoulder. Mr. DeVere. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm awfully sorry. I seem to have my dates muddled up. Oh, no, no, no. I canceled the gala because of you. Anybody willing to donate that much deserves their own dinner. Come in. Thank you. Gotta admit, I was really intrigued to meet you. There aren't many billionaires I don't know. I don't doubt it. And, obviously, I had my people look into your affairs, and that's some pretty old money you're from. How'd your folks make it? Property, mostly. Property and the markets. Nothing questionable, if that's your concern. Look, I'm just into finding out what caliber person you are. - I'm sure you understand that. - I most certainly do. - Hope you're hungry. - I'm famished. Good. Grab a seat. - I'll have the Big Mac, please. - Great choice! But nothing beats two cheeseburgers with secret sauce. - Goes great with this '45 Lafite. - A classic pairing. And may I suggest Twinkies and a Château d'Yquem for pudding? I like it. So... you want to donate to my foundation. You are aware that I wound things down in that area, right? Climate change is a threat which affects us all, Mr. Valentine. And you're one of the few powerful men who seems to share my concerns. No, I shut things down because I wasn't getting anywhere. Every bit of research kept pointing to the same thing. That carbon emissions are a red herring and that we're past the point of no return, - no matter what remedial actions we take. - Oh, you know your shit. I sometimes envy the blissful ignorance of those less well-versed in the... shit. As Professor Arnold always said, ""Humankind is the only virus cursed to live with the horrifying knowledge of its host's fragile mortality."" You know, not a lot of people knew about him. You like spy movies, Mr. DeVere? Nowadays they're all a little serious for my taste. But the old ones... marvelous. Give me a far-fetched theatrical plot any day. The old Bond movies! Oh, man! Oh, when I was a kid, that was my dream job: gentleman spy. I always felt the old Bond films were only as good as the villain. As a child, I rather fancied a future as a colorful megalomaniac. What a shame we both had to grow up. Bon appétit. Just give me a couple of days to think over your proposal. I'll have my people get in touch with yours, and it's all good. And thank you for such a... happy meal. - Well, want me to follow him? - Nah. I put a nano tracker gel in the wine. We'll know his every move for the next hours. Finally find out who he works for. Valentine didn't let me out of his sight. All I got was this on the way in. South Glade Mission Church is a hate group based in Kentucky. - FBI have been monitoring them for years. - But you think Valentine is a supporter? No evidence yet of a direct connection, but I'll keep looking. Oh, by the way, our ever-growing list of missing persons now includes Scandinavian royalty. Royal Crown Princess Tilde. Just let me out, you psycho! I told you, you're free to go any time you want, as long as you agree to my conditions. I don't agree, and I am never, ever going to agree! Tough shit. Bitch. I want to speak to the British consul! The list of missing celebrities and dignitaries has continued to grow in recent weeks, and world leaders are coming under increasing pressure to provide answers. We are doing everything in our power to find Princess Tilde. You know, governments and security forces worldwide are working together to find the person behind these abductions. In other news, people all over the world continue to wait in line day and night to get their free SIM cards. Mrs. P. You get one? Yeah. Yeah, I been queuing up all day. This unprecedented giveaway by the philanthropist Richmond Valentine has already seen over a billion cards distributed. At ease. So you thought we were done for the day? Well, we're not. - A party? - Tonight, in London. - Who's this? - Your target. Your mission is to use your NLP training to win over the individual in the photograph in your envelope. And when I say ""win over,"" I do mean in the biblical sense. Easy. Posh girls love a bit of rough. We'll see about that, yeah? We certainly will. Hi. Sorry, I just had to come over and say, amazing eyes. - Are you wearing color contacts? - No! - You so are. - Oh, my God, negging! That's hilarious. I haven't heard anyone try that since the noughties. - Excuse me? - Negging. Saying something negative to a pretty girl in order to undermine her social value. It's supposed to make you want to win his approval. Absurdly basic, neuro-linguistic programming technique. Is it just me, or does this champagne taste a little bit funny? - It's an acquired taste, mate. - I think it's just cheap. Get one of these instead. They're delicious. You know, if you're into seduction techniques, this guy is textbook. See what he just did? It's called an opinion opener. He got you talking with a neutral question, got all of us involved in the conversation, so that you craved individual attention. No, I'm just saying the champagne tastes rank. Lady Sophie Montague-Herring, phone call for you at reception. - Be right back. - We'll see you in a bit, yeah? See you in a bit. Budge up, Rox. I'm feeling a bit rough. - Are you all right? - No. Sorry to eavesdrop, but, you know, there's a much easier way to guarantee getting someone home. Rohypnol. Or even something stronger. Who the fuck are you? Where am I? This knife... can save your life. Fuck! My employer's got two questions for you, Eggsy: What the fuck is Kingsman, and who's Harry Hart? I don't know who the fuck that is! Shit! Eggsy, I just killed two of your friends for giving me the same bullshit answer! Fuck! Just cut the fucking ropes, please! Hey, Eggsy! Is Kingsman worth dying for? F... Fuck you! Congratulations. Bloody well done. How'd the others do? Roxy passed with flying colors. Charlie's up next. Want to watch? Yeah, all right. Oh, fuck. Is Kingsman really worth dying for? No, it fucking isn't! Shit, I'll tell you what you want. Please! Chester King is Arthur. Arthur's head of a spy agency... it's called Kingsman. Get me out of here! Thank you, Charlie. Much appreciated. Come on! That wasn't the fucking deal! Fuck! Oh, fuck! I had such high hopes for you. You're a bloody disgrace. Arthur, I'm sorry. At least untie me. Untie yourself. Arthur... Arthur, please. I'm the fucking son of the... shit! Anyone? Hello? Galahad, Percival, congratulations. Your candidates have reached the final stage of the testing process. As tradition allows, you now have hours to spend with them. Eggsy... you should know your father reached this point. From now on, there are no safety nets, understood? Good. Dismissed. Charlie, time to go home. Fuck you! Fucking Dad's gonna hear about this! ""To pee or not to pee?"" That was the headline the day after I defused a dirty bomb in Paris. - ""Germany - 1, England - 5."" - Missed that game. I was breaking up an undercover spy ring at the Pentagon. My first mission. Foiled the assassination of Margaret Thatcher. Not everybody'd thank you for that one. The point is, Eggsy, nobody thanked me for any of them. Front page news on all these occasions was celebrity nonsense. Because it's the nature of Kingsman that our achievements remain secret. A gentleman's name should appear in the newspaper only three times: when he's born, when he marries, and when he dies. And we are, first and foremost, gentlemen. That's me fucked, then. Well, it's like Charlie said... I'm just a pleb. Nonsense. Being a gentleman has nothing to do with the circumstances of one's birth. Being a gentleman is something one learns. Yeah, but how? All right, first lesson. You should have asked me before you took a seat. Second lesson. How to make a proper martini. Yes, Harry. Goddamn it! This fucking hurts! You're the one who asked for a biometric security system. - What's wrong with a simple switch? - A simple switch?! This is an extremely dangerous machine. It should only be operated by someone as responsible and sane as me. Bad shit can happen if this falls into the wrong hands. Whoa! We done here? Shit! No. Now this one. For the test at the church. This one just has a short range. A simple switch will do. So are you gonna teach me how to talk proper, like in My Fair Lady? Don't be absurd. Being a gentleman has nothing to do with one's accent. It's about being at ease in one's own skin. As Hemingway said, ""There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man. True nobility is being superior to your former self."" Now... first thing every gentleman needs is a good suit. By which I mean, a bespoke suit. Never off the peg. And Kingsman suits are always bulletproof. So let's get you measured, and then, whether you get the job or not, you'll have a lasting and... useful memento of your time at Kingsman. I'm so sorry, sir, but a gentleman is completing his fitting. Fitting room two is available. One does not use fitting room two when one is popping one's cherry. Perhaps I'll show you fitting room three while we wait. - So we going up or down? - Neither. This it? Of course not. Pull the hook on your left. Oh, yes. Very, very nice. Now, you're going to need a pair of shoes to go with your suit. An Oxford is any formal shoe with open lacing. This additional decorative piece is called broguing. - ""Oxfords, not brogues."" - Words to live by, Eggsy. Words to live by. Try a pair. Your weapon scores are excellent, by the way. These you're familiar with. And this is our standard-issue pistol. It's quite unique. As you'll see, it also fires a shotgun cartridge for use in messy close-range situations. - How do they feel? - Yeah, good. Now do your very best impersonation of a German aristocrat's formal greeting. No, Eggsy. That is sick. In the old days, they had a phone in the heel, as well. How do I get it back in? Well, it's coated in one of the fastest-acting neurotoxins known to man, so... very carefully. Now... I've had a lot of fun with this. One of our finest examples of chemical engineering. A poison... harmless when ingested, but at a time convenient to you, can be... remotely activated. Primed. Lethal. And what about these? What do these do? - Electrocute you? - Don't be ridiculous. - It's a hand grenade. - Shut up. You want to electrocute someone, you'll need a signet ring. A gentleman traditionally wears the signet on his left hand, but a Kingsman wears it on whichever hand happens to be dominant. Touch the contact behind the ring, it delivers 50,000 volts. And what about them? What makes them so special? Nothing. That technology's caught up with the spy world. Put it back, Eggsy. Perfect timing. Gentleman's just finished. Mr. DeVere! What a coincidence! You are totally the reason I am here. When you left my house, I was thirsting for that dope-ass smoking jacket you had on, and since I'm going to Royal Ascot, and apparently you need one of these penguin suits... here I am. What are you doing here? What's up, man? Richmond Valentine. This is my new valet. I was just introducing him to my tailor. Another coincidence. So am I. Have you had any chance to think further on my proposal? Most definitely. My people will be getting in touch with you very soon. I guarantee it. A word of advice: Ascot requires top hat. I might suggest Lock  Co. Hatters. - St. James's. - ""Lox,"" as in smoked fish? As in ""locked up."" I have trouble understanding you people sometimes. You all talk so funny. Gentlemen, would you look after him, please? Now, this... is a dope-ass top hat. Gazelle! Let's go ascoting. Your hat looks fine, Gazelle. Come on, don't make me late for the queen. Come on, Gazelle, we're gonna be late. How far is Ascot? How far? - Merlin said you wanted to see me, sir? - Sit down. Pretty dog. - What's his name? - J.B. - As in James Bond? - No. - Jason Bourne? - No. Jack Bauer. Bravo. It pains me to admit it, Eggsy, but I think that one day you might be as good a spy as any of them. Take it. Shoot the dog. This weapon is live. Shoot the dog. Give me the gun. At least the girl's got balls. Get out. I knew you couldn't make it. Go home. Merlin, send in Roxy, please. Welcome... to Kingsman... Lancelot. - Mom? - Eggsy! Oh, God, where have you been? I've been so worried about you. Oh, my days, look how big you've grown. Where is he? I'm fine. Eggsy, please, please, just don't get involved. Ma, I should never have left you on your own. This stops right now. - I'll be right back. - Eggsy... Oi! Dean! Oh, Mugsy. So you're back. What, you gone and nicked a fucking taxi now? Yeah. Can I have a word about my mum's black eye? You want to have a word with me? You get out of that cab, I'll knock you straight back down on your fucking arse. Tell your muppets to go inside, then I'll get out. Go on, lads. There'll be two hits: me hitting him; him hitting the floor. Come on, then, you prick, let's see what you got. Want a bit of me? What are you doing? - What the fuck? No, no! Come on! - Get out of the fucking car! What are you doing? What are you doing, you mug! Go on! You got no bollocks! Come on, bruv, he hit my fucking mum! Come back when you've grown a pair! Mugsy! You throw away your biggest opportunity over a fucking dog. And then you humiliate me by stealing my boss's car. You shot a dog just to get a fucking job. Yes, I did. And Mr. Pickle here reminds me of that every time I take a shit. You shot your dog and had it stuffed? You fucking freak. No, I shot my dog, and then I brought him home and continued to care for him for the next years until he died of pancreatitis. - What?! - It was a blank, Eggsy. It was a fucking blank. - Remember Amelia? - Yeah. She didn't drown. She works in our tech department in Berlin; she's fine. Limits must be tested. A Kingsman only condones the risking of a life to save another. Like my dad saved your life even though your fuck-up cost his. Or have you got him stuffed here and all? Can't you see that everything I've done has been about trying to repay him? Harry, listen to this. Valentine's at last saying something of note. Know what I love about pen and paper? Nobody can hack into this shit. Our worldwide tour was a complete success. We... have total coverall. Like when all your numbers in bingo are crossed out. - Bingo? - Bingo. The game. - You have played bingo, right? - Do I look like I play bingo? Point is... if our tests go well at the church tomorrow, we are good to go. South Glade Mission Church. - Merlin, get the plane ready. - Will do. - Harry, I'm so sorry. I'm gonna do ev... - You should be. You just stay right there. I'll sort this mess out when I get back. And I say to you, bear witness! Watch the news. Watch the news... AIDS! Floods! The blood of the innocent spilled! And yet, there are those who doubt this is the wrath of God. Our filthy government condones sodomy, divorce, abortion... and yet, some still doubt this is the work of the Antichrist! You do not have to be a Jew, a nigger, a whore, Or a atheistic, science-lovin' evolution spouter... Charming sermon. Can you see Valentine anywhere? So, my friends, although he is a just God, he is justly a vengeful one, and there can be no turning back from the Almighty... You sure we're out of range? We're over a thousand feet away. What's wrong? - What if the calculations are wrong? - You just have to trust me. ...Jew, nigger, fag-lovers, and the Devil is burning them for all eternity! Would you excuse me? Where are you going? Hey. What's your problem? I'm a Catholic whore currently enjoying congress out of wedlock with my black, Jewish boyfriend who works in a military abortion clinic. So, hail Satan, and have a lovely afternoon, madam. ...he may, in fact, use us... Oh, shit. He's leaving. I'm starting the test now. Let's hope enough of these freaks have our SIM cards. - Might I ask you to sit down, my friend! - Just leave this church! You just leave this church like the infidel you are! Satan cannot save you now! You will eat your babies! You will drown in the blood of the Lord! He will not save you! Holy fuck! Shit, I can't watch this. Get over here. Geez! Fuck. Galahad, can you hear me? Harry! Harry, what the heck is going on? Could you turn the volume down, please? - I didn't expect it to be that effective. - What kind of response are we talking? A hundred percent. So everyone's been affected, whether they have a SIM card or not. And we get the added benefit of wiping out the Kingsman. Not yet. Fuck! Oh, you need to see this. What did you do to me? I had no control. I killed all those people. - I wanted to. - Clever, isn't it? In simple terms, it's a neurological wave that triggers the centers of aggression and switches off inhibitors. Transmitted through your nasty, free SIM cards, I assume. Do you know what this is like? It's like those old movies we both love. Now I'm gonna tell you my whole plan, and then I'm gonna come up with some absurd and convoluted way to kill you, and you'll find an equally convoluted way to escape. Sounds good to me. Well, this ain't that kind of movie. No! Is he dead? That tends to happen when you shoot someone in the head. It feels good, right? No, no, it does not feel good. It feels fucking awful. What?! You just killed how many people in that church? This is one guy. No, no, no, they killed each other. Okay, send out the countdown clock. This party starts... tomorrow. Arthur? Are you there? Sadly, I am. Assemble the Kingsmen. Can't you see that everything I've done has been about trying to repay him? I see a young man with potential, who wants to do something good with his life. Arthur, Harry's dead. Galahad is dead. Hence, we have just drunk a toast to him. Well, then you know what that psycho's doing. How many people around the world have got those SIM cards? Valentine can send his signal to any of them, all of them. If they all go homicidal at the same time, then... Indeed. And thanks to Galahad's recordings, we have Valentine's confession. The intelligence has been passed on to the relevant authorities. Our work is complete, and a most distinguished legacy for our fallen friend, it is, too. And that's it? Come and sit down, boy. This... is an Napoleonic brandy, and we only drink it when we lose a Kingsman. Galahad was very fond of you. And on this occasion, I think it's acceptable for us... to bend the rules a little. - Are these all Kingsmen? - Yes, they're... founder members. I want you to join me in a toast. To Galahad. To Galahad. Harry says you don't like to break rules, Arthur. - Why now? - You're very good, Eggsy. Perhaps I will make you my proposal for Galahad's position. Provided, of course, that we can see eye to eye on certain political matters. Can you guess... what this is? I don't have to; Harry showed me. You click it, I die. I thought that brandy tasted a bit shit. Bravo. Valentine won you over... somehow. Once he explained, I understood. When you get a virus, you get a fever. That's the human body raising its core temperature to kill the virus. Planet Earth works the same way. Global warming is the fever. Mankind is the virus. We're making our planet sick. A cull is our only hope. If we don't reduce our population ourselves, there's only one of two ways this can go. The host kills the virus, or the virus kills the host. Either way... The result is the same. The virus dies. So Valentine's gonna take care of the population problem himself. Well, if we don't do something, nature will. Sometimes a culling is the only way to ensure that this species survives. And history will see Valentine as the man who saved humanity from extinction. And he gets to pick and choose who gets culled, does he? All his rich mates, they get to live, and anyone he thinks is worth saving, he's keeping them safe, whether they agree with him or not. And you... Eggsy. In Harry's honor, I am inviting you to be part of a new world. It's time to make your decision. I'd rather be with Harry. Thanks. So be it. The problem with us common types is... that we're light-fingered. Kingsman's taught me a lot, but... sleight of hand... Yes, they're... founder members. ...I had that down already. You dirty little fucking prick. It's okay, Lancelot. Put it down. It's verified. Arthur's phone is receiving update texts about getting to safety... - we don't have a lot of time. - What are you gonna do? Question is, what are we gonna do? God knows who's in Valentine's pocket and who's not. We have no choice. We're gonna have to deal with this ourselves. Follow me. - What the fuck is this? - I have no idea. What you're playing with is a prototype personal trans-atmospheric vehicle. It was developed as part of Reagan's Star Wars project. It's pretty basic, but... it should still work. We're gonna take out one of Valentine's satellites. We're gonna break the chain, stop the signal. It'll take him a couple of hours to reroute it, which buys us enough time for you to get me into Valentine's mainframe so I can shut it down. Lancelot, you're gonna be using it. Get into your halo suit. Swedish Prime Minister, requesting permission to land. Permission granted. - Please. - Thank you. - So, how many more are we expecting? - Not many. Most have their own bunkers. I figure we're just getting the really nervous ones. Welcome, Prime Minister. It seems the implant can emit some kind of counter signal to ensure the wearer remains unaffected by the waves from the SIM cards. The waves that turn everyone into a psycho killer. Quite. But what he probably didn't tell anyone is it can also super-heat their soft tissue at his command. Valentine selected his chosen few to get the countdown warning, but he had to be sure they didn't blab to the wrong people beforehand. How does this help us right now? It doesn't. Roxy! Here we go! The higher you go, the more the balloons expand. When you reach the edge of the atmosphere, they'll explode. You'll need to deploy your missile just before that, okay? The edge of the atmosphere. Once you've deployed, you'll need to release for descent fast. Good luck. - You can do this, okay? - Yeah. Eggsy, come on! Time is not our friend. You're getting in on Arthur's invitation. You're gonna need to blend in. - I'm supposed to be Arthur? - His invitation's in his phone. Give them this. Give his real name, Chester King. - What about you? - I'm your pilot... I'm gonna stay here. - Is that gonna fit me? - A bespoke suit... always fits. Just be grateful Harry had it made for you. Get dressed. - What the fuck's wrong with them? - I don't know. Could have something to do with the mass genocide. Give me the mic. Hey-oh! Everybody, listen up! Hello, hello! What the fuck is wrong with you people? I just want to remind you that today is a day of celebration. We must put aside all thoughts of death and focus on birth. The birth of a new age. We mustn't mourn those who give their lives today. We should honor their sacrifice... Has she got my number to call me back? I got a new phone. ...and their roles in saving the human race. We must put aside doubt and guilt. You are the chosen people. When folks tell their kids the story of Noah's Ark - is Noah the bad guy? - No! - Is God the bad guy? - No! How about the animals marching two by two? - No! - Of course not! Yeah, that's it! Let's turn those frowns upside down. Eat, drink and party! And I will see you all in the new age. Rox, it's me. How's the view? - Hideous. - Mine's pretty sweet. - They made you one of these suits yet? - No, not yet. You've got something to look forward to then. We're coming up on Valentine's base. Gotta go. Good luck. Looking good, Eggsy. Feeling good, Merlin. This is November-2-4-7-Charlie-Kilo, requesting permission to land. Permission is granted. Fuck me. Eggsy, we're on. Chester King. Mr. King, welcome. I'm sure you've adhered to Valentine's strict no-weapons policy, - but if you don't object... - Of course. Thank you. Do you have any luggage? Congratulations, Mycroft, you just graduated from my pilot to my valet. - You cheeky... - Understood? Good. Thank you. Eggsy, find a laptop, get me online. The clock is ticking. And remember, try to blend in. Would sir care for a drink? Martini. Gin, not vodka, obviously. Stirred for ten seconds while glancing at an unopened bottle of vermouth. Thank you. Merlin, are you clocking this? Yes, I am. Stay focused. Lancelot, you're doing great. Not much further to go. Yes, Merlin. Eggsy, get me online now. Yep, I'm on it. Lancelot, you're approaching your altitude limit. Those balloons won't last much longer. Prepare to engage missile. Society's dead. Long live society. Amen to that. - I'm Morten Lindstrom. - Chester King. How'd you get online? I couldn't. It's a closed network, you see. Pre-authorized connections only. I've got a fix on the satellite. Do you have the correct time? I think I'm still in my last time zone. Oh, yeah, yeah. Let's see now. Eggsy, I'm in. Get your arse back to the plane, now. - On my way. - Lancelot, good luck! Firing in three, two... - Nice and slow. - Fuck are you doing here? Well, my family were invited, obviously. Now, get the fuck up. Slowly. Oh, shit. Lancelot, hurry up and fire! That other balloon is gonna blow! Yes, Merlin. I've nearly got it. Give me a second! Valentine! I've caught a fucking spy! V-Glass, zoom. Oh, fuck! It's that young valet. Son of a bitch. Got it! Oh, shit. Sound the alarm! I'm not taking any chances. Okay, you send out the two-minute warning. I'm starting the override. All right, let's do this. Countdown initiated. - You see him? - Right here. Eggsy, take a left. Two guards, up ahead. Lancelot, release now! Eggsy, straight ahead, then right. There's two more. All right, everybody on your feet! Countdown to V-day! Welcome in the new age! Flat spin! Eggsy, next left, down the narrow tunnel! Here we go! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Nice! Well done, both of you. It's not working! It's supposed to be working! What the fuck? Yes! Well done, Rox. Good girl. We've lost one of our satellites. Oh, no, no. There's no way I can hack past that. What's going on? Is there a problem? Come on, there's no need for guns. I'm just a pilot. Fuck. Merlin! Get in here! Come on! - Let's get the fuck out of here! - We can't. I can't get into Valentine's machine. He's got biometric security. You're gonna have to get in there and make sure his hand never touches that desk. - Are you taking the fucking piss? - I'm afraid not. Let's have that then. This is mine. I'll show you yours. Good choice. - How long to re-link the satellite chain? - It'll take an hour, maybe two. Bullshit! Just bring these two closer together. But that's not yours. V-Glass, call E-man. E, it's V. Listen, man, I got a little hiccup on this end. I need to piggyback. One of my satellites just went down, but it's right next to one of yours. You read my mind. How long before you make that happen? Go. All right, we should be coming back online. Ten percent. Oh, shit! Eggsy, Valentine's using someone else's satellite. He's going to reconnect the chain. It's going to take him no time at all. It's at percent. Eggsy, it seems Valentine's got a present for you. Get a move on! - Is that Kingsman kid dead yet? - Not yet, but he will be soon. Good. Merlin, I'm fucked. As am I. They're coming at me from both sides. I'm out of options. Rox, Rox, I need a favor. Call my mum. Tell her to lock herself away from Dean. And the baby, and... tell her I love her. Oh, for fuck's sake. Merlin, remember those implants you said were of no use to us? Any chance you can turn them on? All right. My turn to play, Valentine. Oh, oh, no! No, no, what the fuck is he... I can't stop this. Yes, please. No! Oh, my God! That is fucking spectacular! Merlin, you're a fucking genius! What the fuck is happening out there? - Aren't you that princess who went missing? - Can you get me out? If I do, will you give me a kiss? I've always wanted to kiss a princess. If you get me out right now, I'll give you more than just a kiss. You motherfucker. Did you really think I was stupid enough to implant one of those things in my own head? What are you, fucking crazy? All those innocent people killed, and for what? You didn't stop shit! Yeah, fine, I've locked the door. What do you want me to do now? As I said, put your daughter in the bathroom and throw away the key. It's still happening! - You're fucking insane. - Just do it. Eggsy, the signal's started! Get Valentine's hand off that bloody desk now! Sorry, love. Gotta save the world. I'll be right back. Good luck! London. Rio! Get down! You did it! The glass is not gonna hold long. You stay here. Merlin, quickly, how do I get up there? - Keep shooting. I'll find a route. - Understood. Holy fuck! We're back up! We're back up! This is great! - Eggsy! Fuckin' get on with it! - Kick his ass, Gazy! Seoul, Caracas, Mumbai! Kill that motherfucker! He killed all our friends! Eggsy... the world is going to shit! - Is he dead yet?! - Not yet! Stop playing with your food! Kill him! Gazelle! Gazelle! Come on, come on! Kill him! Gazelle...! Hey-hey! Well done, son! Yes! Yes, Eggsy! Well done, Eggsy. And you, Lancelot. I'm so sorry. Mummy would never hurt you. Mummy would never hurt you. I'm so sorry. You okay? Harry would be proud of you, Eggsy. He was right. What's up, man? Is this the part where you say some... really bad pun? Well, it's like you said to Harry. This ain't that kind of movie, bruv. Perfect. Eggsy, where are you going? There's no need for champagne. We got loads in the plane. - Did you save the world? - Yes, I did. So... you gonna come in? Yes, I am. Merlin, the cell's locked... how do I get in? Twenty-six, twenty-five. Merlin... you're the guv'nor. You owe me, Eggsy. Eggsy? Oh, my word. The storm is breaking Or so it seems We're too young to reason Too grown up to dream Now spring is turning Your face to mine I can hear your laughter I can see your smile Slave to love Slave to love And I can't escape I'm a slave to love Slave to love... Michelle, turn that shit off. It's doing my nuts in. I rather like that song. Leave it on, Mum. Mugsy's back. You finally come to have that word with me, have you, son? Or are you gonna run away again and pretend you're going to court dressed like that? Oh, you mean this. No. I know this bloke who's just taken over a tailor's shop on Savile Row. He's given me a job, Mum. Comes with a lot of perks. Including a house. Come and live with me there, Mum. Come on. Sit down, you. Only place she'll be visiting is you in fucking hospital. Do you hear? Just leave him alone, Dean! Eggsy, go. Please, just go, babe. - All right. - Yes, do as Mummy says. Why don't you ask that tailor friend of yours to knock up a nice chicken costume... it'd suit you, you mug. As a good friend once said... ""Manners... ""maketh... man."" - Hey... - Shut the fuck up.

64,2000,Requiem for a Dream,American,"During the summer in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, widow Sara Goldfarb spends her time watching infomercials. Meanwhile, her son Harry occasionally pawns her television set to fund his, his girlfriend Marion's, and his best friend Tyrone's drug use.
After Sara receives a call that she has won a spot on a television game show, she becomes excited about attending it. To fit back into her red dress, the favorite of her deceased husband Seymour's, she attempts to lose weight through unsuccessful diets. At the recommendation of a friend, she visits an unscrupulous physician who prescribes her a regimen of weight-loss amphetamines. She begins losing weight, and is excited by how much energy she has.
Harry and Tyrone plan to sell heroin to make enough to live off; that summer, their small-time dealing business thrives. Harry and Marion plan to open up a dress shop for Marion's designs, and Tyrone dreams of escaping the ghetto to make his mother proud. Sara and her friends wait expectantly every day for the game show invitation to arrive. With the extra money, Harry stops by to tell his mother he ordered her a new television set, but when he implores her to get off the amphetamines, she confesses that the only thing she has to live for anymore is the dream of looking glamorous on a television stage, and the extra attention she receives now from her friends.
As Sara’s tolerance for the amphetamines increases, she craves the high she once had, while becoming frantic about the invitation. When she increases her dosage she develops amphetamine psychosis. During a drug deal, Tyrone is caught in a shootout between the two rival gangs. He flees the scene and is arrested. Harry has to use most of their earned money to post bail. The local supply of heroin becomes restricted, and they are unable to find any for either use or sale. Eventually, Tyrone hears of a large shipment coming, but the price is doubled and the minimum high. Harry, desperate, suggests Marion ask her psychiatrist, Arnold, for money in exchange for sex, straining their relationship. When the drug buy goes bad, Harry returns empty-handed to Marion. He departs after giving her the number of a pimp, Big Tim, who trades heroin for sex. Harry and Tyrone decide that to put their business back on track, they will drive to Florida to buy directly from the wholesaler there.
After a series of horrifying hallucinations, Sara flees her apartment for the office of the casting agency in Manhattan, to confirm when she will be on TV. She is taken away by ambulance and committed to a psychiatric ward where she is subjected to degrading treatments. When none work, the physician induces a barely lucid Sara to approve electroconvulsive therapy.
On the drive to Miami, Harry and Tyrone visit a hospital because of Harry's increasingly infected needle injection sites. The doctor notices the symptoms of drug abuse, and Harry and Tyrone are arrested. Back in New York, a desperate Marion has sex with the pimp to get heroin. Recognizing her addiction, he entices her with a bigger score of heroin if she returns that weekend for a party. Tyrone is taunted by racist prison guards whilst enduring manual labor. Harry’s infected arm is amputated. Sara undergoes violent electroshock therapy. Marion is humiliated as the subject of a graphic sex show.
When Sara's friends come to the hospital to visit, they are distraught by her almost vegetative state. Harry wakes emotionally distraught after the amputation, knowing that Marion will not be visiting him. Tyrone thinks of his mother in prison and suffers from drug withdrawal. Marion comes home from the show and lies on her sofa, clutching her score of heroin. Sara dreams that she is on television, and has won the grand prize, with Harry as the guest of honor.",8.3,tt0180093,"English Subtitles By gogoily gogoilyyahoo.com.cn Juice by Tappy, Juice by Tappy, Oooh, Tappy!

65,2008,WALL-E,American,"In 2805, Earth is an abandoned, dystopian planet covered in garbage, with its people evacuated by megacorporation Buy-N-Large on giant starliners. BnL has left behind WALL-E robot trash compactors to clean up; however, all have since stopped functioning, except one unit who has gained sentience and is able to stay active using spare parts from other units. One day, WALL-E discovers a healthy seedling, which he returns to his home. Later, an unmanned spaceship lands and deploys an EVE probe to scan the planet. WALL-E is infatuated with EVE, who is initially hostile but gradually befriends him. When WALL-E brings EVE to his trailer and shows her the plant, however, she suddenly takes the plant and goes into standby mode. WALL-E, confused, unsuccessfully tries to reactivate her. The ship then returns to collect EVE, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner Axiom.
The Axiom's passengers have become obese and feeble due to microgravity and reliance on an automated lifestyle, including the ship's current captain, McCrea, who leaves the ship under the control of the robotic autopilot, AUTO. EVE is taken to the bridge, with WALL-E tagging along. McCrea is unprepared for a positive probe response, but learns that placing EVE's plant in the ship's Holo-Detector for verification will trigger a hyperjump back to Earth so humanity can recolonize it. However, AUTO orders his robotic assistant GO-4 to steal the plant to prevent this from happening. EVE initially believes WALL-E is responsible for the plant's disappearance.
With the plant missing, EVE is deemed faulty and taken to Diagnostics. WALL-E mistakes the procedure as torture, and in intervening accidentally frees a group of malfunctioning robots and causes both EVE and himself to be designated as rogue robots. Frustrated, EVE takes WALL-E to an escape pod to send him home, but they are interrupted when GO-4 arrives with the plant, placing it in a pod set to self-destruct, which WALL-E enters just before it is jettisoned. WALL-E escapes, saving the plant, and he and EVE reconcile and celebrate with a dance in space around the Axiom.
EVE brings the plant back to Captain McCrea, who watches EVE's recordings of Earth and concludes that they have to return. However, AUTO refuses, revealing his own secret no-return directive A113, issued to BnL autopilots after the corporation concluded in 2110 that the planet could not be saved. He mutinies, tasering WALL-E and deactivating EVE and throwing them both down the garbage chute, then detaining the Captain. EVE automatically reactivates and helps WALL-E bring the plant to the ship's Holo-Detector chamber; AUTO tries to close the chamber, crushing WALL-E when he struggles to keep it open, but Captain McCrea is able to deactivate him and destroy GO-4, while EVE inserts the plant to activate the hyperjump.
Having arrived back on Earth, EVE repairs and reactivates WALL-E, but finds that his memory has been reset and his personality is gone. Heartbroken, EVE gives WALL-E a farewell kiss, which sparks his memory back to life and restores his original personality. WALL-E and EVE reunite as the humans and robots of the Axiom begin to restore Earth and its environment.",8.4,tt0910970," Out there There's a world outside of Yonkers   Way out there beyond this hick town, Barnaby   There's a slick town, Barnaby   Out there Full of shine and full of sparkle   Close your eyes and see it glisten, Barnaby   Listen, Barnaby   Put on your Sunday clothes There's lots of world out there   Get out the brilliantine and dime cigars   We're gonna find adventure in the evening air   Girls in white in a perfumed night   Where the lights are bright as the stars   Put on your Sunday clothes We're gonna ride through town   In one of those new horsedrawn open cars   We'll see the shows at Delmonico's   And we'll close the town in a whirl   And we won't come home until we've kissed a girl  ... ride through town   In one of those new horsedrawn open cars   We'll see the shows at Delmonico's...

66,2002,They,American,"In 1983, a young boy named Billy Parks (Alexander Gould) is frightened and has difficulty falling asleep after waking up from a nightmare. His mother Mary Parks (Desiree Zurowski) comes in to comfort him and assures him the monster he thinks is in the closet is imaginary. As he tries to fall asleep again he sees a dark apparition in his closet staring at him and pulls the covers on top of himself and turns on a flashlight. As he peeks outside the covers he is captured and spirited away by the mysterious apparition.
In present day 2002, the plot focuses on the story of a Psychology grad student named Julia Lund (Laura Regan) and the events that turned her life upside down. As a child she experienced horrifying night terrors that manifested after witnessing her father commit suicide, but has seemingly overcome the problem. She reunites with a childhood friend, a now grown-up Billy (Jon Abrahams). In the diner Billy is constantly startled by the flickering lights as he is now deathly afraid of the dark. He tells her that he believes their night terrors are caused by something otherworldly as he was kidnapped by mysterious creatures as a child and went missing for two days. He warns her to stay out of the dark, before suddenly committing suicide.
Julia stays over at her paramedic boyfriend Paul Loomis' (Marc Blucas) apartment for comfort and to grieve. As Julia is sleeping she is awakened by the ringing of Paul's phone and answers, but with no response. Julia then hears the shower running and investigates but finds no one inside. A mysterious black fluid then erupts from the sink drain and frightens Julia who then opens the bathroom mirror shelf to find an alternate dimension inside with mysterious creatures. Out of curiosity she sticks her hand in only to yank it out coated with the same black matter from the drain which starts to violently break her fingers, she closes the shelf only to encounter a reflection of one of the creatures in the mirror. Paul hears her screams and comes to check on her only for Julia to viciously assault him until she realizes it is him. Puzzled, Paul brings up the possibility that she might have been sleepwalking since she does not appear to remember what happened.
At his funeral, Julia consoles Billy's parents Mary and David Parks (Peter LaCroix) and meets up with two of Billy's friends and roommates; Terry Alba (Dagmara Dominczyk), and Sam Burnside (Ethan Embry), who slowly begin to believe his claims as they also experienced night terrors as children and suspect they are returning. Offended by Sam's careless comment Julia walks away and visits Billy's childhood room and discovers his drawer filled with Energizer and Duracell batteries. Terry then shows up and apologizes for Sam's insensitivity and informs her that Billy used to talk a lot about Julia to her and Sam, about his experiences with the return of his night terrors, and why he was obsessed with staying out of the dark - hence the drawer filled with batteries.
As Julia is driving in the middle of nowhere her radio starts to malfunction and an unknown creature sprints across the windshield as the car mysteriously stops. As she is attempting to fix the problem she notices a mysterious creature in the nearby lake. Nervous, she manages to fix the car issue and as she is attempting to start the car she is startled by a vision of Billy and stumbles onto the road only to nearly get hit by an oncoming truck. Julia visits Paul's apartment for comfort only to discover him drunk with his friends Troy (Mark Hildreth) and Darren (Jonathan Cherry). Disgusted, Julia leaves instantly.
At Terry and Sam's apartment the remaining trio study Billy's diary to learn of his experiences. Terry and Sam then ask Julia if she has experienced any return of the night terrors, which Julia denies. Terry then realizes that Julia doesn't seem to remember the sheer terror she felt as a child and explains the origin of her night terrors which started when she was 5 years old, after witnessing her sister drown in a lake where her family would spend their summers. In one instance, she woke up screaming and her parents comforted her and put her back to sleep. Her mother checked on her a few hours later and she was gone. After searching throughout the entire house her father found her in the dog house, and as he reached in to grab her she stabbed him in the eye with a kitchen knife as she was convinced he wasn't her father and that he was some kind of demon.
Julia is at first skeptical but slowly starts to believe in her friends stories after meeting a little girl named Sarah (Jodelle Micah Ferland), one of Dr. Booth's (Jay Brazeau) patients who also suffers from night terrors which started after her mother's untimely death. Sarah claims ""They"" are going to get her and eat her in her horrible nightmares and the only thing that keeps them away is lights. She then starts picking at a strange mark on her arm; a similar mark that also appeared on Billy's hand, Sam's shoulder, and Terry's ankle. Terry and Sam are soon dragged away by the creatures
Julia finally believes in the stories as her night terrors return and she begins to doubt her perception of the world around her. It turns out her mental illness is caused by creatures only she can see who are attempting to consume her. At a bathroom in a Chinese restaurant she discovers the mark left by ""They"" on her forehead and slowly pulls out a black needle from the mark and she starts to panic. She runs to Paul's apartment out of fear. Paul, now completely convinced that Julia is insane, drugs a drink with a sleeping pill and gives it to her. Paul tells her that everything will be okay and she will soon fall asleep, and he attempts to call Dr. Booth. Realizing he drugged her and knowing she can't risk falling asleep she escapes his apartment and runs to the subway station to vomit the sleeping pill on the tracks, only to get trapped in the station as the closing gates lock her in.
Trapped, she is forced to ride a train home, noticing she is the only passenger on the train, which makes her uneasy. The train's lights start to flicker and the vehicle stops completely. She gets off and sees all the light bulbs burst in the train tunnel, then the train automatically starts and abandons her as the creatures assault her. Julia is continuously attacked by the creatures in the darkness of the tunnel but manages to escape. She is finally discovered by a group of engineers who attempt to help her, only for Julia to violently assault them with shards of glass, being convinced they are not human.
She is hospitalized at a mental institution by Dr. Booth and Paul where she is attacked once more and transported into the separate dimension she previously saw, only this time inside of a closet. Here she screams for help towards Dr. Booth and an orderly, both of whom cannot see her. The closet door is shut by Dr. Booth and the creatures proceed to attack her.",4.8,tt0283632,"Mom? Mommy? Mommy! Are you okay? No. I'm scared. It's just thunder, sweetie. I know. I'm scared of thunder. Can I sleep with you tonight? You're almost six, Billy.

They come for me when it's dark. Honey, nobody's coming for you. Except maybe me if you don't go to sleep. Okay? Okay. Check first? Yes sir. Do you want to look? Daddy and I are right downstairs. If you pull the covers over your head, you're safe, right? Right. Okay. I'll leave the door open a crack, okay? Okay. Mom? Mommy? Mommy! It's mom. I'm not going to make my Friday visit, but honey... What else is new? You got to keep up with those pills. Yes mother. Julia, hi, Doctor Crowley. The thirteenth's fine for your thesis defense. Say nine a.m. I'll let Professor Essex know. Please confirm as soon as you can. Thanks. Jules, take off the bike shorts and listen to me... The ambulance threw a rod so Im switching shifts and I got the night off, are you free? Julia, it's Kim. Join us here in the 21st century, huh, get e-mail. I hate e-mail. Think of it as an actual ""date"". Foreign concept, I know, but a break just might free your fevered mind. I can't go out tonight, I have to study. And dont say ""I cant go out tonight, I have to study."" Im picking you up at eight. Youve done a year of research. Presented your thesis... So all that's left's the defense, right? Hmm hmm. Then I've got my Masters. Great. Then you can psychoanalyze me. Well, I can do that now. C'mon, give me credit for being a little mysterious. Raised by puritanical Midwestern parents, you are hardworking, honest to a fault, and very, very empathetic. Okay, my turn. Raised by an overbearing mother, you're passionate, driven, maybe to a fault, and just a little bit moody. Moody? The highs are high, the lows are low. It means you feel. That's a good thing. Trust me. That's why we're good together. Body and soul. Playing a good game of pool is a sign of being well-rounded, you know. Says who? - Some dead English guy. What do you want me to say? I'm feeling it. Let's see if you ""feel it"" when something's riding on it. Twenty's yours if you sink it. - Alright. No pressure. Oh. One more time. Double or nothing. Driven to a fault, remember? - It's your money. Alright. Here we go. ... steadfast in their stance on the issue. Earlier this week civic government announced... Hey, what's up? - Hey. Uh... sorry we're home. We were just - actually - uh... Reese kind of flaked on us so we decided to be domestic. ... power crises intensify, the specter of rolling blackouts goes from threat to reality. Speaking of, you guys pay the electric bill? Tragedy struck a downtown warehouse today... Well, Paul, you see there isn't... - Come on. You know what? We were thinking, like, why should we pay for something we're not even going to get, right? You got fired again. Yeah. So you don't mind fronting us again, right? Just, like, until I get back on my feet, man, I swear to God... It won't be long. Anyone comes in my room, they're dead. You got it, man, you got it. That's what I'm talking about... - It's not my fault. Alone at last. You gonna get that? - I have to... it could be Crowley. On a Friday night? - I paged him. Hello? Billy. Hey. What's wrong? I can't leave right now. I'm kind of in the middle of something. I could see you tomorrow. Um... okay. I'll come and meet you. Hmm hmm. I'll be there in a half hour. Okay. Bye. What now? - He didn't say. But he sounded terrible. - He always sounds terrible. The guy's permanently freaked out. - You know the shit he's been through. Yeah, well, who hasn't? Look, I know you guys are close, and I'm cool with that, even if you have known him since you were, like, five. But you can only expect so much understanding from one mortal. But you're not just any mortal. I won't be long. Julia? Billy? My god, I almost didn't recognize you. What's wrong? - I look bad, huh? Terrible. What happened to your hand? It's... it's hard to explain. - Try. They're here! - Who? Billy, it's just a power surge from the storm. No, it's not. Listen to me... You remember those night terrors that we used to have? What, when we were kids? That's when they marked us. And now they're back. Who? You see that? - What? Listen to me: When you hear a baby crying, or you hear a kid crying you keep moving, okay? Children can sense them. It's your warning. Warning against what? - Also, they affect the electrical things. They affect the lights and the phones. They... they affect things. Billy, stop!! You're not making sense. Just tell me what happened. - What I am telling you. They can't be in the light. They hide in the dark so you can't see them. I mean I've been doing research, and reading and... I don't think I'm alone. Poe... I think he saw them too. His writing's dark, and hopeless. And he went crazy too. I don't know what you're talking about. Well of course you don't. I have to work nights so I can sleep days! My own fucking mother has to look at me like I should be locked up. I even tried to find out if there's other people like us. I made friends, to see if it wasn't just me. And you know what I found out? What? - Nobody can help me. I'm going to help you. - No! You can't. I shouldn't have called you. No, you did the right thing. Just try to explain it to me. I'm scared. I'm scared. There's nothing to be scared of. - You're wrong. Billy. I'm sorry. - Sorry for what? No... Hello? Hello? Hello? Paul? Paul?! Paul? Paul? Julia?! Julia! Julia... Stop! JULIA!!! Julia! Stop! Hey, listen, I'm not going to hurt you! I'm going to stay right here. Honey, listen. Hey... hey... there's nothing to be afraid of. How did I get here? - You must have been sleepwalking. It's nice to see someone else born after 1950. Hey. So, how did you know Billy? - We were friends since we were kids. I'm Julia. Right... yeah... um... Billy talked a lot about you. Um... I'm Sam, this... this is my roommate... Terry. Hi. - Hi. Billy, Sam and I were really close in college. Yeah. You were with him, weren't you? The night that he... - Yeah. I'm sorry. Did he say anything to you? Nothing I could understand. It was all pretty incoherent. Sort of like maybe he was on something again. You know he was taking Prozac. I guess it didn't work. Excuse me. What? Hey... I just wanted to apologize for Sam's comment back there. The guy engages his mouth before his brain sometimes. It's okay. I'm just a little over-sensitive right now. We all are. So, had you seen much of Billy recently? Yeah, until he moved back here about months ago. Do you know what he was trying to tell us with all this? Maybe he was planning for a really long camping trip. Or that he was afraid of the dark. - I know that feeling. You had night terrors as a kid, right? Did Billy tell you that? Yeah. For a while that was all he could talk about. In fact, it is the reason that him and Sam and I met. We all had 'em. - What? It's crazy, huh? See, we all got really close freshman year, but it was only later that Billy told us he had sought us out. He was obsessed back then. - And what about lately? He'd come to me, recently, a few times, babbling about how we shared the same problem, how we need to stay in the light. I guess I should've taken him more seriously, but I was so used to Billy acting crazy, you know? It never occurred to me that the same thing could happen to us. You are the string days collected like tiny silk beads and counted before sleeping. Julia! Hey, baby... Welcome home... Are you drunk? - I prefer intoxicated. Come on, I'm just having a couple of drinks. What's with all the hostility? I had an accident. - What? On the way home. I had an accident. - Are you hurt? No. Okay. Tell me what happened. I was driving out in the middle of nowhere and... I thought something ran out in front of me, so I had to slam on the brakes and I nearly went off the road. Did you hit the 'something'? I don't know. I don't think so. I thought I saw what... I'm just not... exactly sure what happened. Okay, well, was it an animal? I don't think so. - Okay, so what'd you hit, an alien? I should have known... I should have known! Oh, hey... No, I should have known that you would make fun of me. Well, what do you want me to say!! - I don't know. I just know that something scared me. I've got my defense the day after tomorrow. I just don't need to come home and find you getting wasted with your idiot roommates!! Look, let me tell you what I've been up to. There was a thirteen car pile-up on the last night. So for the past hours I've been cutting dead people out of their cars. There's a difference between what you've been through and what I've been through. Yours is in there... Mine's out here. Don't get confused about which is which. Billy must have been writing in this diary since childhood, so we thought you might want to take a look at it. Maybe you can make more sense out of it than we could. It's pretty deranged stuff. Like this: ""Saw them again, beneath my window, in the alley."" ""Always in darkness and shadow."" ""Where do they come from?"" ""Could it be that darkness is their way in and out?"" ""Origins. Incubus, bringers of nightmares."" ""Grendels lurking in the darkness,"" ""can only assume that light is my savior..."" ""Maybe it's all in my head."" ""The insane nightmare of a schizo."" You don't seem surprised by any of this. It's a lot like the stuff he talked about the night he died. It's not too surprising that he would write about it too. No, I guess not. It's just that... We were wondering if... What? If you've had any recent 'night terrors'? Yeah, actually, I have. Us, too. Ever since Billy killed himself, I've had this uneasy feeling. You know, like I'm being watched or something. I mean, I'm years old, and I walk in a dark room and it's like I'm again... C'mon, you guys. We've all been through an extremely traumatic experience. It's only natural that certain uncomfortable feelings would be stirred up... You don't remember. Remember what? How powerful those feelings were. - What do you mean? When I was five, I watched my sister drown in a lake where we used to spend our summers. Right after, I started to suffer from terrible night terrors. There was one particularly bad night. I woke up screaming my head off. My parents finally managed to get me to sleep, and a couple of hours later, my mother came back to check on me and I was gone. They looked everywhere: In the attic. In the basement. All over the house. My mother was hysterical, she thought I'd been kidnapped, or I'd run off, or who knows what. Then my father went into the backyard and he heard a noise in the doghouse, of all places. He stooped down, looked in, and there I was, huddled in the back. Naturally, he reached in. And... that's when I stabbed him in the eye with a kitchen knife. I was convinced he wasn't my father. That he was some kind of demon coming for me. I was absolutely sure of it. I haven't had that feeling since I was a kid, but I have it now... and so does Sam, and... we thought you might, too. Julia? Yes, Dr. Booth. - I hardly recognize you! In fact, I don't recognize you at all, but come on in. It's hard to think of you as that frightened little girl who used to come in here. My god, it's been what... Twenty years. Twenty years. It's a wonder I'm still around. So, what have you been doing with yourself? Well actually, I'm going for my masters in psychology. Psychology?! That's wonderful! Now, tell me, outside of studying, how are you doing? I'm not doing that well, Dr. Booth. That's why I came to see you. I haven't been sleeping that well... I think I had a recurrence. A recurrence? Of what? - Night terrors. What makes you say that? A few nights ago, I woke up in my bathroom... totally disoriented. My boyfriend came to help me and I attacked him. Well, it certainly sounds like a night terror. It's not unheard of in adults... But really quite abnormal. Yes, that's right. Night terrors can be part of normal childhood development. But I've found that the most violent and persistent cases occur in children who've suffered profound emotional trauma. If I recall, you came to see me shortly after your father took his own life, isn't that right? Yes. So, your recent night terror could possibly have been triggered by an increase in stress or fatigue. Am I far off? No. No. Julia, why don't we schedule a formal session. I don't usually treat adults, but since we have a history, you could come in here, describe the things you're going through, and we'll try to figure out if it really is a recurrence of night terrors or if it's... something else. You scared the hell out of me. Sorry... What do you think went through Billy's mind when he did it? The bullet. I don't know, Terry, the same thing that goes through everybody's mind before they kill themselves: That they hate their life; they're better off dead than alive. Blam! Blam! Blam! I wonder what it's like to get to that place. Terry, stop picking it or it's never going to heal, okay? It's not healing anyway. I might as well get some satisfaction. I think it's getting worse. - Maybe it's cancer. There is something seriously demented about you, do you know that? You know, maybe I should've gone to law school. Like I said... demented. Look, I'm going to go out, try to detox for a little bit. Are you going to be alright by yourself? Yeah. Sure? Yeah. Okay. Bye. Got you! Damn rats. Understanding your Child's Dreams Hello? - Hey, Julia. How goes it? Lousy. I'm still on chapter four in Crowley, and I can't remember half the other sources in my bibliography. Well, look at the bright side. If you flunk, it's only another months of hell and another grand. But it could be worse. - How? Im not sure exactly. Hey, listen Kim, will you call me later? Make sure I'm still awake. Okay, bye. - Thanks. Bye. STATE MENTAL HEALTH ASSOCIATION ...experiencing emotional difficulty... ...paranoid delusion... ...subject claims demon... Could somebody turn the lights back on, please? Hello? Open the door! Please, somebody help me!! Damn it! Moore's Theory of Discordance postulates that subjects, when presented with evidence hostile to their world view, experience disassociative discordance or fight or flight reflexivity. And discordance here is defined... as... delusions of reality stemming from childhood trauma and... a heightened state of anxiety... Yes. Sorry. By increasing the number of familiar external stimuli individuals will... ...well, individuals will try... ...individuals experiencing discordance will... Would you please excuse me? - Yeah. Certainly. Hey, it's Julia. Leave a message after the beep. Julia, come on, pick up. I know youre there. Im sorry about the other night. So consider this the official apology. Besides, I want to hear how your defense went. I bet you knocked 'em dead, but I need specifics, so pick up the phone. Alright, I can take a hint. But Im gonna harass you until you call me back. Hey, it's Julia. Leave a message after the beep. Paul... Hello? Julia. This is Sam. Oh, hi. I need to talk to you. Hello? - Hey, it's Julia. Yeah, come on in. Okay. Hello? Sam? Depressing, isn't it? Look, I'm sorry that I called you. I just figured that you'd be the only one that would understand. Understand what? - I mean, you see it, right? I don't know what I see. - But you can feel it. You definitely feel that something bad is happening, right? Yes. You see, you do understand. Terry's missing. What do you mean, 'missing'? She didn't come home last night. The rec center called me this morning. And they said that they found her bag with all of her stuff in it. Sam, slow down. Maybe... Maybe she just forgot her stuff in her locker. And what, left the building in her bathing suit? Did you call the police? Yes, I did. They're not going to find anything. I've been studying Billy's diary ever since we found it. You know, I can't seem to do much of anything else. It's like... Sam... No, wait, wait. Just listen. Okay, now I can't make sense of all of it, but... I was taken to their world when I was five and marked, but it faded. They only mark kids who have night terrors. Listen to this... ""Last week the mark reappeared."" ""It means they're coming for me."" Just listen to his last entry, okay? ""I can't write much longer,"" ""the mark on my hand keeps getting worse."" ""I can't stand it."" ""I pulled out this thing they planted in me."" Sam, Billy was unstable, we know that. No... This is ridiculous... he'd had problems since he was a kid. We all did. Now, don't you think it's possible... that something that scared us as kids has come back... to collect us? What are you saying? I never saw Billy's mark, but I did see Terry's... and hers looked a lot like this... Hi. Hi. What's your name? Sarah. My name is Julia. Are you all by yourself? Where's your mom? Heaven. Do you work here? No. I don't either. I'm a patient. Sarah... do you have bad dreams? Sometimes. What happens in your dreams? They come for me. Who comes? They. Why do they come for you? To eat me. Does anything keep them away? Lights. You think I'm crazy? No. Why don't you tell me what you think it all might mean. Our night terrors may not have been induced by emotional trauma at all. Maybe something really did come for us when we were kids, and planted something in us. And whatever it was, it left a mark. Just like that little girl's. - And now they're coming back? Yes! And that's why the marks reappear. So that they can find us and take us back to the place in our night terrors... out of the light. I know how it sounds. Julia, you say you failed your thesis defense with Dr. Crowley? Perhaps you'd like to tackle this case? Subject is suffering post-traumatic stress from witnessing the suicide of a close friend. Influenced by the erratic behavior of two strangers, she allows herself to entertain... the paranoid schizophrenic delusions of her dead friend. And why does she do that? Because she feels a sense of personal failure... ...and guilt that Billy... ...that her friend died. And you are going to be an excellent psychologist. I'll see you on Thursday. Thank you, Dr. Booth. Oh, Julia... If these demons were coming back, wouldn't you have the mark too? Remind me what I'm looking for? Like an infected mark-thing. Little, pinkish. Like the size of a dime. Well... nothing yet. But it's early. - Paul, this is serious... Okay. I'm sorry. You're all done. No marks. You sure? Double-checked, trust me. Not that I'm complaining, you know, but why'd you need me to do that? I met these two friends of Billy's at the funeral. And? Well, they both had marks like Billy's. And so I went to tell Dr. Booth, and... Oh, you're just gonna think this is crazy. Julia. Didn't we just search your entire body and find nothing? So, what have you got to worry about? You're right. You're right. Jesus! Somebody! Hey! Over here! Help! Hey! Over here! Come on! Hey, Paulie! We're going down to the... Woah. Hello, nurse. - Get out! Get out! You mad? - Not mad. I'm embarrassed. But I'll get over it. Troy may not, however. I'm sorry about the last couple of days. Hey, you feel. Don't apologize for it. Good night. I'll see you tomorrow. ... and all for less than a dollar. What do you think of that? You cant beat that kind of value. ... as the power shortage reaches critical levels, residents are asked to save energy and turn off the lights in an effort to avoid more rolling blackouts this weekend. And in a related story, officials say the rolling blackouts will have an effect on emergency services provided in the largest metropolitan hospital. This comes as another blow to the already beleaguered medical center as eleventh-hour talks broke down today between doctors and hospital administration. Hospital spokesperson Jason Hildin stated that the doctor's strike is a foregone conclusion. This is getting ridiculous. On the lighter side of civic news... Paul! Paul! Paul! Let me in! I'm coming! My God, what happened to you? Julia, what happened? Look at me. Let me see you. Look at me. Look! Look!! I've got it! Just like Billy and Sam... I've got this thing on me... Jesus, how the hell did you manage that? Ouch!! Be careful! It hurts... Don't move. Don't move. There was... There was this thing... like a... like a big splinter, and I pulled it out of me... ...I pulled it out of me... You pulled what out of you? It was in my head. This thing was in my head! Slow down. Slow down. What was in your head? I don't know... like a kind of a bone... or something... I don't know... they grabbed me in my apartment. In my apartment, they tried to get me... I ran down the street and I... ...I was in this bathroom and... Because of the light. It has something to do with the light. I think that they can't be in the light. Billy wrote it all down... Drink this. ...and electricity!! Which is why the whole blackout thing... They could be everywhere... - Sit. No... everywhere. - Sit down. Okay, take a few deep breaths, okay. You'll be asleep soon. - Asleep?!! I'm not going to go to sleep! Honey, you need to go to sleep. Okay? I can't go to sleep! What did you give me??!! Don't touch me! Get away from me! Listen to me! Nothing's going to happen to you. I will not let anything happen to you. I won't let anything happen to you. Now, sit down. Sit down. I'm going to get you some clean clothes, and then I'm going to take care of everything... okay? Alright? Alright. Everything you're feeling is perfectly understandable considering the week you've had! The best thing you can do is just stay here and get some rest. No! No! Let me out! Somebody! Wait! No! No! Stop! Stop! No! Help! Hey! This really isn't like her. She's just confused. All we can do is to wait, see what happens. Make sure that... Julia! It's okay. It's okay, Julia. It's okay. You're safe now. You're safe. Did you think something was attacking you? They found you in the subway... - With a concussion. You're pretty banged up. Let's get you back into bed. I was trying to get to the red light... Okay, we'll work all that out. But right now you need to rest. Everything's going to be fine. How could she get out of a locked room? That door was bolted. Julia? What is it? Nothing. Nothing. Help! Help me! I'm here! Help me! I'd better go call security. Help me! Hey! I'm here! Help! Are you coming? Wait! I'm here! Nooo! I'm here! I'm here! No!"
67,2001,Head Over Heels,American,"Amanda Pierce (Monica Potter), a New York paintings conservator working at The Met, has very bad judgment in men, which is proven when she walks in on her boyfriend cheating on her with a supermodel. Amanda begins looking for a new apartment and finds one with four struggling models, Jade (Shalom Harlow), Roxana (Ivana Miličević), Candi (Sarah O'Hare), and Holly (Tomiko Fraser).
When Amanda discovers that Jim Winston (Freddie Prinze Jr.), the guy she likes, lives in the apartment across from hers, she starts spying on him to try to find his flaw. One night Amanda sees Jim kill a woman, Megan O'Brien (Tanja Reichert), and by the time the police arrive they don't believe Amanda because she is the only witness, and the evidence is gone.
Annoyed about the police's lack of effort to find out what has really happened, Amanda and her new friends investigate on their own. When Amanda finds out about what she thinks is Jim's involvement with Megan's death, she confronts him. Amanda's judgment turns out to be wrong and Jim, who turns out to be undercover cop, Bob Smoot, who was trying to gain a suspect's trust by staging his partner Megan's death, has his cover blown. Amanda discovers that Jim is investigating Halloran (Jay Brazeau), a Russian man who has been smuggling in money and who Amanda has been privately restoring a painting for.
Later, Jim, Amanda and her roommates get captured, but escape when Roxana seduces their Russian guard, and with the help of the models realize what Halloran was really doing, smuggling diamonds. Amanda, Jim, and the models go to a fashion runway and take down Strukov. They are all awarded special commendations for meritorious service from the FBI.
After the cops take care of things Jim asks Amanda if they can start over, but she refuses and Jim leaves. At the end Amanda and Jim (going by his real name Bob) ""meet"" again and the movie ends when Bob takes Amanda up to his new apartment and shows her the view, which turns out to be of Amanda and the models' apartment. Lisa and the models are jumping around happily while Bob and Amanda laugh. They kiss and close the curtains to his apartment window.",5.4,tt0192111,"This is Grinnell, Iowa, my hometown, Where my family and all of my friends live. But I'm not there now. I'm here. New York City. Home to eight million people, roughly half of whom are men. Which means half of the city is genetically predisposed to lie to the other half. You see, I'm the woman who has the world's worst judgment in men. I know what you're thinking. You might think that you do, but you don't. I do. My grade-school boyfriend, Tommy, left me for... someone with boobs. My high-school boyfriend, Charlie, left me for, Well, someone who didn 't have any boobs. Amanda. This isn't what it looks like. But that's all behind me now. I have a great job restoring paintings at the Metropolitan Museum. I'm in the Renaissance art division, Where the men are easier to deal with. There you are, handsome. So there's this new hottie upstairs in 20th-century sculpture. She is so sweet, and I swear I'm gonna be gettin' all up in there, and I'm gonna be-- Lisa, you are crossing the sharing boundary again. But seriously, we have to put in for transfers. Renaissance is a dead end. We're gonna end up like the menopause triplets there. What? Hmm? I don't think I could ever leave Renaissance. I would miss these paintings way too much. I mean, they're just so romantic and-- - Shit. Here comes old man Rankin. Look busy. - Oh! Rat farts! I am busy. Help me look busy. - Afternoon, ladies. - When will we go to the Poconos again? Amanda, I need your help. Take a look at this piece of crap. Oh, my God, it's-- That's Titian's The Bacchanal. - Oh! - There she goes again. Look at this man's face. It's completely lost. You're gonna have to start from scratch on that. Put aside your other work, Amanda. This is priority number one for now. Oop! What's with you and this weak-in-the-knees routine? You do it every time you get a new painting. I do not. Not every time. I mean, when I look at this painting, I can just tell that these people were in love... and they stayed in love until the day that they died. Amanda, it's a painting. If this were real life, in two years, that girl would be pregnant and that guy would be out banging a barmaid. Maybe that's why I like art better than real life. They can stay in love forever. Speaking of real life, aren't you supposed to have one tonight, for a change? Oh, sh-- That's right. I was gonna surprise Michael with dinner. What's so funny? Nothing. Just that you're going to die alone. - What? - She's going to die alone! Ohh. Seriously, why do I need a personal life if my work makes me happy? Because work isn't enough. You need someone to share your life with. And if you give up on that now, it might not be so easy to find later. Polly, could I see you in my office? I need to have a look at the, uh, restoration reports. Oh, God. Do you think that could be me one day? No. If it got that bad, I'd shoot you... and put you out of your misery. Think I better go see Michael. Michael? Oh, shit. Uh, Amanda, this... isn't what it looks like. Huh. It looks like you're having sex... with a woman from the cover of a lingerie catalog. - In our bed. - Uh-- Amanda, you know what your problem is? Hmm? You think everybody's basically good, and you fall for them right away. There are four million men in New York. Why can't I find one good one? Just one. Just one. You know? Just one. Remember when you saw the Titian and you got weakin the knees? Have you ever felt that way about a guy? Lisa, please. Real women don't get weak in the knees over some guy. Yeah, but most woman don't get weak in the knees over a painting. Well, l-- I understand paintings, and I know what I feel for them is real. Men, they're just-- They're complicated, you know? What I need to do right now is just focus on work and forget about men. I think that's the smartest thing you've said all night. Is this okay? I think I'll start looking for a place this Saturday. Or tomorrow. Hi. I'm going up to apartment 9. Hello? Hamlet, no! - Get it off me! - Get off of her. Come on. Bad dog! Are you okay? I guess he likes you. Huh? Whoa! Hey. I think you might still be a little shaken up. No, no, no. I'm fine. I just got weak... knee-- knees. Oh. You know, you should really learn to control yourself. I mean, control your dog. Oh. He's not my dog. I walk him for my neighbor. She had her hip replaced. ""Not my dog."" Right. That's what you say to avoid a lawsuit-- Come on, Hamlet. No means no, dude! I am so sorry. He's a horny bastard, isn't he? - I wouldn't know. I just met him. - I was talking about the dog. I know. I know that. Can I get you anything, like a Kleenex or a cigarette? No, I'm fine, really. Look, it was nice to meet you and your huge dong-- I mean, his huge dong. I've seen way bigger than that. I mean, his huge dick. Dog! Huge dog! Right. Okay. Gotta go. It was nice meeting you too. Oh! Hamlet. Great Dane. I get it. That's clever for a dog name. Yeah, I thought so too. Oh, my God. I gotta go. Bye. Come on in. Wow. This place is amazing. Holly Payton. Oh, Amanda Pierce. The rent's 500. You can pay cash, check, money order, cash-- Could I see the room first? Ta-da Here it is. Wow. It looks like a closet. Oh! Closets don't have windows. Besides, this... is the closet. Wow. I mean, how much room do you need to sleep? But shoes, they need their space. Now, we have a lot of people interested, so what is it that you do? Oh, I work over-- You work? I like you. Did I mention you're in the lead for the apartment? - Hey. - Oh, you're back. - Ooh! - This is Amanda. She works. Amanda, this is Roxana Miloshslah-- Miloslavzniakova. Hi. - It's nice to meet you. - You know what's nice? Paying the rent, that's what. G'day. I'm Candi. With an ""I."" - Mm. Amanda. - I had a pet dingo named Amanda once. - A pet dingo? - Yeah, but me dad backed over her with a tractor. I was find in' pieces of her all summer-- tops of trees, my little sister's hair-- Thank you, Candi. This is Jade. Oh, God, not the ring. Wow. That's an incredible diamond. You engaged? No, it would take a lot more carats than this. You're not a smokergirl, are you? No. That's how we all got put together. We are the last four non smoking models... on the whole island of Manhattan. Oh, my God. You're all models. Yeah. Oh, don't envy us. We're struggling. - In this apartment? - Our agency lets us stay here for free. We like to rent the extra closet -- room-- for spending money. Ah, yeah. I don't think she likes them, the models. No, my boyfriend just left me for a model. - It's not any of you. - Whew! I'm glad we don't have to go through that one again. Then we'll all get along fine. No problem. Welcome. I love you. That was good English, Dieter. Hmm? Hey, Mandy. You want a blouse? Oh, no. Okay. Phooey. This shirt makes me look like heroin addict. And not in a good way. Here. Take mine. I wore it once before anyway. What are you going to wear? I'll just take hers. - Say what? - She wants to try on your top. Give it. What's going on here? Hey. Did you know there are two guys just waiting in the hall for you? Only two? The longer we wait, the more money they'll spend. On dinner. Okay, let's back it up, boys. See if there's anything you like, Amanda. Oh, no, no. I'm not really interested in men right now. Oh, but they seem like great guys. Yeah, they all seem like great guys when they know you're watching. - You gotta learn to look past what they want you to see. - Huh. That guy right there-- Suit's Hugo Boss, but it's straight off the rack. Tie's a Gucci knockoff, and those shoes-- Girl, that's between him and Payless. But check this guy. See that bulge in hispants? That's either a necklace box from Tiffany's or-- Oh, hell. I'll take him either way. So you pick relationships based on clothing and gifts. No, we pick them based on personality. - Now pick a guy so we can go. - Oh, I don't think I can afford to go out with you guys. Actually, I know that I can't. We don't pay. We're models. What does someone like you do? I'm a paintings conservator at the Met, specializing in Renaissance art. Oh. Right now I'm restoring this one painting-- - Titian's Bacchanal. - Yeah. Uh, and-and one of the faces is blank, and there's absolutely no historical record of what it looked like, so it's up to me to complete it. Yeah, we should definitely talk more about that later. Okay. Hi, Candi with an ""I."" Oh, hi, Mandy. Facial-Flex? Oh, no, I'm-- I'm good, thanks. Wow. You have a really symmetrical nose. Thank you. So why aren't you going out with them? Oh, I can't go out in public yet. The agency made me get an operation. My earlobes were uneven. You know, Candi, some ofthe really great faces aren't necessarily symmetrical. Yeah, the beauty's often in the flaws. You're an odd bird, you know that? Wow. We have quite a view here. Yeah. - No way. It's him. - What? - It's who? - That guy-- Mr. Fish Tank? Oh, his name's Jim Winston. But his head doesn 't normally look that big. - It's the water that makes it look that way. - How do you know? Oh, I know alot about water. Australia's an island, you know. I mean, how do you know his name is Jim Winston? Oh. He's a fashion executive. The girls tell me he's the hottest young guy in the business. So you want him, eh? Why do you say that? That look on your face. I used to see it all the time when I'd catch me Uncle Pete lookin' at me. There's no look. I was just shocked because I recognized someone. Besides, I never go out with guys like that, even if I were going out, which I'm not, so-- - You want me to find out where he works? - No. I just told you, I don't care if I ever see him again. Hamlet! Get off her. It's you. Again. Hamlet definitely seems to like you. You mean, he doesn't just tackle anybody? No. He tackles everybody, but he only drools on his favorites. Well, I'm flattered. You're funny. Whoop! Oh! You really should have somebody take a look at those knees. You know, they've never done this before. I'm gonna have to see a psychiatrist. I mean, a leg doctor, because obviously it's a leg problem. At least let me buy you another latte. Ah, no, thanks, Jim. How do you know my name? I don't remember introducing myself. But you did, Jim. Remember? I'm Amanda and that's Hamlet. Jim, Amanda, Hamlet. I think I'd remember a beautiful name like Amanda. But you didn't. Anyway, sorry. I can't go out with you. For coffee. I didn't mean go out with you, just go out with you for coffee. Not even to replace this one, Which I can't. I got the runs. I mean, I gotta run. Okay, gotta go. Oh, God. I got the runs? So why didn't you have coffee with him? Because that's what I would normally do. What? I'd have coffee with him, I'd move in... and find myself alone on a beach in Waikiki... while he's off with the slut that runs the pearl-diving concession. Oh, yeah, it happened. - Is that the new C.K. girl? - Uh-huh. - She's cute. - You know, I heard they gave her million dollars. She looks 14, though. Hello. She's 12. Question. If these guys are your dates, why do you make them stand over there? Have you ever spent an entire evening with one of these guys? It's all, ""You're beautiful in that dress."" ""You look beautiful in this light."" ""Come marry me and be the queen of my country."" So Holly worked out the ""You sit over there"" system. It works. - You know, she turned down a full ride at Stanford. - Yeah. Really? Why'd you do that? Sweetheart, look at me. What do I need Stanford for? Mm-hmm. - That's 120. I don't-- - It's 1,200. - Twelve hundred dollars? - Relax. Ladies, may I have the honor of taking you to dinner? Thank you. That's so sweet. It's nothing. If you say you're not interested in him, why are you watching him? I'm not. Well, I am, but only to prove to you that he has some huge flaw. How do you know that? Because I'm attracted to him. What a cute little bunny. Look. Okay, there's the flaw. He has a love child. Who's that woman that just walked in? He can't have a love child without a lover. And that scumbag invited me out for coffee. Then how do you explain the husband-looking guy with the baby pouch? A little menage a trois action. Yeah. I bet they don't even know which one the father is. Eww! Ah, schoolgirls. That's sweet. Yeah. Seems sweet. Unfortunately, what we're about to find out is they're underage prostitutes... dressedas Catholic girls. See that? He's giving them money. I think the money's probably for all those candy bars he's buying. Those little whores are good. They even bring the props. Twenty-one! Whoo! Twenty-two! Twenty-three. Twenty-four. Oh, 25! Okay, pace yourself. Twenty-six. Oh-ho. Stop it. Now, I am looking very hard, okay, and I can't see any flaws. He's like Mr. Perfect. A little too perfect, maybe? Gay perfect? He wears boxers, and there are no framed portraits of his mother. Trust me, that man is not gay. I can't decide whether he looks better with clothes on or off. - These are great pictures, Jade. - I know. Let me see, let me see-- Oh. Candi, your eyes-- your whole face is beautiful. - Why do they keep making you get work done? - Bulk discount. Look, Amanda, he's having a party. It's the best time for you to talk to him. Yeah, except that I'm not invited. So what? We crash. That's a really great way to talk to someone-- getting turned away from his party. - Who would keep models away from a party? - Hello. Every man there is gonna be saying, ""I wish more models would show up at this party."" - No, thanks, anyway. - Stop the pose. You know you're into him. I am not. Um, excuse me? Busted. So? He just happens to have a Renaissance structure to his face. Mm-hmm. I mean, what's the point? He's in the fashion business. He probably only dates... you know. - Promiscuous women? - No. Models. Fine. If you think he wants a model, we will give him a model. Oh, no. No! - Make over! - If you change your mind I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free Take a chance on me If you need me, let me know Gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feelin' down If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown Honey, I'm still free take a chance on me Gonna do my very best and it ain 't no lie Can you put me to the test Can you let me try Take a chance on me Take a chance on me I can't wearthis. I look like a skank. You can wear it, honey. I'm just not sure how long you'll keep it on. Remember, when you walk in, you're the most beautiful woman in the room. Well, you're in the top four. True. Oh, and keep your cheeks clenched. Not those. These. Oh, and most important, don't forget to turn them on, the headlights. Okay. Allright. Here comes-- Hey, Jimmy, a piece of heaven fell into my office today, I swear to God. And she signed with you, Nick. When did she get the third eye removed? Ladies. Ladies. Ladies, the first glass was free, but this one is gonna cost ya. My God. Hey, Ivan. Harold. Hey, Jimmy, just got some new samples in. You wanna open 'em now or later? I will take her now... and her later. -  Barks  - Women Giggling Bernie! - Megan! Just because we work together doesn't mean We can't, you know-- - I mean, why do you have to act all-- - Excuse me. Hey,Jade? I'll see you. Yeah? - Where are you going? - I think I was wrong about Jim. I'm out. So, what was that you were saying about me? Hold it! Wait! - Amanda? - Jim! - Ah! Ah! - OW! Guh! Oh, hi. I didn't recognize you without your big, drooling dog. I barely recognize you. Yeah, I live with models. I was their science project tonight. So, you're a model. Oh, yeah. Supermodel. I meant to say that I hope you're not a model. You're not like most of the women I see at these parties. What is it you do? I restore paintings at the Met. - Really? - Yeah. That's why I'm leaving. I wish I could leave. - Why? You seemed like you were having a great time. - Oh-- Well, my job basically consists of kissing ass and smiling while I do it. - Ah. - But that's not really me. So the split personality emerges. You're really two different people. You could look at it that way. We'd, uh, both like to talk to you. Well, I don't want to keep you two from your party, so-- Hey, as far as we're concerned, you are the party. Allright! Ha-ha! But why did she leave you? I mean, you're practically perfect. I mean, it sounds like you two were a great couple. You know what my problem is? I think everybody's basically good. Then I fall for them right away. And then I get disappointed. Hmm. I know exactly what you mean. Not saying that I was ever the best boyfriend. Work kept me away for long hours. She thought it was dangerous. She thought the fashion business was dangerous? Dangerous. To my health. You know, stressful. Well, I'd hate to see anything happen to you, and I onlyjust met you. Thereyou are. Jim. Come back to the party, man. There's somebody I Want you to meet. Great. Was the chairman able to make it? Oh, no, not the chairman. Just some V.I.P.s in from Antwerp. Okay, okay. Hold on a second. Remember that ass I hate kissing? Well, this is Belgian ass. The worst. Well, I wouldn't know, but I'll take your word for it. Hey, maybe we could meet on purpose next time. A date? Yeah. You know, actually, my schedule's pretty crazy the next few weeks. Uh-- Yeah, me too. I have this big project at the museum. And Mr. Rankin-- Goodnight, Jim. Good night. - Amanda. - Huh? - My jacket. - Oh. Thanks. Jim, come on. Forget about that one. This party's swarming with 'em. Come on. Amanda! I... wanna... go out with you. - Asthma? - Only when I'm under stress. Look, I usually hide in my work-- I mean, behind my work. So I don't hurt anyone. I mean, get hurt. I think we're both alike. You mean, inarticulate? Yeah. That's the word I was looking for. - What are you doing Saturday? - Huh? Whoa! I thought I told you to get those knees looked at. And you know What? What? He likes me without the dress and the makeup and the stiletto heels. Oh, Mandy, maybe the next one will work out for you. Mmm, there's not gonna be a next one. He is the one. Oh! Oops! Thudding There you are! We thought you got a room. You guys looked so cute together. Guess what. What? - He totally kissed me. - Oh! - You go, girl! - You are in love with him. Oh! Who's that? - Oh, it's-- - Another woman. Maybe they're just good friends. Then why is he closing the blinds? He nevercloses the blinds. - Maybe she's his sister. - We are not in the outback, Candi. We are so sorry. Our creep radar didn 't go off with him at all. It's okay. I haven't been able to believe my eyes or my heart. - Why should my knees be any different, right? - You know what? Forget him. - Why don't you come out with us? - No, no, no. You guys go ahead. - You sure? - Uh-huh. I'm totally fine. Okay. Oh, Mandy, I can't see you, but I know you must be sad. My God.  Woman Screams  - Oh, my God! - Did someone scream? Temporary blindness has improved my hearing. You guys, get out here. What? Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. - What's happening? - Are they having sex? - I think he killed her. - How do you mean, ""killed""? Killed, as in dead. Well, Where's the body? Huh? She's gone. She was lying right there. Where are you going? You're calling him? Yeah, I wanna make sure he didn't hurt himself while he was killing the blonde. - That's so sweet. - I'm calling the police. Hi. Um, I'd like to report a murder. I'll hold. How many screams did you hear? Just one. It's right here? It's right here. And so you turned around and, poof, the body just disappears? I didn't say ""poof"", I believe I said ""bam."" And bam, the body's gone. I'm sure it is. Hello, Officer. What's happening? Okay. So, what exactly did this Winston guy do? Well, there were the Catholic schoolgirls-- What did he do with the schoolgirls? He was buying candy bars. But that's not-- - Were the schoolgirls witnesses or accomplices? - Well, I don't know, but Mr. Perfect sure did spend a lot of money. Who's Mr. Perfect? We call him Mr. Perfect... - because of the old lady, the big dog and the love child. - The love child? Look, forget about the love child. I will tell you exactly what I saw-- We saw him lifting. The body didn't disappear? You saw him lift it? No! We saw him lift himself up and down, up and down. Yeah, he gets very sweaty. - Okay, so you didn't see him lift the body? - Like I told you before-- - We were in middle of wardrobe change. - Was anybody else in the room? I was in the room, yes. Okay. I think I've heard as much as I need. Look, I don't think you're taking this very seriously. Hey, to be honest, I don't believe any of this. Bunch of bored models sitting around sniffing a little nailpolish, and then suddenly, bam, you think you see something. Don't get all hysterical. I'm stillgonna investigate it. It is myjob. Nobody pays me 1,000 a day to sit on my duff looking pretty. Big surprise, Sparky. You know, a serious crime has been committed, and all you're doing is insulting me andmy friends. I want your badge number. Here it is. That's if you can count this high. Let's go. Good evening, ladies. Bye. DoorOpens - Hey. - You guys just getting home? It's 7:00 in the morning. - Yeah. The team had to fly to Atlanta. - Yeah. - So I guess Jim didn't do it. - Why do you say that? Is it in the paper? No. He's standing right there in his apartment. What the-- No, I will not ""buzz off"" until you tell me why Winston is still in his apartment. Is he out on bail? Do murderers usually get bail? No, sometimes we just release 'em for fun. Look, no body, no crime. Then how do you explain what I saw? The woman, Megan O'Brien? She tripped over a rug. When you turned your back, Mr. Winston picked her up. - So he's not a killer. - Actually, he seems like a great guy. And this Megan woman, she's okay? - I guess. What do you mean you guess? It's a yes-or-no question. Look, we haven't talked to her yet. She's out of town. We'll track her down. When you talk to her, can you call me immediately? This is very important to me. Sure, Ms. Pierce. I'll put your number in the precinct speed dial right now. Laughing Jackass. Mmm? Not one step further. This place is filthy. - Hey. - Oh, Amanda, I was talking to my shrink this morning, and she said that you were projecting. What you thought you saw Jim do through the window... was actually your own desire to kill all your ex-boyfriends. Why are you talking to your therapist about me? She says I talk way too much about myself. Amanda, we came down here because we decided you should keep your date with Jim. He's too cute to be a killer. And you said the cops don't have anything on him, so-- Look, you guys, I appreciate the effort. Really, I do. But guess what. I am not going out with Mr. Psycho Killer, so go home. - Please don't make them go home. - Amanda, seriously. - You really don't know what happened. - That is not true. - You guys didn't see what I saw. - And you didn't see what we saw... - when you were on the stairs with him. - And what was that? - That you're crazy sick in love. - That is not true. I am 100 over him. Yeah. That's why you spent the whole morning staring at that drawing of his face. So? Big deal. He has a good face. And yeah, maybe there's some mysterious yet valid explanation for what I saw. But why should I go out with him when he's shaping up to be a bigger liar than the rest? So What? All men lie. We know that. Exactly. If you don't like what the police aren't doing, start your own investigation. - What are you-- - That way you can find out if he's nice or a slasher. Or if he's lying about being married. Don King fooled me on that one-- twice. Look! I don't care about him! Amanda, ifyou don't sort this out, you'll never have a good relationship for the rest of your life. You'll end up a pathetic, lonely old woman... who makes her co-workers watch videos of her cat's lame-ass birthday parties. You say what you want about me, tramp, but don't you go bad-mouthing Jane-cat! Enough! Everyone shut up and listen to me! All of you, young and old, gay and straight. I'm a-gonna have red beans for dinner! - And especially the deaf! - Hmm? I don't care about him. I don't care about the baby-sitting or his eyes... or the fact that he can do a zillion ""pully-uppy"" things on that bar. And I don't care about his sexy grin... or the fact that he can make me laugh even when his dog is trying to hump me. And I really don't care... that I fall asleep every night dreaming about him. Because I am not crazy! I saw him kill that girl, and I know it. Sobbing I'm a-gonna have red beans for dinner. - Gladys! - What? I only caught about every fifth word, but that girl is head over heels. - I am not! Look, fine. I will investigate him. I will stalk his ass just to prove there is something seriously off with this guy... and all of you are just too stupid to see it. Can I help you? We were in apartment last night, and we want to be... discreet, you understand? We left some clothes. She means to say our... black, French-cut crotchless panties. And the rest of the props from our act. So you will help us, no? Sure. I'll trade you his key for that dress. Whoo! Mitch, you are a nasty boy! Look, don't blame me. I didn 't break the elevator. Mandy!  Gasping  Sorry. What exactly are we looking for? Evidence. Anything that may indicate he's a cold-blooded killer. Look. It's him with his grandparents. That is very cute. Look at him. Hello. Hi. Girl who has a date with a potential murderer in four days. Could we get back to work, please? Jim might be home any minute. Relax. We called his office. He's gonna be in a meeting all day. Yeah, and Holly's waiting for a phone call, so she's keeping lookout. Yeah, I'm 17. Uh-huh. Year I was born? - Look at this. - What is it? Dirty laundry. He's got a whole pile just sitting on a chair in his bedroom. - So? - I hate that. Look. It has a blood stain on it. That's why I brought it out. He didn't presoak. That baby's set for life. This is going into evidence. Oh, yeah, good. Now make love to the shirt. Good! Love the shirt. Make love to the shirt. Now hate it. It hates you. - Bad shirt! There's a yellow stain right next to it. It's probably-- It's ketchup. That's amazing. She's a bleedin' Sherlock Holmes. Amanda, If you find 20-dollar bill on the floor of somebody else's apartment, is that the same as finding it on the street? - No. - Then I haven't found anything. Oh, yes, you have. Where did you find that? It's a box of knives. - Not just knives. Daggers. - Yeah. Cheese daggers. This gouda's not bad.  Gasps  Oh, shit! Where the hell are they? Hey, hey, hey! What do I do? What do I do? Oh, God! - What are you all doing? - This is where she fell. - Couldn't the police be right? What the hell was that? A kiwi! Oh! What is she doing? Charades? I love charades. Okay. Sounds like-- No. No props in charades. No props and no clothes. Uncle Pete's rules. EW! Okay, Candi. No more stories from the dark farm. Pretty please? Hey. What? Jim's in the hallway? - Everybody, hide! I was here first. You shh! Shh! - Shut up! Vince, it's me. Yeah. Yeah, the breakfast meeting went well. I had to eat more of those damn pierogies, but I should get a meeting with the chairman soon. Okay. Perfect. No. Don't go in there. Don't go in there! Oh! ToiletSeat Lifts Fly Unzips Groans TurdPlops Farting, Turds Plopping Groaning, Sighing LooseStools Splashing Farting, Splashing Sounds What's going on in there? Farting, Splashing, Plopping Continue Farting, Groaning WaterRunning, FaucetSqueaking  Gasping, Gagging, Coughing   Sighs, Chuckles  Let me just say, if he hadn't have washed his hands, this investigation would be over right here.  Deep lnhaling  So, he sounds pretty damn normal. Yeah. Nothing really shouts out ""psycho killer,"" but I still feel like I'm missing something. - Ah! Hey. Sorry. Hope I didn 't scare you. - How'd you get in here? - Oh, I mentioned your name. The guard let me in. Ah. Oh, so you're Jim. - The Jim. - Nice to know I've been talked about. You have no idea. This is my friend, Lisa. She has a black belt in karate. Hey-hey-hey. Me too. Ohhh. I'm sorry for barging in, but I couldn't wait all the way until saturday to see you. Hey, is this Titian? Yeah. You know Titian? Literally the only thing I remember from art history. Hey, do you wanna go grab a drink? Uh, I can't. I'm not comfortable with you-- I mean, leaving with you-- I mean leaving without finishing this here. I understand. I'll let you get back to it. I'm sorry if I scared you, but it's just me, not some psycho killer. For you. Hey, just curious. Did the police ever contact that woman or find her body? Thanks a lot. You couldn't just let me enjoy that for a second, could you? Maybe you better keep investigating. Been runnin' so long I've nearly lost all track of time In every direction I couldn't see the warnin' signs I must be losin' it Cause my mind plays tricks on me It looked so easy But you know looks sometimes deceive Been runnin'so fast Right from the starting line No more connections I don't need any more advice One hand's just reachin' out And one 's just hangin 'on It seems my weaknesses Just keep goin' strong Head over heels where should I go Can't stop myself Out of control Head over heels No time to think Looks like the whole world's out of sync That Winston. I swear the women just flock after him. Is that her? The short one? I thinkso. Last time I saw her, she was all dolled up. Well, we better check her out, make sure we don't have another Megan O'Brien on our hands. - For your collection. - Oh. I have just the shoes for this. - What do you want? - Does he rent a storage space? Ugh. This better be important. It's me. - Guess what. I found it. - Found what? The body. Jim kept it in a duffel bag in his storage space-- the only place we didn't search. In a duffel bag? Where are you now? Central Park, a perfect place to bury a body. I mean, who comes hereafter dark besides murderers? Oh, Wait, Wait. He stopped. Go, go, go, go, go. Go past, go past. Stop up there. Whose cottage cheese is this? Shh! Hold on a second. Thank you. Keep the change. Allright, I'm following him into the woods. Do you think that maybe one of us should hang up and call the police? Don't hang up on me. This is it. He's put it down. Oh, my God, he just pulled out a shovel. He's gonna bury it right here. Oh, my God! Wait. Maybe it's not a shovel. - Well, what is it? - It's-- - It's a baseball bat. - Run! Oh. For a Little League team. He coaches a Little League team. That is so sweet. Isn't that sweet? Hello? Hello? Amanda, please tell us you're gonna stop investigating him now? Only long enough to go out with him. Oh, is this the-- Okay, kind sir. I don't mean to be discriminatory, but there is an age limit to get on the waiting list. Oh. No, no, no. Uh, uh, pardon me. My name is Halloran. I'm here to see Ms. Amanda Pierce about some work. We spoke on the phone. Wow. It's very unusual. Russian, turn-of-the-century? Well, I'm impressed. You know your stuff. What are these... holes? - I think mice. - Oh. Very neat mice. Oop. Excuse us. I booked my first big runway show tomorrow. Great! Oh. Huh. Nice view. Yeah, if you're into that sort of thing. We usually keep the blinds closed. Big Jim! How's it goin'? Uh, Bernie. Hey, listen. Whatever happened to Megan? It's like she disappeared. Megan? Megan O'Brien. You know, the blonde? It's weird. Nobody's seen her since your party. - What the hell happened to her? - You know, I don't-- I don't know if I, uh-- I think she went on vacation. Vacation? During fashion week? That's crazy! It's good to see you, Bern. Anything look good for dessert? Mmm. Everything. - We'll have everything. - Very good, sir. - What? Are you kidding? - No. I'm not in a rush. Are you? No! This is awesome. Do you realize that every time you took a bite of something good at dinner, you made a little sound? Like, mmm. No, no. I did? Oh, God. It's like a cat purring, or-- I just-- I like it, that's all. Okay, they made it to the dessert course without any bloodshed. Can we go to party now? Yeah, let's hurry. I'm getting hives just from being around all these ugly people. - EWW. - Guys, get serious. I told you I think he killed that Megan girl. We never should have pushed Amanda to go out with him. The fashion world is complicated. It's all about the next thing. Everybody's running around all crazy, looking for some new idea, but they're too frantic to actually experience it. That's not what I want. Well, what do you want? To know a good thing when I find it. Like tonight, and the way you look. You make me feel-- I just wish I could freeze this moment and hold onto it, you know? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Let's get outta here. What? What about dessert? Yeah. Uh, sorry. Do me a favor. Meet me outside, okay? Okay. Oh, no! They're coming at us! Amanda will freak if she sees us. It's Jim. Again! Oh, God, please. Please, just let him pee. Did you lock the door? Yeah. We only got a few minutes. Whip that bad boy out. Here you go. That is huge. All right, I'm gonna stick it in now. Sweet. Ah! Ah, man, careful! Don't worry. I've stuffed it in to tighter holes than this! No, I'm out with her right now. Fine. Fine! They want a body, I'll give 'em a goddamn body. Jeez! YoW! What are you doing? It's gonna blow, man! Get out! That can't be good. Shit! Okay, don't move. Uh, hey, hey, Jim? What's going on here? Where are we exactly? Hmm? Allright. You can open 'em up now. Well, I light the sun And the darkness will turn into light Jim, how did you-- I know some people. I used to clean the aquariums here when I was a kid. They're amazing. Yeah, they're beluga whales. - That's, um, Ben, - Uh-huh. and that's Betty. That's Ben's second wife. Oh. Whenever I get stressed out, I come here, watch these guys, try to be more like them. Mr. Fish Tank. What? Mr. Fish Tank. That's what Candi-- Now I see the world That's what I'm gonna start calling you. For the first time Cause I'll light the sun And the darkness will turn into light Now I see the world For the first time For the first time Butterfly flies and a bird doesn't swim You told me you'd get-- Wait. This might not seem like the most guy-like thing to say, but do you think we're moving too fast? I mean, you hardly know me. Oh, I feel like I know you all too well. Somehow, already. You're right. I've wanted to do this ever since Hamlet first drooled on you. Me too. Do you believe in love at first sight? At first sight? It's too easy. I believe in taking a deeper look. So I keep waiting and waiting and waiting Hey. How ya doin'? Ahh! No! Watch it, stinky! You smell like poop. - Do you think we should tell Amanda? - I don't know! Ugh! It's probably nothing. - We should probably say something. - Yeah, but... I don't want to be the one that ruins their relationship. Which seems to be going very well. They're really clicking sexually. - How do you know? - She forgot to pull down the blinds! Ooh! Uh! Okay. I'm starting a new religion. It's called ""Amanda-ism,"" and basically it's me worshipping you. Well then, it's time for a little confession. You have to start telling me a little bit more about yourself. Like what? Anything. Just tell me all your secrets. Well, I'm not really a secrets kind of guy. Come on! - Everybody has some secrets. - Well... there is one fact I've been hiding from you. Mmm. Mmm. I happen to be a master... of daggers. What is he doing? Jade, I think you were wrong about those cheese knives. - A master of daggers? - Oh, yes. You know, I wasjust teasing. Oh, my God. I should have never let her go overthere tonight. - Now I know your secret. - What? - Now I know your secret. - What? You throw like a girl. Whoa! Oh, man! I forgot to close the blinds. Darling, after that performance, I want to be your friend. Yeah. Hey, how'd you do that thing with your back? Okay. I can get really freaked out about this, but guess what. Jim is taking me to Shelter Island for the weekend, and he says he has something important he wants to tell me. Congratulations. You bag him. AWW. I know, I know. I don't wanna get too excited, but we're leaving early, so I gotta get to work. - Wow, that was fast. - Okay, if they get married, I'll throw a shower. - I'll do the pictures. - I do groomsmen. Hold on. He's taking her away? Maybe permanently away? Oh. Hey, Roxana, could I borrow that Richard Tyler thing again? I don't know. I give to you, I may never see again. Come on. Fine. Take it away. Thanks. Wait. Did I miss something here? At yesterday's show, I heard some guy... ask Jim about that woman who disappeared, and-- And you were worried about me. Well, yeah. Hey, you guys. Thought we could walk to work together. Lisa, I only live a block from the museum. Thought you could use the company. Look, Holly, please. Don't be worried. It's okay. I have followed him, I have searched his apartment, and now that I know him intimately-- Darling, you left the blinds up. We all know him intimately. Believe me, Amanda, We really want it to work out between you and Jim. I mean, if it could work out for you guys after all this-- Yeah, I mean, now we're all beachfront property in the Hamptons, but in a few years, we're gonna be condos in Jersey. I am gonna want a real relationship before that happens-- preferably with a four-carat ring, D-flawless. - Oh, that is so sweet. - Yeah, me too. Only I want A-flawless. Roxy, there is no ""A."" Diamondratings start With ""D."" Ha-ha, you can't fool me. I Want ""A."" Nice work, Amanda. Yes, the face is perfect. Yes, it is. Come over and see it sometime. All right, I will. No. I've been impressed with the way you do business. We very much appreciate how you've handled the little problem with the woman. Oh, that was no problem. I do have a question, though. Antwerp. Yes. How does the money get back here? Don't worry. I'm going to explain everything to you. I have plans to increase your role within the organization. Excellent. Where are we meeting? There's time for just a brief meeting out on the runway at 5:00. Great. Which airport? Uh, which one? What's that? Jim! Mr. Halloran. - Amanda. - What's this? All she did was trip over a rug. Then you helped her up. Why is she dead? What are you talking about? This is the woman I saw in your apartment, the woman I saw killed by you. What? What do you mean, ""saw""? My apartment overlooks yours, and I can see everything that you do. I know, I know I should have told you, but I didn't. Mr. Halloran knows. Well, wait a minute. How do you know Mr. Halloran? Amanda, oh, my God. We really need to talk. Let's get to the car. We're running late, aren't we? I'm not going anywhere with you. I think we should all have a talk. Aaah! Let go ofme! Follow them! Shh! I was wrong about the girls. They did see something. Let's take care of this. I can't believe this is happening. You're gonna whack me. You're gonna take me to New Jersey and whack me! Stop it, okay? I'm not gonna whack you. Why was Mr. Halloran shooting at me? Because he's not Mr. Halloran. He's Vadim Strukov, a very well-connected Russian criminal. - So what? Are you a cop? - Kind of. ""Kind of""? Let me see your badge! - I don't have one. - Why don't you have a badge? - Because I'm undercover. - Oh, hey, you know what? I'm undercover too.Did you wanna see my badge? Oopsie! I don't have one! Let me out! Will you stop it? What's the matter with you? But I saw you. I saw you murder that woman. - No, you didn't. There was no murder. - Uh-huh. That whole thing was staged for Strukov, who was on a roof across the courtyard watching. What are you talking about? I'm a federal agent. With the F.B.I.? So's Megan. F.B.I.? Yes. Megan's cover got blown, so we staged it as a way for me to prove my loyalty. That picture in the Post? We planted it. Strukov was getting suspicious that no body had turned up. Oh. Well, what do these Russian guys do? Criminals like Strukov make hundreds of millions of illegal dollars. They can't just put it in a bank. They find a young hotshot like me. They give me the money, I buy the dresses from Antwerp. Then they import them back here, and the money's clean. But hundreds of millions of dollars. They must be selling a lot of dresses. But they're not. They sell hardly any. - How do they get their money back? - I was about to find out... before you showed up early and blew my cover. Well, I was only early because I was so excited about going away for the weekend with you. Amanda, I'm sorry. I didn't plan to meet you or to get so involved with you or-- Hold on. I think I'm getting through. Hey. It looks like Halloran is actually Vadim Strukov. He's the chairman. It was under my nose the whole time. He was talking about a meeting on a runway at 5:00, but I don't know which airport. Cover 'em all. Wait. Those were bullet holes in Mr. Halloran's painting. What? What are you talking about? I'm privately restoring a painting for Mr. Halloran. That's how we met. - Oh, my God, it was a Russian painting. - He's been to your apartment? Why, you think my roommates are in danger? Oh, crap. It's 3:00 in the afternoon. Waiting list does not begin for another five hours. Okay, maybe you can jump the list. Stay here. F.B.I.! Freeze! Put your hands on your head. Not you, girls. Him. Hamlet, stay. Hamlet, no! Oh, these handcuffs are too tight. Okay, would somebody friendly please tell me what is going on? - Jim's an undercover F.B.I. agent. - No, he not. Everybody knows he's Jim Winston. Oh, my God. Jim Winston isn't even your real name. I slept with a man, and I don't even know his real name. - Okay, so what's your real name? - It's, uh, Smoot. - Bob Smoot. - ""Bob Smoot."" - Hi. - I'm gonna die handcuffed next to a guy named Bob Smoot? I can't die here. This place is full of ugly dresses. Jim or Bob or whateveryour name is, if ever you're pretending to be in the fashion business again, a little note: except for strippers, women like jewelry on their fingers, not on their tits. Maybe there are a lot of strippers in Antwerp. Antwerp? Nobody makes dresses in Antwerp. The only thing that comes from Antwerp is diamonds. Good ones. What are you doing? Stop it. Stop it! That's disgusting! Stop it! Smoot is kinky. If that was a rhinestone, I would have been able to crush it instead of chipping my tooth. Huh? The dresses. I was so obsessed about tracking the money, I forgot about the dresses. Antwerp-- Russia. They were never laundering money. They were smuggling diamonds. But you can go to Tiffany's and have a fat businessman buy you all the diamonds you want. Yeah, but not Russian diamonds. Is illegal to take diamonds out of country. Oh, Holly, you borrowed my panties again. Diamonds? That's why Strukov never let me take one for girlfriend. Or wife. Bastard! Harold, I'll make a deal with you right now. Get us out of here and turn state's evidence, I guarantee they'll go easy on you. Think about it, Harold. Federal witness protection program. We're booking people into Hawaii right now. Tsk, tsk. Harold. Da. OW! Whoa. At least he wasn't lying about that black belt. What are you doing? It's evidence. What are you doing? Tennis bracelet. You see? The diamonds are replaced by cheap zirconiums... before they go to the shipping floor. So everything we've been through together has been a lie. No, not everything. Just the little things. Like your name, your job, the fact that all of your ex's are in the witness protection program? The limo! Get in the limo! Excuse me. Who the hell are you people? Hey, hey! This is my limo! My limo! Ladies! OW! - Stay down! - Don't worry. I got the limo at the Jackie auction. - It's totally bulletproof. - Mr. Alfredo? Oh, my God. I'm Candi, and let me just say, it's such an honor to meet you. Oh, thank you, dear, but don't tease. It's bad enough that half my models canceled on me with the flu. What am I supposed to do for my 5:00 runway show? Who's that? It's Alfredo. Everybody knows Alfredo does the hottest runway. Yeah. - RunWay? - What? What is it? -Jesus! - So, Alfredo, do you need models? Well, what the hell have I been saying? Well, what the hell do we look like? - Vince, it's Jim. Look, I don't think-- - Models with attitude. It couldbe a fashion show runway. I like it. You're hired. All of you. Yea! Hey, we're still being chased by those Russian guys. We lost those losers ages ago, and your hanging with the Jim-man just got us a good gig. I know I screwed up. No, I had him, but lost him. Look, Amanda showed up early and blew my cover. No, I didn't tell her Who I-- Of course I lied to her. Look, no-- Look, I'm pulling up to the tent right now. If he's at this show, I could bust him. Trust me. Hurry up. We're here. Marvelous. All right. You guys make your way through the crowd and get movin'. Look, I have to find Strukov, but I am personally making sure that you get out of here. Aw, gee, thanks, Jim, but you do what's important to you. I'll be fine on my own. Oh, thank God. Allright. This is the last one. Make her beautiful. Oh, no, but I'm not a model. No! Let's get cracking, huh? Forget about the stupid models. Just get Winston and the Amanda girl and get them out of here. And for Christ's sake, be discreet. Don't attract attention. I look like Stevie Nicks! Ohh-- Hey, hey! Where you going? Holly! - I Wish I was a stranger who wanders down the sky - OW! I wish I was a starship in silence flying by I wish I was a princess with armies at her hand I wish I was a ruler who'd make them understand I wish I was a writer who sees what's yet unseen I wish I was a prayer expressing what I mean Ooh! Ah! Yeah! Get off me! Will you get this woman off me? Move your hands! Amanda, trust me. - Oh! - Ah! Leave it to Alfredo to bring a sense of theater back to New York fashion... with his new slam-bang show tonight. I should've guessed that if there was gonna be some sort of fashion fiasco... that you girls would be in the center of it. The only fashion fiasco here is your haircut, Sparky. Yeah, that's really-- Pardon me, Officer. Ladies, I just want you to know that you'll each be issued a special commendation... formeritorious service from the director of the F.B.I. Agent Smoot says there's no way he could have cracked this case without you. So, thank you. That's five separate commendations, if you can count that high. Bye-bye. - Nice Work, Smoot. - Thanks, Megan. All right. - Can I talk to you? - Yeah. I owe you an apology. I, uh-- This is not the best place for this, but, uh, Listen. I'm sorry I lied to you, but I'm not sorry I met you. Not at all. So, I was hoping that you could forgive me... and maybe we could start over. What do you think? Uh, I don't know, you know. I just, um-- I just ended this relationship with some guy named Jim... because he wasn't honest with me from the beginning. I'm not really sure I'm ready to start a new one with who ever you are. Let's go, Smoot. We're gonna be filling out paperwork for the rest of our lives. I know what you're thinking, and this time you're right. I screwed up. By the time I realized it, he was already gone, and now I can't find the one guy I ever really cared about. - Mandy! - Did you miss us? Hey, how was Palm Springs? Oh, we just had the best time at that Dinah Shore tourney. Oh, you finished. - It's magnificent. - Yeah. Well, at least he was good for something. Have you talked to him? No, his phone was disconnected when he moved. Not that I tried calling him or anything. He moved? Yeah. It only took two movers five hours to pack and move everything. Not that I was watching. It's like he was never really there. Yeah. You know, I kind of don't want this reminder for all of eternity. I'm thinking of rubbing him out. Oh, yeah, I agree. Think you better rub him out. Hmm? Amanda, admit it. You're not ready to give up on him. Why does he only have one eye? That's 'cause you're looking at the side of his face. He's in profile. Well, it makes him look like a fish. I know a lot about water, you know? Mr. Fish Tank. Jim? Hamlet! Hi. Hi. I just moved into the neighborhood. Oh. Where? A building that faces this one. It's got a great view. Sounds nice, I think. You Wanna come up and see it? Oh. I don't know. We've just met. I'm Bob Smoot. Amanda Pierce. You know, I've gotta be honest with you, Bob-- I know. Smoot is a very strange-sounding name. It's good to be honest from the get-go. - So, what's your line of work, Bob? - That's funny you should ask. I just got promoted to a nice, boring deskjob with the F.B.I. That's funny. You look a lot like this guy I used to know. Good guy? Great guy, but he's not as cute as you. Come on. Come here. Come over here. Wo"
68,2011,The Way,American,"Dr. Thomas Avery (Martin Sheen) is an American ophthalmologist who goes to France following the death of his adult son, Daniel (Emilio Estevez), killed in the Pyrenees during a storm while walking the Camino de Santiago (the Way of St. James), a Catholic pilgrimage route to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, Spain. Tom's purpose is initially to retrieve his son's body. However, in a combination of grief and homage to his son, Tom decides to walk the ancient spiritual trail where his son died, taking Daniel's ashes with him.
While walking the Camino, Tom meets others from around the world, all looking for greater meaning in their lives. He reluctantly falls in with three other pilgrims in particular. Joost (Yorick van Wageningen) is an overweight man from Amsterdam who says he is walking the route to lose weight to get ready for his brother's wedding and also that his wife will desire him again. He is a friendly extrovert who is the first to start walking with Tom. Sarah (Deborah Kara Unger) is a Canadian fleeing an abusive husband, who says she is walking the pilgrimage to quit smoking. Jack (James Nesbitt) is an Irish travel writer who when younger had desires to be a great author like William Butler Yeats or James Joyce but never wrote the novel he dreamed of. He is the last to join the quartet and has been suffering from ""writer's block"". As the pilgrims travel the Camino, they occasionally meet and talk with other pilgrims—two Frenchmen, a young Italian and Father Frank, an elderly priest from New York. Tom occasionally sees visions of Daniel alive and smiling among other people.
On the pilgrimage, the group experiences challenges, such as when a young Romani steals Tom's backpack. Although the thief escapes, his father drags him back to Tom to return the pack, with embarrassed apologies and an offer to attend a street party in compensation.
After the group arrives at Santiago de Compostela, Tom is accompanied by the other three members to Muxía. He scatters the remainder of Daniel's ashes at the sea there.
With Daniel's backpack on his back, Tom sets out on another journey.",7.3,tt1441912,"R-E-T-Z-N. And the next set? Z-H-O-T-N-X. X-O-T, F-D-E. And the next set? R-E-D, O-Z-F. Okay. Uh, Eunice. How many of those letters can you actually see and how many have you memorised? I can see all of them, Dr Avery. Eunice... Okay. I memorised the last two, Tom. Only the last two. If I can't get my license renewed... Eunice, you need to wear the lenses I prescribed. Contact lenses don't work for me and glasses give me headaches. Then we'll change the prescription, but you know the DMV's gonna test you again anyway. I've memorised those charts, too. Mrs. Conrad called and cancelled her appointment for tomorrow. Bill Warren wants to know if he can see you before he goes in for work, which means you have to be here at 8:00 a.m. - Okay. - Okay for 8:00? - Yeah. - Oh. Roger called while you were in with a patient. He said if you miss the 2:00 tee time, you pay for the beer. I pay for the beer anyway. And Daniel called and left a message here on the voicemail last night. - What'd he say? - He said he'll call back. He said he's somewhere in France and he sounded good. I mean, how do you not sound good if you're in France, right? Did he leave a number this time? No. Everyone on the planet has a mobile phone except my son. What the hell's the matter with that kid? The world on Daniel's terms. See you. Oh, no! Let me show you how a real doctor does it. Since when is Tom not a real doctor, Rog? The eyes are the most important organ in the body, Roger. - Maybe at your age, Tom. - They're the windows to the soul. Yeah? How the hell would Roger know? He doesn't have one. Looks like malpractice to me, boys. - Don't use your foot wedge, Phil! - I got your foot wedge, Roger. All right, what do we got, about 70? Yeah, plus to the flag. That's what I'm talking about. You like that? - It'll play. - That's good stuff. I'm over there. Yeah, I see. It's about three feet away. You want a ride or what? I'm old and tired. - You're old and lazy. - I don't see you walking this course. It's mine and it can wait. Get... Nice chip. Not bad. Go ahead and putt out. I'll catch up with you. Hello? Yes, hello? I'm sorry. I don't speak French. I am Captain Henri Sebastian of the National Gendarmerie in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in France. - Is something wrong? - Are you the father of Daniel Avery? Yes, I am. I'm sorry to inform you that your son has been killed, sir. What? What do you mean? Daniel? Something happened to Daniel? He was caught in a storm on the Camino de Santiago, monsieur. I don't even know where that is. It's in the French Pyrenees. He was on pilgrimage. Tom? Tommy? Where you going? Tommy? I'm sorry for your loss, Tom. Thanks, Father. I'm going overseas to bring Daniel home. Would you like to pray with me, Tom? What for? All the information for your itinerary is in here. I cancelled all your appointments for next week, so... He wanted to see the world. And he did. You should fly with me. What? - You should fly with me. - Yeah, right. Turn the car around. Pack a bag. Grab your passport. Forget your golf clubs. Come on, a father-son trip. It'll be fun. When you coming back? I don't know. So you don't have a plan. We agreed that if I let you take me to the airport, you wouldn't lecture me about how I'm ruining my life. I lied. You know, most people don't have the luxury of just picking up and leaving it all behind, Daniel. Well, I'm not most people. If I don't have your blessing, that's fine. But don't judge this. Don't judge me. My life here might not seem like much to you, but it's the life I choose. You don't choose a life, Dad. You live one. - Mr. Avery? - Yes. We spoke on the phone. - Captain Henri Sebastian. - Of course. I don't know why, I know it's odd, but I thought it would say something else. It's the same word back home. I guess I thought it would be different. Mr. Avery, if you are not ready to do this, - it can wait. - No. It's fine. I mean, it's not fine. I mean, I'm okay. Let's get it over with. Let's just get it over with. These are Daniel's belongings. This is everything he had when we found him. - What happened? - It was an accident. The weather in the Pyrenees is famous for being unpredictable and I'm sure Daniel would have been warned by the locals. You were not close with him? Not since his mother died, I'm sorry to say. What was he doing out there? He was on pilgrimage on the Camino. Walking the road to Santiago de Compostela. People from very different backgrounds, faiths and generations have walked the path from here in the French Pyrenees to Santiago de Compostela, kilometers on the north-western coast of Spain, for over a thousand years. We believers are told that the remains of St James, the apostle of Jesus, are interred there. And so we make pilgrimage. This is what your son Daniel was doing. Why he was alone? Many people choose to make the trek alone. The Way is a very personal journey, Mr. Avery. This is the shell. The symbol of the pilgrim making the journey. And this... This is Daniel's passport for the Camino. It is to be officially stamped at every important stop along the route through Spain. And the first stamp is here, in Saint-Jean. Buen Camino. When you arrive at the end, the passport should look like this. I have walked the Camino to the Atlantic Ocean three times. There and back. I will do it once more, on my 70th birthday. God willing, of course. Daniel was my only child. We can also offer cremation if that is a more suitable way for you to transport the remains back home. - I'm sorry, I don't speak French. - Oh, do you mind if I sit here? Because there's no other seats available. Hi. I'm Joost. I'm from Amsterdam. - Tom. - Hey, Tom. I saw you on the train this morning. We came from Paris. We were on the same train. You're not a pilgrim, are you? A pilgrim? A trekker? A peregrino? Huh? You're not here to walk the Santiago de Compostela. - No, I'm here on family business. - Ah. Well, it's not for everyone, you know. In fact, somebody died on the Camino this week, only one day into the trek. Yeah, such a tragedy. Yes. But it's no mystery why I'm doing this trek. You see this gut? My older brother is getting married in Rotterdam in December and I want to fit into my old suit. You could just buy a new suit. No, but it's the third time that he's getting married. But wedding or not, I mean... A bit leaner, a bit lighter. It would make my doctor and my wife a bit happier. No? Ah! Oh! It's for energy. Listen. My doctorate... I'm not gonna finish it. You mean this year? I mean ever. I can't learn about the world in school. You're not just in school. You're at Berkeley. Take a semester off, sure, but don't throw away the last years of your life. When was the last time you travelled abroad? And I'm not talking about for business. Nepal. Morocco. India. Papua New Guinea. Europe. I gotta go to these places. I gotta go. I gotta go. - Captain. - Mr. Avery. I want to cremate the body. I'm gonna walk the Camino to Santiago. Mr. Avery, if you pardon me, please, you are not prepared to go on this trek. - You have no equipment or... - I've got Danny's backpack - and all his stuff. - But you haven't trained for this walk. And no disrespect, you are more than years old. So it'll take me a bit longer than most. You will be lucky if you finish in two months. Then I'd better get started. We're leaving in the morning. ""We""? Both of us. Okay. Here we go. Came to give me another pep talk, Captain? I came to wish you buen Camino, Mr. Avery. And to give you this. - Is this a good-luck charm? - Something like that. You'll know what to do with it when you get there. - Get where? - Cruz de Ferro. It's on the Camino. You'll be there a month from now. You can read about it in the guide. It's a place of much significance. Mr. Avery, do you know why you are walking the Way? I suppose I'm doing it for Daniel. You walk the Way for yourself. Only for yourself. Well, then, I guess I don't have a clue, Captain. Mr. Avery, I have also lost a child. I wish you a buen Camino. Enjoy your pilgrimage. Both of you. Thank you. Tom. This is the way. Peregrino! Shh! Sorry. - Are you American? - Yes. Americans are always late. Well. You speak English. So do you. It's my first time in Spain. You are not only in Spain. You are in the Basque Country. We are in Navarra. Well, is there a room in the Basque Country in Navarra? A room? You mean a bed? A bed, a room, it's all the same. I'm very tired. euros for a bed and food. But it's late, so no food. No more cooking. No food, but still euros? - Yes. - Okay. Shoes here. Bathroom there. You're here. Welcome to Roncesvalles. Buenas noches. Pardon me, sir. Do you have any Grey Poupon? I followed the same route as you to a point, but then I detoured at Valcarlos. And that's why I got here a couple of hours before you. My guidebook didn't say anything about any detours. Yeah, but that's because you haven't got the Dutch guidebook. - The Dutch guidebook? - Yep. Because we Dutch, we're always trying to find the quickest way to get to the next party. Because you know what they say, ""If it ain't Dutch, it ain't much."" - Did the old woman feed you? - No. Well, you're lucky. The meal was as grim as the beds. Here. Have this. - No, I can't take your food. - Yeah, you can. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Pamplona in a couple of days. Hemingway, running of the bulls, all that. - I think I might stay there for... - Peregrinos! No drugs here! I know what I smell! I will call the Guardia Civil! - Yeah. - I will call the police! - Yeah. - Yeah! - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah! What did she mean, drugs? Oh, nothing. Well, nothing by Dutch standards. Just a little tobacco booster. To help with sleep. - You want some, Tom? - No. Thank you. Sure? I'm sure. Here. I also have these options. Ambien, earplugs. I know you've got a thing for Dutch men, señora. Have you ever walked the Camino, señora? No, never. When I was young, I was too busy. And now that I am older, I'm too tired. Buen Camino. Hey, Tom, we should get a coffee here before we go. Just to get our motor running, no? Yeah, we'll have a quick coffee. Oh, look! A cheese maker, Tom! Fresh goat cheese, my man! Come on, Tom! You haven't lived until you have goat cheese from these mountains. Are you gonna make it, fat man? Don't you worry about me, old man. Hey, Tom. When we met in Saint-Jean, you said nothing about going on pilgrimage. I wasn't going on pilgrimage. But here we are. Yeah. You said you were on family business? I am. But you have all the equipment for the walk to Santiago. Yeah. Tom, that box with the ashes... My son. I'm done for the day, Joost. I'm staying here tonight. - Here? In this village? - Yeah. But Pamplona's a stone's throw away. My feet are killing me. I gotta get out of these shoes. I'm sorry, but not me, man. - Pamplona beckons! - Okay. It's been a pleasure, Tom. Hey, uh, buen Camino. Ah! - I don't speak Spanish. - We were expecting you. Expecting me? - You are a pilgrim, sí? - Yes. We are always expecting pilgrims. Come, we have plenty of beds and your food is still warm. Hey, the Americans are here! Bueno, bueno, bueno! Come. Vamos. Come on. The truth of the matter is confused. No, Charlemagne had other ideas. To extend his empire. He crossed the Pyrenees, but nothing worked out as he intended. This is Spain! This is Basque Spain! He tortured the Basques of Pamplona and allowed his men to have a little too much rest and relaxation with our women. When the Basque shepherds, who lived around here, heard what happened in Pamplona, they slipped into the woods, and we, we Basques, killed them. Sorry, monsieur, but based on what I have read here, that is complete crap. D'accord? You won't find much truth in this book. Charlemagne. Roland. Not ""Rolan"", Roland. This is part of French history, okay? No, not Basque! The French don't want to admit that the death of Roland was because of Charlemagne's un-Christian intentions. Come on! Allez! Wait a minute, wait a minute. - Night. - Wait a minute. Señor, señor. I thought it was the Arabs that killed Roland. One of the guys said you're Canadian. Don't spread it around, eh? So how's it going for you out there on the road, Boomer? I'm Tom. You know, as in ""baby boomer"". You got all those horrible signs of that desperate generation taking its final breath, trying to screw the rest of us over one last time. Only thing missing from you, Boomer, is one of those stupid-looking ponytails and a collection of James Taylor songs on your iPod. I like James Taylor, but I don't have an iPod. Well, that's pretty amazing. What? No iPod, no cell phone or computer to keep you connected? Isn't it written somewhere in the Baby Boomer Code Book that you must own a certain percentage of anything Steve Jobs makes? So what is it? On pilgrimage to change your life? - Something like that. - Wait. Don't tell me. Just getting over a nasty divorce and she took it all? Or maybe you're out to meet some young chicks and relive your college glory days. Believe me, I've seen plenty of that nonsense. Oh, I got it. You're seeking penance for screwing over your company retirees in some stock market scandal. You sound really angry. Yeah. Sure. I'm angry. I gotta quit these and I'm really, really angry about that. And when we get to Santiago de Compostela, it's all over for you, my little friend. You're a goner. The end of the Camino is the end of my addiction. Spoken like a true addict. Spoken like someone who took days to get this far. Well, at that pace you should get to Santiago by the end of the year. He's onto our plan. But, you know... I wanted to be a bullfighter. My father wanted me to be a lawyer. I became neither. Coffee is in the common area. Bonjour, Americano! I thought you might be staying at least a few more days here, eh? Funny. These European guys are starting to get a little familiar. I want to get out of here while they're still sleeping off their hangover. Besides, I got all the friends I need. Don't want any tagalongs, so... Well, be safe out there. You too, Boomer. - Good luck with the quitting. - Yeah. Good luck with whatever it is you're doing out here. We're all just taking a really long walk, I suppose. That's one way to look at it. Oh! I do have a cell phone. Yeah, well, me, too. And an iPod. Sorry for being such an ass last night. I'm out here to get away from everything and you just... Reminded you of it. Yeah, I get it. Well... You're all right, Boomer. Even if you do like James Taylor. I'm gonna need you to cancel all my appointments for the rest of the month, Doreen. Oh, no! Buen Camino. Tom! Tom, it's me! Tom, it's Joost! From Amsterdam! It's cordero. Spain is famous for its roast lamb. Mmm! - Here. You should try some. - No. Thank you. Much to my dismay, Pamplona is just an ordinary Spanish city when the bulls are not running. So much for being a party town. But I've made reservations to return here in July during the week of fiestas. The Sanfermines! I would like to propose a toast. 'Cause we Dutch love to propose toasts. That we agree to meet here in July and run with the bulls, like real men. Like real crazy men. Well, I'm gonna come back. - Wine shots, huh? - Yeah. What are your plans? To move through Pamplona quickly, and as long as I'm sitting here, I might just order some tapas. - Señor! - They're called pintxos. I beg your pardon, Joost. In Pamplona they're called tapas. Here in Pamplona, it's ""tapas"". I just read that. You see, unlike the Dutch guidebook, which may be directing you to the nearest party, the American guidebook is designed so that you don't look like a clown if you order ""pintxos"" when you really mean ""tapas."" - Señor? - Tom. Señor? Algo más? Tapas, por favor. Tapas? Aquíno hay ""tapas"". - No hay tapas? - No, no, no. ""Tapas"" es más de Madrid, del Sur. Aquíestamos en Navarra, en Navarra, son los pintxos. Quiere pintxos? Oh, look! It's Tom Quixote and Sancho Panza. And that would make you Dulcinea. Buen Camino, fellow pilgrim. Buen Camino. My name is Joost. I'm from Amsterdam. Dutch, huh? Got any drugs? - Oh, I love this girl! - It wears off quick, I promise. - You know each other? - Sort of. - What are you looking to score? - Something for sleep. I've had trouble sleeping for the past, I don't know, couple of years. Do you folks mind doing this drug deal while we walk? I've got some Ambien. Or something stronger if that's your pleasure. I love this guy! It wears off quick, I promise. - Come. Come with us. - Oh! Tom, wait. I tried to quit once. But then I thought, ""why?"" My grandmother, she drank and she smoked her entire life and she lived to be years old. Now what does that tell you? It tells me that everyone who is trying to quit something always has an ancient relative they use as an example of why not to quit. - I suppose that makes me a cliché, then. - You said it. But I'm not the one trying to quit anything. Yeah, well... We keep walking at this pace, quitting isn't gonna be the problem. Surviving will be. Doesn't this guy ever stop to smell the flowers? - This isn't a race. - No, it isn't. Then why does it piss me off so much that I haven't seen him stop to take a break? Why does something that should be inspirational make me so angry? Totally irrational. The same could be said for this entire journey. - Wonder how old he is. - Older than us. Hey, Tom! You think I'll look like this by the time I get to Santiago? Yeah, sure, Joost. Just keep eating that cordero. Nothing like a few pounds of lamb to help shed the excess weight. But it's part of the Camino experience, no? I mean, you can't come to Spain without having their roast lamb. ""Where the path of the wind crosses that of the stars."" What do you think the waist is on this guy? 32? More like a or 26. Well, a man can dream. What? You can do this on a bike? Why the hell are we walking? Oh, that's ridiculous, man. Try that. It's super strong. I brought it from Amsterdam. It's really good. You do smoke up? Hey, I'm Frank. New York. Tom, California. Nice to meet you, Rabbi. Oh, actually I'm a priest. You can understand my confusion. Yeah, a lot of people make that mistake. Brain cancer. The surgery left me with a terrible scar. I wear this yarmulke to cover it up. They didn't get it all, you know? The cancer. Said it'll probably come back. Who knows about these kinds of things? Only God. Anyway, they say that miracles happen out here on the Camino de Santiago. Do you believe in miracles, Father? I'm a priest. It's kind of my job. - You a Catholic? - I don't practise any more. You know, Mass at Christmas, Easter. That's about it. Here. Take this. - No, I can't take your rosary, Father. - No, please, take it. A lot of lapsed Catholics out here on the Camino, kid. Besides... Thank you. Fore! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! I'm sorry! Sorry! I didn't mean to do that! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I thought I was out here all alone. - You thought wrong. - Oh, yes. Hello! I'm Jack from Ireland. I'm Jack from Ireland. How long you been out here, Jack from Ireland? On the Camino or in this particular spot? - You pick. - On the Camino, well, jeez... It's hard to say. This spot, well... It's hard to say that, too. But I think this place means something. ""This place means something""? This place is brimming with significance! That's the problem with this whole damn road. - Problem? - Metaphor, man! You're out walking all alone and suddenly in the middle of nowhere you see a dogfight near a cheese farm. What does that dogfight mean? And despite its literalness, the idea of a pilgrim's journey on this road is a metaphor bonanza! Friends, the road itself is amongst our oldest tropes. The high road and the low. The long and winding. The lonesome. The royal. The open road and the private. You have the road to hell. The tobacco road. The crooked, the straight and the narrow. There's the road stretching into infinity, bordered with lacy mists, favored by sentimental poets. There's the more dignified road of Mr. Frost. And for Yanks, every four years, there is the road to the White House. There is the right road. Then you have the road which most concerns me today. The wrong road. Which I fear I must surely have taken. Well, Jack, maybe a dogfight near a cheese farm is simply a dogfight near a cheese farm. Ah! Okay! That's good. That is very good. Dog fight near a cheese farm... Maybe there's no such thing as metaphors. Maybe I should adopt a more conservative attitude instead of trying to trickle meaning out of every curve in the road. Christ, I haven't had an original thought in months. Writer's block. You know what that is? Any of you? Writer's block? And I... - I'm a writer. - Okay, so... The reason I'm out here walking the Camino. Writer's block. I figure the sooner we get the small talk out of the way, the better. Now you know why I'm on pilgrimage. Great. Hmm... Mailbox full. - Ah! - You have unheard messages. All from my editors, who probably think I'm drinking again. Which isn't a bad idea. Well, they'll get their book. Maybe not when they want it, but they'll get it, by God! Ooh! Can I bum one of those, please? Oh. Uh, yes, sure. Sure. Thank you. So, uh, what's your book about, Jack? - The Camino, of course. - Of course. - What about all of you? - What about all of us what? Why you're doing the Camino. Most of the pilgrims I've polled say their walk to Santiago is for religious, cultural or historical reasons. - You're taking a poll? - Aye, informally, though I have been keeping track of most of the pilgrims I've met along the way. So far, less than percent said they were doing it for health. Fewer than five percent said they were out here looking for a miracle. Miracles are in short supply these days, Jack. Well, if you don't mind, I'd like to include you in my poll. I do mind. Very much so. Oh, uh... Would it be all right if I walk with you for a bit? Well, I don't know about them. Oh, okay. But it's okay. It's cool with me, man. - Really? - Yeah, sure. I'm Joost. I'm from Amsterdam. Joost? Right. Hey. I mean, I'm not here for God or miracles or any of that stuff. I'm just a fat Dutchman trying to lose a few pounds. So you're doing it for health reasons? Yeah, you could more or less say that. Yeah. Yeah, well, would it be all right if I put you under the category ""doing it for health"" for my poll? - Yeah, man, sure. Whatever. Yeah. - Really? Joost. Dutch. Health. Ah. Thanks. Would you like to try some of this? It's Turkish. I hear it's good for writer's block. You may be right, Joost. Yeah, man. Tom! Hey, Tom! Everything all right? Yeah, sure. So what's her story? Tom met her in a refugio. Walking the Camino to quit smoking. That's all I know about her. She's sexy but complicated. He seems like quite a stiff. I met him in Saint-Jean. He's an ophth... Um... An eye doctor from California. An ophthalmologist. He didn't come here on pilgrimage. Seems like it was more like an accident. I started my pilgrimage in Paris, Joost. Three months ago. And if I know one certainty about the Way of St James, it is that no one walks this Camino by accident. No one. He carries the cremated remains of his son. He got caught in a bad storm over the Pyrenees, first day out. - Oh, you're kidding me. - No. He carries that box in his backpack. He leaves little piles of ash all along the Camino. That's brilliant! I mean, tragic, of course. But brilliant. Um... Do you think he'd want to talk to me about it? I think he'd sooner shove that walking stick down your throat. - You're sick. - What? The reason you're out here. - You're ill and dying. - Not even close. That's good. But I will get it. No, you probably won't. Next town is Torres Del Río."
69,2008,Doubt,American,"In 1964 at a Catholic church in The Bronx, New York Father Flynn gives a sermon on the nature of doubt, noting that like faith, doubt can be a unifying force. Sister Aloysius, the strict principal of the parish school, becomes concerned when she sees a boy pull away from Father Flynn in the school courtyard. At dinner, she asks her fellow nuns if they know why Father Flynn would preach about doubt, and instructs them to be alert to a possible problem in the school.
One day during class, Sister James, a young and naive teacher, receives a request for Donald Miller, an altar boy and the school's only black student, to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is upset and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. Later, she sees Father Flynn placing an undershirt in Donald's locker. She reports her suspicions to Sister Aloysius.
Sisters Aloysius and James confront Father Flynn. Several times, he asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but Sister Aloysius persists. Finally, he is pressured into saying that Donald had been caught drinking altar wine and that he will now need to be dismissed as an altar boy. Sister James is relieved and believes Father Flynn's explanation, but Sister Aloysius is not convinced.
Father Flynn gives a sermon on bearing false witness and gossip. Sister James asks him about the shirt he put in Donald's locker, an observation she had kept from Sister Aloysius. Father Flynn explains that the boy had left the shirt in the sacristy, and that he had put it in the locker to spare the boy additional embarrassment. Flynn goes on to say that it is he, not Sister Aloysius, that really cares about the boy.
Sister Aloysius meets with Donald Miller's mother regarding her suspicions. Mrs. Miller shocks Sister Aloysius with her lack of interest in the alleged misconduct on Father Flynn's part. As far as she is concerned, Donald need only last to the end of the school year, as graduation from a prestigious church school would increase his chances of going to a decent high school. It is hinted that Donald is homosexual and that his father is physically abusive because of it. Mrs. Miller begs Sister Aloysius to leave Donald out of her campaign against Father Flynn.
Father Flynn demands that Sister Aloysius stop trying to destroy his reputation. Sister Aloysius responds that he must confess and resign. Father Flynn is adamant that there is no illicit relationship, but Sister Aloysius claims that she has learned that he has a history of problems, having moved to three different parishes in the last five years. She tells him that she has contacted a nun from one of his prior churches, who corroborated her suspicions. Father Flynn is furious that she has contacted a nun rather than the church pastor, which is proper church protocol. Sister Aloysius threatens to visit his previous parishes and contact parents if necessary. Father Flynn agrees to request a transfer.
Following his final sermon, Father Flynn steps down from the pulpit and shakes hands with the members of the congregation. Some time later, Sisters Aloysius and James are sitting together in the church garden. Sister Aloysius tells Sister James that despite her warning, the bishop has appointed him to pastor at a larger church with a parochial school, promoting him to a more prestigious position and perpetuating the problem. She admits to having lied about speaking to a nun at Father Flynn's former church, saying it would not have worked if he was innocent. Sister Aloysius concludes that she has paid a price in pursuing the wrongdoing of Father Flynn. She breaks down in tears and says to Sister James: ""I have doubts...I have such doubts.""",7.5,tt0918927,"Doubt.DVDSCR.XviD-NEPTUNE Jimmy, come on. You're serving today. Christeeeen! Where's my pants? On the bed. If they had teeth, they would've bit you. If my pants had teeth... Doubt timing and subtitles by pee-jay Jimmy! Go to the store, buy me the newspaper and cigarettes. Can't. Serving mass. I'm an alter boy. - Hey, Kevin! - Hey, Jimmy! - There you are. - Overslept. Well, you made it. I'll do the cruets if you light the charcoal. You think I'm fat? You're alright. What? Clothes don't fit? No, they fit. You're gonna be going to the bakery after mass. - I am? Why don't you go? - I'm gonna be making breakfast. - I can make breakfast. - When have you ever? Funny man. Good morning, Father. Good morning, Father. Be seated. What do you do when you're not sure? That's the topic of my sermon today. Last year, when President Kennedy was assassinated, who among us did not experience the most profound disorientation? Despair? Which way? What now? What do I say to my kids? What do I tell myself? It was a time of people sitting together, bound together by a common feeling of hopelessness. But think of that! Your BOND with your fellow being was your Despair. It was a public experience. It was awful, but we were in it together. How much worse is it then for the lone man, the lone woman, stricken by a private calamity? ""No one knows I'm sick."" ""No one knows I've lost my last real friend."" ""No one knows I've done something wrong."" Imagine the isolation. Now you see the world as through a window. On one side of the glass: happy, untroubled people, and on the other side: you. - God Bless you, Sister. - Thank you. I want to tell you a story. A cargo ship sank one night. It caught fire and went down. And only this one sailor survived. He found a lifeboat, rigged a sail... and being of a nautical discipline... turned his eyes to the Heavens and read the stars. He set a course for his home, and exhausted, fell asleep. Clouds rolled in. And for the next twenty nights, he could no longer see the stars. He thought he was on course, but there was no way to be certain. And as the days rolled on, and the sailor wasted away, he began to have doubts. Had he set his course right? Was he still going on towards his home? Or was he horribly lost and doomed to a terrible death? No way to know. The message of the constellations--- had he imagined it because of his desperate circumstance? Or had he seen truth once... Straighten. Up. and now had to hold on to it without further reassurance? There are those of you in church today who know exactly the crisis of faith I describe. And I want to say to you: Doubt can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty. When you are lost, you are not alone. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Please rise. - Hey, Father. - Hey, Champ. That was some sermon. Did it mean something to you? I want to do that. I want to be a priest. You'd be a good one, I'm sure. Here. Take a look. See? She's dancin'. Kinda neat. - Yeah. - Here. You try. That's for you. Take it. - Thank you, Father. - You're welcome. Like Noah's Ark, girls. Two by two. Morning, Sister James. Good morning, Father Flynn. Beautiful day. Not too bad. How are the criminals doing today? - Not bad, Father. - Good, Father. - Morning, Champ. - Morning, Father Flynn. You wash those hands today, Mister London? I washed em, Father. I don't know. They're a different color than your neck. - Good morning. - Good morning, Father. - Sister, are we having the test today? - Tomorrow, William. - Is it long division? - Among other things. - Sister. - Good morning, Sister. - How much of it will be long division? - Boy! William London. Come up here! Come smartly now. Don't make me wait. - What did he do? - He touched Sister James. The dragon is hungry! You don't touch a nun. Take out your history books, please. Turn to page 683. Yes, Ralph. - I forgot my history book. - You can look on with Raymond. Mr. London? Do you have your history book? - No, Sister. - Share with Mr. Malloy, please. Do I have to? His breath stinks! I'm sure Mr. Malloy's breath is just fine. Be seated. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the 32nd president of The United States. That barrette out of your hair, Miss Horan. Yes, Sister. Morning, Sister James. Continue. Franklin D. Roosevelt, together with Abraham Lincoln and John Fitzgerald Kennedy, was perhaps our greatest president. When he assumed office, 13,000,000 people in this country were unemployed. They'd lost hope. And President Roosevelt said to these people: ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" What did he mean by that? James? I think he was trying to say there's nothing really wrong, you know? So don't get so emotional. Maybe... Maybe he was saying that the world is good and we need only work together to overcome our problems. What's this, Mr. Conroy? I don't know, Sister. You don't know you have a wire coming out of your ear? - No. - Huh? Huh? No, Sister. I didn't. You come with me, boy. Go. Who knows what the New Deal was? I love this song. This past Sunday. What do you think that sermon was about? - Sister James. - Huh? What was Father Flynn's sermon about? Well, Doubt. He was talking about Doubt? Why? Excuse me, Sister? Well, sermons come from somewhere, don't they? Is Father Flynn in Doubt? Is he concerned that someone else is in Doubt? I suppose you'd have to ask him. No, that would not be appropriate. He is my superior. And if he were troubled, he should confess it to a fellow priest, or to the Monsignor. We do not share intimate information with priests. - No. - That's true. - What are we saying? - I want you all to be alert. I am concerned, perhaps needlessly, about matters in St. Nicholas School. Academically? I was not inviting a guessing game, Sister Raymond. Missy! Get away from her. And sit down. May I join you, Sister Aloysius? Yes. - Chicken Chow Mein. - Sister Veronica's favorite. - It's very good. - I like the noodles. I like the crunch. - What happened to William London? - I sent him home. Oh dear. So he's still bleeding? Yes. His nose just let loose and started gushing during the Pledge of Allegiance. Was it spontaneous? - What? - His nosebleed. - What else would it be? - Self-induced. You mean you think he might've intentionally given himself a nosebleed? Exactly. No. You are a very innocent person, Sister James. William London is a fidgety boy. If you do not keep right on him, he will do anything to escape his chair. He would set his foot on fire for half a day out of school. Here. Sister, allow me to help you. Your sleeve. Mmm. Let's see. Oh thank you, Sister. - Sister Veronica is going blind. - Oh how horrible! If they find out in the rectory, she'll be gone. So, if she looks unsteady, take her hand. Ordinarily, I assign my most experienced teachers to eighth grade, but I am working within constraints. - Are you in control of your class? - I think so. Usually more students are sent down to me. - I try to take care of things myself. - That can be an error. You are answerable to me, I to the Monsignor, he to the Bishop, and so on up to the Holy Father. There is a chain. Make use of it. - Candy? - Cough drops. Candy by another name. - How is Donald Miller doing? - Steady. Good. That girl... Noreen Horan. I've seated her as far away from the boys as possible. Doesn't do much good. Just get her through. Intact. What's this? The wind is so... peripatetic this year. Is that the word I want? Is something the matter? - What? - Is something the matter? No. Why? Is something the matter? - I don't think so. - Well, then, nothing's the matter then. - Yes. - What's this? - A pen? - A ballpoint pen. The students are not using them for assignments, I hope? - No, of course not. - I'm sorry I allowed even cartridge pens into this school. Always the easy way out these days. Every easy choice today will have its consequence tomorrow. - Mark my words. - Yes. Ballpoints make them press down, when they press down, they write like monkeys. - I don't allow them ballpoint pens. - And yet here one is. Penmanship is dying all across this country. I hope not. You should frame something. Put it up on the blackboard. Put the Pope up. That's the wrong Pope. He's deceased. I don't care what Pope it is. Use the glass to see behind you. The children should think you have eyes in the back of your head. - Wouldn't that be a little frightening? - Only to the ones who are up to no good. Relax. Put it up there. All right, now. The thing about shooting from the foul line is it's psychological. All right, come up with a routine. All right, shift your weight, move your hips... Hey, you think that's funny, Ralph? You know what's funny is you never getting a foul shot. All right, concentrate on the routine, and you'll forget to get tensed up. All right, go ahead, Jimmy. Good man. You listen. That's good. All right, now sit down. Everyone. Good. On another matter, I've noticed several of you guys got dirty nails. I don't want to see that. I'm not talking about the length of your nails, I'm talking about cleanliness. See? Look at my nails. All right, they're long, I like them a little long, but look at how clean they are. That makes it okay. The climpity-clomp. Clomp clomp clomp. Harder than a herd of elephants. You are wicked! No, I told her, ""You're her mother! You raised her, you fed her, YOU tell her she's fat!"" - Oh! - But wait, how fat is she? - What, the mother or the daughter? - The daughter. - I never met the daughter. - What about the mother? Fat!!! Father, we having practice after school? If you guys want it, we can have it. Let me know. The Fascist governments of Germany and Italy were already working together. They formed the Pact of Steel. The Pact of Steel was a military alliance between Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. Mister London, get back in your seat and stop bothering Miss Horan, please. Now, who can tell me--- Yes? Yes. Of course, Father. Donald? You should go to the Rectory. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Go one, two, three, touch. One, two, three, kick. And back, side, front, kick. Back, side, front... - Raymond, what are you doing? - The mashed potato. You're supposed to be doing the bossa nova. But I know the mashed potato. All right, now follow. Back, side, front, kick. Back, side, one, two, three, kick. Back, side, front, kick. Back, side, front. Okay. Let me get in front of you so that you can see what I'm doing. One, two, three... Okay. Donald, are you feeling ill? No. You sure? Are you all right? - Good afternoon, Sister. - Good afternoon, Sister James. Sister, can I speak with you about Donald Miller? - Is he being accepted? - He has no friends. That would be a lot to expect after only two months. - Has anyone hit him? - No. Someone will. And when that happens, send them right down to me. I'm not so sure anyone will. This parish serves Irish and Italian families. Someone will hit Donald Miller. He has a protector. Who? Father Flynn. What? He's taken an interest. I told you to come to me, but I hoped you never would. Maybe I shouldn't have. So it's happened. What? I'm not telling you that! I'm not even certain what you mean. Oh excuse me there, Sisters! No bother we're done here! Come, Sister. What have you seen? It is unsettling to look at people with suspicion. I feel less close to God. When you take a step to address wrongdoing, you are taking a step away from God, but in His service. What have you seen? Good afternoon, Sisters! Good afternoon, Mrs. Carson. Why the cat? Because there's a mouse. Want some tea? If you don't want to dance with her, don't dance with her. - Well, is it wrong? - No. But what if the girl turns you down? You have the right to ask a girl to dance. All right, she has the right to turn you down. The trick is don't take it to heart. What if they ALL turn you down? Well, then you become a priest. All right, next question. What have you seen? He called Donald Miller to the Rectory. - What for? - A talk. - Alone? - Yes. - When? - A week ago, during class. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't think there was anything wrong with it. Of all the children. Donald Miller. - I suppose it makes sense. - How does it make sense? He's isolated. - I don't know that anything is wrong! - Our first Negro student. I thought there would be fighting. A parent or two to deal with. I should have foreseen this possibility. How could you imagine it? It's my job to outshine the fox in cleverness. - That is my job! - But maybe it's nothing! Then why do you look like you've seen the Devil? It's just the way the boy acted when he came back to class. - He said something? - No. It was his expression. He looked frightened and he... put his head on the desk in the most peculiar way. And... And one other thing. There was... I think there was alcohol on his breath. There WAS alcohol on his breath. Years ago at St. Boniface there was a priest... But I had Father Scully then. Here there's no man I can go to, men run everything. We are going to have to stop him ourselves. There we go! She got him! It takes a cat. Yes it does. Yes it does. - This towel will never be dead white again. - Yes it will. - Mrs. Carson! - I'm fine. - What happened? - There's a branch down. - Are you alright, Sister? - She didn't see it. I'm fine. Just bushwhacked. No need for a fuss. You just go lie down. I'll bring you some tea. Come on. Mister McGuinn? Could you look in on the courtyard? A branch has fallen. A branch has--- Watch your step here, Sister. I'll cut it up. The world is crashing, Michael. I haven't heard a wind like that since I left Mullingar! I've never known a wind like it. The wind has changed. What are you doing out here, Conroy? I talked in class, Father. Waiting for Sister Aloysius. - She know you're here? - She knows. Good morning, Father Flynn. Good of you to come by. Good morning, Sister Aloysius. How are you today? I'm very well, thank you. Mister Conroy. - Yes, Sister. - Mister Transistor Radio. Multiplication table 10x in its totality delivered to me tomorrow morning. Legible, Boy! Return to class. Go. Go, go. I'd invite you in, but we're just short Sister James. - Hear that wind last night? - I certainly did! Did I hear Sister Veronica had an accident? Yes, Sister Veronica fell and practically killed herself. - Is she alright? - Oh, she's fine. - Her sight isn't good, is it? - Her sight is fine. Nuns fall, you know. Nah, I didn't know that. It's the habit. It catches us up more often than not. We go down like dominoes. - Am I past the time? - Not at all. Good morning, Father. Good morning, Sister. I'm sorry I was delayed. I ran into Sister Veronica. - How is she? - I'm afraid she has a bit of a bloody nose. I'm beginning to think you're punching people. - Sister? - First William London and now ... Never mind. Well, come in, please. Sister... Please. Sit. Have a seat. I actually have a hot pot of tea. And close this but not quite for form's sake. Father, would you care for a... - Would you have a cup of tea, Father? - I would love a cup of tea. - Sister, perhaps you could serve him? - I'd be glad. And yourself, of course. Would you like a cup of tea, Sister Aloysius? - No, I've already had my cup. - Is there sugar? Sugar? Yes! Yes. It's somewhere here. I put it in the drawer for Lent last year and never remembered to take it out. Ah, it mustn't have been much to give up then. I'm sure you're right. Here it is. I'll serve you, though for want of practice, I'm, I'm a little clumsy. I see your fingernails. I wear them a little long. - The Sugar? - Yes. - One? - Three. - Three? - Sweet tooth. Two... Three... - Sister, you care for sugar? - Never! Not that there's anything wrong with sugar. Well, thank you, Father, for making time for us. We are at our wit's end. Well, I think it's an excellent idea to rethink the Christmas pageant. 'Cause last year's effort was a little woebegone. Oh, I loved it! But I love all pageants. The hymns! O Little Town of Bethlehem, O Come O Come Emmanuel, - O Come All Ye Faithful... - All right. Thank you, Sister James! So what do you think, Father? Is there something new we could do? Well, we all love the Christmas hymns, but it might be jolly to include a secular song. Secular? Yes. IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK A LOT LIKE CHRISTMAS. Something like that. What would be the point of a secular song? Just fun. - Or FROSTY THE SNOWMAN. - That's a good one. We could have one of the boys dress as a snowman and dance around. Which boy? We'd do tryouts. FROSTY THE SNOWMAN espouses a pagan belief in magic. The snowman comes to life when an enchanted hat is put on his head. If the music were more somber, people would realize the images are disturbing and the song heretical. I've never thought about Frosty The Snowman like that. - It should be banned from the airwaves. - So. Not FROSTY THE SNOWMAN. Oh, IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK LIKE A LOT LIKE CHRISTMAS would be fine, I suppose. Parents would like it. May I ask what you're writing down? With that ballpoint pen? Oh. Nothing. It's an idea for a sermon. - You had one right now? - I get them all the time. How fortunate. I forget them so I have to write them down. Oh. What is the idea? Intolerance. - Would you like a little more tea, Father? - Not yet. It's a new time, Sister. - What's new about this? - Something inside of people is new. There is nothing new under the sun. The Church needs to change. We should sing a song from the radio now and then. - Take the kids out for ice cream. - Sweet tooth. Maybe take the boys on a camping trip. The point being? We should be friendlier. You know, the children and the parents should see us as members of their family. But we are not members of their family. We're different. - Why? Because of our vows? - Precisely. I don't think we're so different. You know, Sister, I would take some more tea. And they think we're different, yeah? The working class... The working class people of this parish trust us to be different. Uh, I think we're getting off the subject. Yes, you're right. You're right. Back to it. Yes, Sister Raymond? Well you tell her to wash her face and her neck and report to me at three. Yes. Excuse me. The Christmas pageant. We must be careful how Donald Miller is used in the pageant. Easy there, Sister. All right, what about Donald Miller? We must be careful, in the pageant, that we neither hide Donald Miller nor put him forward. - Because of the color of his skin? - That's right, yeah. Why? Oh come, Father. I think he should be treated like every other boy. Well, you yourself singled the boy out for special attention. You held a private meeting with him at the Rectory. A week ago? Yes. What are we talking about? Donald Miller? The boy acted strangely when he returned to class. He did? When he returned from the Rectory. A little odd, yes. Can you tell us why? How did he act strangely? He... I'm not sure how to explain it. He... he laid his head on the desk, and... some... - Do you mean you had some impression? - Yes. And he'd come from the Rectory so you're asking me? That's it. Did you want to discuss the pageant, is that why I'm here, or is this what you wanted to discuss? This. Well. I'm a little uncomfortable. - Why? - Why do you think? The boy's well-being is my responsibility. His well-being is not at issue. I'm not satisfied that that is true. He was upset when he returned to class. - Did he say something? - No. What happened in the Rectory? Happened? Nothing happened. I had a talk with the boy. - What about? - Private matter. He's twelve years old. What could be private? - Should I get the phone---? - No. I object to your tone. This is not about my tone... or your tone, Father Flynn. - It's about arriving at the truth. - Of what? You know what I'm talking about. Don't you? You're controlling the expression on your face right now. Aren't you? My face? What exactly are you accusing me of? I am not accusing you of anything, Father Flynn. I am asking you to tell me what happened in the Rectory. I don't wish to continue this. And if you're dissatisfied with that, I suggest you speak to Monsignor Benedict. I can only imagine this unfortunate behavior is the result of overwork. Have a good morning. Sister. Sister. There was alcohol on his breath. When he returned from his meeting with you. Alcohol. I did smell it on his breath. Well? - Let this alone. - No. Take your time, Father. Would you like some more tea? You should've let it alone. Not possible. Mr. McGuinn caught Donald drinking altar wine. When I found out, I sent for him. There were tears. And he begged not to be removed from the altar boys. I took pity on him. I told him if no one else found out, I would let him stay on. Oh, what a relief! That explains everything! Thanks be to God! Look, Sister, it was all a mistake! And if I talk to Mr. McGuinn? Oh, talk to him by all means. But now that the boy's secret's out, I'm going to have to remove him from the altar boys. That's what I was trying to avoid. - You were trying to protect the boy! - That's right. I might have done the same thing! Is there a way Donald could stay on the altar boys? If the boy drank altar wine, he can't continue as an altar boy. Of course. - Are you satisfied? - Yes. Well, I'll be going. I have some writing to do. - Intolerance. - That's right. I'm not pleased with how you handled this, Sister. Sister. Well. What a relief! He cleared it all up. - You believe him? - Of course. Isn't it that it's easier to believe him? But we can corroborate his story with Mr. McGuinn. Yes. These types of people are clever. - Well, I'm convinced! - You're not. You just want things to be resolved so you can have simplicity back. I want no further part of this. I'll bring him down. How can you be so sure that he is lying? Experience. You just don't like him! You don't like it that he uses a ballpoint pen. You don't like it that he takes three lumps of sugar in his tea. You don't like it that he likes FROSTY THE SNOWMAN. And you're letting that convince you of something terrible, just terrible! Well, I like FROSTY THE SNOWMAN! And I think it would be nice if this school weren't run like a jail! And I think it's a good thing that I love to teach History and that I might inspire my students to love it, too! And if you judge that to mean that I'm not fit to be a teacher, then so be it! Sit down. Look at that. You blew out my light. In ancient Sparta, important matters were decided by who shouted loudest. Fortunately, we are not in ancient Sparta. You honestly find the students in this school to be treated like inmates in a prison? No. Actually, they all seem fairly happy. But they're all uniformly terrified of you! Yes. That's how it works. Sit there. Hello, this is Sister Aloysius Beauvier, principal at St. Nicholas School. Is this Mrs. Miller? I'm calling about your son, Donald. A woman was gossiping with a friend about a man she hardly knew-- I know none of you have ever done this--- --that night she had a dream. A great hand appeared over her and pointed down at her. She was immediately seized with an overwhelming sense of guilt. The next day she went to confession. She got the old parish priest, Father O'Rourke, and she told him the whole thing. ""Is gossiping a sin?"" she asked the old man. ""Was that the hand of God Almighty pointing a finger at me?"" ""Should I be asking your absolution? Father, tell me, have I done something wrong?"" ""Yes!"" Father O'Rourke answered her. ""Yes, you ignorant, badly brought-up female! You have borne false witness against your neighbor, you have played fast and loose with his reputation, and you should be heartily ashamed!"" So the woman said she was sorry and asked for forgiveness. ""Not so fast!"" says O'Rourke. ""I want you to go home, take a pillow up on your roof, cut it open with a knife, and return here to me!"" So the woman went home, took a pillow off her bed, a knife from the drawer, went up the fire escape to the roof, and stabbed the pillow. Then she went back to the old parish priest as instructed. ""Did you gut the pillow with the knife?"" he says. ""Yes, Father."" ""And what was the result?"" ""Feathers,"" she said. ""Feathers?"" he repeated. ""Feathers everywhere, Father!"" ""Now I want you to go back and gather up every last feather that flew out on the wind!"" ""Well,"" she said, ""it can't be done."" ""I don't know where they went. The wind took them all over."" ""And that,""said Father O'Rourke, ""is gossip!"" In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Amen. Please rise. What's that bird complaining about? What kind of bird is that? That a starling? A grackle? A crow. 'Course it is. Are you praying? I didn't mean to interrupt. I'm not praying, no. You seem subdued. Oh. I can't sleep. - Why not? - Bad dreams. Yeah, I can't sleep on occasion. Why? Do you see that big hand pointing a finger at you? Yes. Sometimes. Was your sermon directed at anyone in particular? What do you think? I received a letter from my brother in Maryland. He's very sick. - Then maybe you should go and see him. - I can't leave my class. Is it true? What? You know what I'm asking. No. I saw you put an undershirt in Donald Miller's locker. - He left it in the sacristy. - Why didn't you hand it to him? I'm trying to spare him further embarrassment. It's me that cares about that child, not her. Has she ever reached out a hand? That black boy needs help or he's not going to make it! If she has her way, he'll be left to his own undoing. Why do you think he drank the wine? He's in trouble! And she sees me talk in a human way to these kids and she immediately assumes that there must be something wrong with it. Well, I'm not going to let her keep this parish in the dark ages! And I'm not going to let her destroy my spirit of compassion! I'm sure that's not her intent. - That I care about this congregation! - I know you do. Like you care about your class! You love them, don't you? - Yes. - And that's natural. How else would you relate to children? That I can look at your face and know your philosophy. It's kindness. I don't know. I mean, of course. There are people who go after your humanity, Sister, that tell you the light in your heart is a weakness. Don't believe it. It's an old tactic of cruel people to kill kindness in the name of virtue. There's nothing wrong with love. Love? Have you forgotten the message of our Savior? It's love of people. I just feel as if everything is upside down. There are just times in life when we feel lost. It happens. And it's a bond. - Flowers. - To remind me of Spring. I should be going. - I'm sorry your brother's ill. - Thank you, Father. I don't believe it! You don't? No. Thank you, Sister. Thank you very much. Father, I think I've just got to tell somebody. - Hello, Noreen. - I'm in love. - That's wonderful. Who's the lucky boy? - Jimmy Hurley. Have you told him? - Maybe you should. - Maybe I will, Father. Jimmy! Jimmy Hurley! Over here. Father Sherman... You drop something. It's all right. Okay. Be quiet. I said be quiet! The next one of you that speaks out of turn gets sent right to the Principal! Now the question was: What was Patrick Henry's famous remark? - Donald. - Sister? What was the question? Nobody help him. Jimmy, put your hand down. Donald Miller, stand up. - What was the question, Donald? - I don't know, Sister. - That means you weren't listening. - Yes, Sister. The question was: What was Patrick Henry's famous remark? - I don't know. - ""Give me liberty or give me death!"" James Hurley, down to the Principal's office now! - Mrs. Miller? - Yes. Come in. Please have a seat. I was changing a bulb. I thought I mighta had the wrong day. You didn't answer. Huh? Oh. Well, just between us, Iwas listening to a transistor radio with an earpiece. Look how tiny they're making 'em. I confiscated it from one of the students, now I can't stop listening to it. You like music? No. News reports. Years ago I used to listen to all the news reports because my husband was in Italy in the war. - You were a married woman? - Yes. But then he was killed. - Is your husband coming? - Couldn't get off work. I only have a half an hour myself. I see. Of course. It was a lot to ask. How's Donald doing? He's passing his subjects. He has average grades. Hmm. Good. He was upset about getting taken off the altar boys. Did he explain why? He said he was caught drinking altar wine. That is the reason. Well, that seems fair. But he's a good boy, Sister. He fell down there, but he's a good boy pretty much down the line. How is he at home? His father beat the hell out of him over that wine. Oh, he shouldn't do that! You don't tell my husband what to do. You just stand back. My husband didn't want Donald to come here. - Why? - He thought he'd have trouble with the other boys. But that hasn't eally happened. Good. That priest, Father Flynn, been watching out for him. Yes. Excuse me. - James Hurley, what are you doing out of class? - Sister James sent me down. - What for? - Talking. Well, go back up and shut up! Go, go! What's going on? None of your business! Go on! Go back to class. Bullshit. - What'd you say? - Nothing. - You have twenty minutes you say? - It's just that I have to walk to work. - Where is work? - Parkchester. If I don't start cleaning by noon, I'm not home to let Donald in. - May I walk with you? - I don't mind. ...eight sixty-fourths. Who can tell me what the common denominator is? Nobody? Back already, Mr. Hurley? - I said, back already, Mr. Hurley?! - Leave me alone. Who do you think you're talking to? This is my classroom, Boy. Don't you forget that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jimmy. Have you met Father Flynn? Just seen him on the altar, haven't met him face to face. No. Just, you know, heard from Donald. And what does he say? Oh, you know, ""Father Flynn, Father Flynn."" He looks up to him. The man gives him his time, which is what the boy needs. He needs that. Mrs. Miller, we may have a problem. Well, I thought there musta been a reason you wanting to see me. Principal's a big job. I just want to say though, it's just till June. Excuse me? Whatever the problem is, Donald just has to make it till June. - Then he's off into high school. - Right. If Donald can graduate from St. Nicholas, he's got a better chance of getting into a good high school. And that would mean an opportunity at college. I don't see anything at this time standing in the way of his graduating with his class. - Well, that's all I care about. - I doubt that. Try me. I am concerned about the relationship between Father Flynn and your son. You don't say. Concerned. What do you mean, concerned? That it may not be right. Well, there's something wrong with everybody, isn't that so? Got to be forgiving. I work right there. I'm concerned, to be frank, that Father Flynn may have made advances on your son. - May have made. - I can't be certain. - No evidence? - No. Then maybe there's nothing to it. I think there is something to it. I think Father Flynn gave Donald that altar wine. Why would he do that? - Has Donald been acting strange lately? - No. - Nothing out of the ordinary? - He's been himself. - Alright. - Look, Sister. I don't want any trouble. I don't uhh... I'm not sure you completely understand. I think I understand the kind of thing you're talking about. But I don't want to get into it. What's that? Look, I only have a few minutes. Not to be disagreeing, but if we're talking about something floating around between this priest and my son, it ain't my son's fault. - Oh, I'm not suggesting that--- - He's just a boy. - I know. - Twelve years old. If somebody should be taking blame, it should be the man, not the boy. - I know. I agree with you completely. - You're agreeing with me, but I got called to the principal if you know what I'm saying. I am concerned about Donald's welfare. You honestly think that priest gave Donald that wine to drink? Yes, I do. Then how come my son got kicked off the altar boys - if it was the man that gave it to him? - I know. The boy got caught, the man didn't. - So you're giving my son the blame. - No. No problem my son getting blamed. And you know why that is? Perhaps you should let me talk. I think you're getting upset now. Sister, you ain't going against no MAN in a ROBE and win. - He's got the position. - And he's got your son. Let him have him then. What? It's just till June. - Do you know what you're saying? - Know more about it than you. I believe this man is creating or may have already brought about - an improper relationship with your son. - I don't know. I know I am right. Why you gotta know something like that for sure when you don't? What kind of mother are you? Excuse me, but you don't know enough about life to say - a thing like that, Sister. - I know enough. You know the rules maybe, but that don't cover it. I know what I won't accept! You accept what you gotta accept and you work with it. This man is in my school. Well, he's gotta be somewhere and maybe he's doing some good, too. He is after the boys! Well, maybe some of them boys want to get caught! That's why his father beat him. Not the wine. What are you telling me? I'm talking about the boy's nature now, not anything he's done. You can't hold a child responsible for what God gave him to be. I'm only interested in actions, Mrs. Miller. But then there's the boy's nature. - Leave that out of it. - Forget it then. You're the one forcing people to say things. My boy came to your school 'cause they were going to kill him in the public school. His father don't like him. He come to your school, kids don't like him. One man is good to him. This priest. Then does the man have his reasons? Yes. Everybody does. YOU have your reasons. But do I ask the man why he's good to my son? No. I don't care why. My son needs some man to care about him and to see him through the way he wants to go. I thank God, this educated man with some kindness in him wants to do just that. - This will not do. - It's just till June. I'll throw your son out of this school. And why would you do that if it didn't start with him? Because I will stop this. - You'd hurt my son to get your way? - It won't end with your son. - Throw the priest out then. - I am trying to do just that. Then what do you want from me? Nothing. As it turns out. Please leave my son out of this. My husband will kill that child over a thing like this. I will try. I'm late. Sister, I don't know if you and me on the same side. I'll be standing with my son and those who are good with my son. It'd be nice to see you there. Good morning. May I come in? A third party would be required. Yeah. What was Donald's mother doing here? - We were having a chat. - About what? A third party would truly be required, Father. Why--- No, Sister. No third party. You and me are due for a talk. You have to stop this campaign against me! You can stop it at any time. - How? - Confess and resign. You are attempting to destroy my reputation! Who keeps opening my window?! - What are you doing in this school? - I'm trying to do good! Even more to the point, what are you doing in the priesthood? You are single-handedly holding this school and this parish back! - From what? - Progressive education and a welcoming Church. You can't distract me, Father. This is not about my behavior, it's about yours. No, this is about your unfounded suspicions. - That's right. I have suspicions. - Just leave that. It's not important. I will decide what's important. WHY do you suspect me? What have I done? You gave that boy wine, and you let him take the blame. That's completely untrue! Did you talk to Mr. McGuinn? All McGuinn knows is that the boy drank wine. He doesn't know how he came to drink it. Did his mother have something to add to that? No. - So that's it. - I am not satisfied. - Ask the boy then! - Oh, he'd protect you. - Why would he do that? - Because you have seduced him. You're insane! You've got it in your head that I've corrupted this child after giving him wine, and nothing I say will change that. - That's right. - But this has nothing to do with the wine. Not really. You had a fundamental mistrust of me before this incident! It was you that warned Sister James to be on the lookout, wasn't it? That's true. - So you admit it! - Certainly. Why? I know people. - That's not good enough! - It won't have to be. - How's that? - You will tell me what you have done! Oh I will? Out again! Sister James is convinced I'm innocent. Oh, so you talked to Sister James? Well, of course you talked to Sister James. - Did you know that Donald's father beats him? - Yes. And might that not account for the odd behavior Sister James noticed in the boy? It might. Then what is it? What? What did you hear, what did you see that convinced you so thoroughly? - What does it matter? - It matters! What does it matter? I want to know. Out this window I saw you grab William London's wrist and... I saw him pull away. - Are you serious? - I am. - That's all? - Yeah. That was all. That's nothing! - What are you doing now? - I'm writing down what you say. It might be important when I have to explain why you have to be removed. This morning, before I spoke with Mrs. Miller, I took the precaution of calling your last parish. What'd he say? - Who? - The Pastor. I did not speak to the Pastor. I spoke to a nun. - You should have spoken to the Pastor. - I spoke to a nun. You know that's not the proper route for you to have taken, Sister! The Church is very clear. You're supposed to go through the Pastor. Why? You have an understanding, you and he? No, you have no right to go rummaging through my past! You have a history. This is your third parish in five years. - Call the Pastor. - Why? Ask him why I left! It's perfectly innocent. - I'm not calling the Pastor. - I'm a good priest! You will go after another child and another child, until you are stopped. - What nun did you speak to? - I won't say. - I've not touched a child. - You have. You haven't the slightest proof of anything. But I have my certainty, and armed with that, I will go to your last parish, and the one before that if necessary. I'll find a parent. Trust me, Father Flynn, I will. You have no right to act on your own! You have taken vows, obedience being one! You answer to us! You have no right to step outside the church! I will step outside the church if that's what needs to be done, till the door should shut behind me! I will do what needs to be done, though I'm damned to Hell! You should understand that, or you will mistake me. Now, did you give Donald Miller wine to drink? - Have you never done anything wrong? - I have. A mortal sin? Yes. And? I confessed it, Father! Then whatever I have done, I have left in the healing hands of my confessor. As have you! We are the same! No, we are not, we are not the same! A dog that bites is a dog that bites! Did you give Donald Miller wine to drink? No. Mental reservation? No. You lie. Very well then. If you will not leave my office, I will. And once I go, I will not stop. Wait. I can't say everything, you understand? There's things I can't say. Even if you can't imagine the explanation, Sister, remember there are things beyond your knowledge. Even if you feel certainty, it is an emotion, not a fact. You will request a transfer, and take a leave of absence until it's granted. You'd leave me nothing. It's Donald Miller who has nothing, and you took full advantage of that. I've done nothing wrong. I care about that boy. Why? 'Cause you smile at him and you sympathize with him and you talk to him as if you were the same? You are a cheat. And that warm feeling you experienced, when that boy looked at you with trust, was not the sensation of virtue. That could be got by any drunkard with his tot of rum. - I can fight you. - You will lose. - Where's your compassion? - Nowhere you can get at it. Stay here. Compose yourself. You can use the phone if you like. Good day, Father. I have no sympathy for you. I know you are invulnerable to true regret. And cut your nails. I never like to say goodbye. But there is a wind behind every one of us that takes us through our lives. We never see it, we can't command it, we don't even know its purpose. I would have stayed among you longer, but that wind is taking me away. I will miss it here. And I will miss you. But I'm content that the power that propels me does so with superior knowledge as to what is for the best, and that is my faith. I would like to come down now among you and say goodbye, and wish you peaceful hearts and loving hearts. Goodbye, son. Happy holidays. Thank you. Thank you so much. God bless you. Good bye. - Sister James, welcome back. - Thank you, Sister. - You were missed. How is your brother? - Better. Much better. I'm very glad. I prayed for him. It was good to get away. I needed to see my family. Then I'm glad you did it. And Father Flynn is gone. Yes. So you did it. You got him out. Yes. Donald Miller is heartbroken. Can't be helped. It's just till June. I don't think Father Flynn did anything wrong. - No? He convinced you? - Yes, he did. - Did you ever prove it? - To whom? - Anyone but yourself? - Nope. - But you were sure. - Yes. I wish I could be like you. - Why? - Because I can't sleep anymore. Maybe we're not supposed to sleep so well. They made Father Flynn Pastor of Saint Jerome. Who? The Bishop appointed Father Flynn Pastor of Saint Jerome Church and School. It's a promotion. You didn't tell them? Oh, I told our good Monsignor. I crossed the garden and I told him. He did not believe it to be true. Then why did Father Flynn go? What did you say to make him leave? That I had called a nun in his previous parish. That I had found out his prior history of infringements. So you did prove it! I made no such call. - You lied? - Yes. But if he'd had no such history, the lie wouldn't have worked. His resignation was his confession. He was what I thought he was. And he's gone. I can't believe you lied. In the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God. Of course there is a price. I see. Oh, Sister James! What is it, Sister? I have doubts! I have such doubts!"
70,2009,The Slammin' Salmon,American,"""Slammin"" Cleon Salmon (Michael Clarke Duncan) is a former world heavyweight boxing champion who retired to open a sports-themed restaurant in Miami. His antics lead him to believe that he owes $20,000 to the head of the Japanese Yakuza. Needing to come up with the money in one night, he challenges the wait staff to sell more food than they have ever sold, with the top waiter receiving $10,000 in cash and the lowest waiter getting a ""broken ribs sandwich"" courtesy of the champ. Zany hijinks ensue as the staff try to one-up each other and win the prize while avoiding a beating. In the end, Cleon realizes that he only owed 20,000 Yen to the Japanese Yakuza (which works out to be $170) and shares the takings with the wait staff. But before he goes to give the Japanese Yakuza the money, he beats up Guy since he was the lowest selling waiter.",6.4,tt1135525,"And he's down. That's it! That's it. Cleon ""Slammin""' Salmon is still the Heavyweight Champion of the World. What a deadly punch. It's all over. Hi. Two? Hey, buddy. Do me a favor. My girlfriend don't like her tuna. - I'm sorry. - It's fine. What do you mean? You just said it was undercooked. - Tell the guy. - It's fine, Anthony. The guy is busy. Stacy, he's a monkey wrench. It's his job. Look. Let me get that for you. See? Just tell him what you want and he'll do it. - I'm not even that hungry. - You know what? Look, this is a little raw. Just put a little fire on it, all right, buddy? Sir, tuna is a very delicate fish. You think you're better than me? No, I don't think I'm better than you, sir. Well, you talk to me like I never ate a piece of fucking fish before. I'm sure you've had some fish before, sir. You know what? Tell the chef to cook it nice. And here, we need more butter. Okay. I will be right back. - Yeah, you will. - Thank you. Now we got no butter. Dave, can I get a re-fire? What did you just say to me? The guy on table wants it cooked a little bit more. No, they asked for it medium rare. It's perfect. If he wants it cooked more tell him to go shove it up his ass. You want me to tell that guy to cook this in his ass? Yeah, within the inside of his anus. - Come on, Dave. - Fine. Dave, come on. Fuck him if he doesn't know what medium rare is. Are you kidding me? When I said cook it nice, I didn't mean bring it back looking like a fucking turd. Sir, I actually do not cook the food. I am just a waiter. A smart guy. You want to get smart with me, smart guy? Great. What are you gonna do, kick his ass? Yeah, maybe I am. You want me to? Sure, go ahead. You always got to beat the shit out of the loser. Like the waiter at the Macaroni Grill, the waiter at the Olive Garden, the waiter at Buca di Beppo. Sir, here at the Slammin' Salmon there are no problems, just solutions. You know what? Here, you puck ass bitch. Here. You like that? How about some of that? Tell me what that tastes like. And you better say like shit. Like shit. Good, now get the fuck out of here and bring us some swordfish instead. I'll be right back. And you better not spit that out. Okay, I will not. Thank you. Up yours, you shit bird. You've got to be fucking fucking me. Were you just eating that piece of fish on the floor? You have no idea. This guy made me eat it. Really? A customer shoved the food in your mouth and told you you had to eat it? Yeah. He actually told me I couldn't spit it out too. Man, that's crazy. What? And I'm the Prime Minister of Narnia. You're paying for that piece of fish. It was a send back. Then you should have put it in the send back area. - You're paying for it. - You know what? Fuck this, Carl. I quit. Fine, but I'm not the one you have to tell. You've got to tell the Champ. And I know you don't have the guts to do it. All right then, I'll just leave. Screw the Champ. You really think you can walk out of here without telling the Champ? You remember Marty Millman? Marty Millman is breathing through a hole in his throat right now. Rich, he will find you and ass fuck you in the face or in the mouth. Fine. Fine, I'll tell him to his face. - Okay, fine. - I'll tell him myself. - Okay, go for it. - I'm gonna go right now. - Okay, good luck. - I'm not afraid of him. - Okay, bye-bye. - I'll see you soon. - We'll be here. - Carl. In his face, right? Shit. Fuck it. Fuck this. Hey, Carl. Rich Parente is not a quitter. Guess we ain't getting our swordfish. Dude, last night was sick. I was rolling with my boys down at Club Merengue and they called last call. So I reminded them it's now daylight savings and we got an extra hour. And in that hour I had Smirnoff Ices... and I walked out of there with a Bangladeshi hooker. I banged her deshi all night long. Where'd you go pimping last night, playboy? I too had a wild night last night. I made sweet hot love to an orangutan. Really? A bachelor party? - Yeah. - What'd it smell like? - Bananas mostly. - Really? Guy, I'm pulling your leg. I did not fuck an orangutan last night. I have student teacher evaluations coming up. Keep going, playboy. I'm listening. - There's one kid who-- - Hey. So, did you hear who's coming back tonight? Yeah, Connor. God, I can't believe it. Can you imagine being the star of a TV show and then having to come back and wait tables? I know. It's humiliating. Hey, do you think you guys will get it on again? Yeah right. He should be so lucky. You don't get bites of the apple, especially when it's Golden Delicious. Yeah. - Chow down. - Yes! I'm starving. What you pigs are eating is the blackened cod. It comes with rosemary mashed potatoes and tempura mushrooms. It's blackened because-- hey! It's blackened because I bought pieces last Tuesday and it's gone bad. I'll give a free dessert to whoever sells the most of this shit. - You bitch. - Guys. I hate to be a ball buster, but somebody was toking marijuana in the coat checkroom last night and that is a big no no never. Rich, you put me on for a double tomorrow. You said you needed money for ballet school. I do, but I also told you that I'd get shin splints if I work a double. - You're right. I'm sorry. - That's right. Shin splints, okay, you're right. I will change that right away. Who the hell is that? That's our new busboy. Donnie, could you come over here, please? Donnie is Dave's twin brother. Straighten your fucking bow tie. No, you went too far. Back. I'll warn you guys now, he's a complete retard. - I told you not to call me that. - You what? - I said you're the retard. - You're the retard! - You're the retard. - You're the retard. - You're the re-- - Shut up! - Weird. - Donnie Kanogi, hi. - You a douchebag like your brother? - No, I-- - Donnie Kanogi. - Tara. Don't worry about it. My sister's a dick too. I get it. Ladies and gentlemen, straight from TV land, our old friend Connor Rhodes! What's up? What's up? I missed each and every one of you. Look at him. Look at this guy. - Hey. - There you go. We watched you every single Sunday for weeks. Hot stuff. Dude! You did get a nose job. No, no, my hair is longer and it makes my face look tiny. We noticed it looked smaller on TV but we thought it was makeup. It's strange, I know, but the camera actually takes lbs off your nose. I think you took lbs off your nose. Nice one, Dick P. But seriously, I did not get a nose job. Hey, true to form, you're an hour late. - Nuh. Daylight savings. - Then you should be an hour early. Pretty good. All right, everybody, hit the floor. Let's have a big night tonight. Let's see some pep in that step. - Let's do it. - I'm Donnie. - Welcome back. - Thank you. Nice to see you. - Good to see you. - You look good. - You do too. - How are you doing? Frosty. So are you gonna be all right with this? Yeah yeah. Well, you know, I spent a shitload of cash I didn't have. So... got to eat. Go to work. - Okay. Working? - Yeah. So what, you like quit to be on a TV show? Yeah yeah, I got a lead role on ""CFI Hotlanta."" - No way. - Yeah. Connor walked out of here in a blaze of glory. Yeah! Yeah! I'm famous! I'm famous! Cole slaw never tasted so good. Fucking big nose. Suck it. Eat a dick. Eat a dick. Suck it. Lick it. Stick it. Double dick it. And fuck you! - Cole slaw! - Yeah. They killed me off after episodes. - How come? - Because every time he came on TV America threw up in their mouths just a little bit. Yes. Actually, it's because the actress who plays the police commissioner and I took a little trip to Ejacuidor together. Wait. Isn't that Morgan Fairchild? It is Morgan Fairchild. - What? - All right. - Dude! - She's hot! But the creator of the show, this guy named Dick Lobo, got jealous and suddenly Detective Shep Winford would up dead in a petting zoo with the killer's sperm in his shoes. Wait, his sperm was in your shoe? Whatever, dude. Tell us about Morgan Fairchild. Was she wet? Was she dry? Did she laugh? Did she cry? All right, day one of shooting, Morgan Fairchild is giving me the stink eye something fierce. At the end of the day she says, ""I want to see you in my trailer."" So I knock on the door, open it up and go in and Morgan Fairchild is wearing the tiniest piece of lingerie. I mean, it's not even lingerie. It's like Silly String. - What color? - See-through. - See-through? - Like a spider web. That's so hot. She says, ""I've got a little welcome present for you."" Takes out a gift wrapped box, opens it, reaches in and pulls out, and I shit you not, the biggest, blackest-- - Welcome to Slammin' Salmon. - Thank you. - Just one? - Just one. - No, no, no. - Not my section. Not my section. - He's definitely coming back. - No he's not. No, no, no... Damn it! You do not seat person at a top. Sorry, Guy. Can you please wait until I get back to finish that story? - I can't wait. - No dice, Jim Rice. - Come on. - They've spoken, Guy. God! Shit. All right, she reaches in and pulls out, and I shit you not... Hey, sport. How are you? Welcome to the Slammin' Salmon. I'm Guy. Well, hello, Guy. I'm Horace, and thank you. No! Sounds like someone told a great story. Yes it does. Connor, I just sat you. Welcome back. It's good we didn't get a booth. Don't forget your Slammin' Salmon smile. Is that a real thing? - Do I need to know that? - Yeah. Honey, I'm not hungry. Can we just split a couple things? Hi, welcome to the Slammin' Salmon. - Okay. - My God, I know you. - Really? - Yeah, I definitely know you. - Where do I know you from? - Maybe he's in your spinning class. - He looks like a spinner. - Honey, he's not a spinner. God, it's driving me crazy. I know I've seen you somewhere before. Is it from TV do you think? Yes, I've got it. Yeah, you waited on me last time I was here. Duh. Well, I left for a while to be one of the leads on ""CFI Hotlanta."" No way. I'm the black woman from ""Law  Order,"" so... - You're so funny. - Thanks. - I'll have a Merlot. - Dry Sack, rocks. Ladies and gentlemen, from Hell's Kitchen, New York, the Doctor of Destruction, the Captain of Crunch, the Heavyweight Champion of the World, Slammin' Cleon Salmon. Thank you. I hope you find the seafood to be succulent. And if you need anything, anything at all, remember-- ding-- ring the bell. And come back soon, or else I'll ring your bell. Look at that. You've been working out. Let's see. Come here. Yeah. Okay. Nuts, I need a drink. 200 for a babysitter? I mean, come on, that's a lot of money. No, you're totally worth it. I know how much you love Norah Jones. I love her too. I bought the tickets. Front row seats. ""Don't Know Why""? Round 1. My God. I've got to go. I love you. Well, if it isn't the King of Siam. - Make yourself at home. - Okay. Hey, Champ. Didn't mean to sit in your chair. Sorry about that. I'm just being humorous. But I do want to talk about something serious. Are you familiar with Japanese albino hunting? Can't say that I am, no. My God, it is all the rage in Japan right now. What they do is they set a bunch of Japanese albinos loose in the forest and you hunt them. And you shoot them? No, no, it's just for sport. Strictly catch and release. Who is it?! Round 1. Your drink, Champ. Crazy straw. That's good. So my first time hunting these albinos an albino ran right past me. I got so nervous I smacked him in the head and almost depacitated him. Whatever, motherfucker! Round 1. Now where was I? You were talking about Japanese albino hunting. Yeah. So I bet the head of the Yakuza grand that I could catch more albinos than him. I mean, look at me, come on. I'm an athlete. Well, you know what? I got my ass kicked. And now I've got to pay him grand by tomorrow. Sounds like someone has to go to the ATM machine. Yeah, you would think that. But I'm a little cash-poor right now. I bought some land on the moon next to John Travolta. Smart. Real estate is a very safe investment. So here's what you've got to do for me. I need you to make grand tonight or else these guys are gonna come and take the restaurant. Champ, the most the restaurant has ever made in one night is grand. I don't care. I wish you would have told me. I would have had more waiters on tonight. I wish Nino Gutierrez would have told me he was gonna sock me with a hard right in the Fracas in Caracas. And now look at him. He's dead. I can see that. So figure it out. If you don't get me grand by tonight I'm gonna lose the restaurant. If I lose the restaurant I'm gonna be mad. And if I'm mad I'm gonna beat the shit out of you and break all your arms. Champ, I'm gonna need those arms. I got kids. All the more reason to keep it open. Okey-dokey? Okey-dokey. I'm gonna skedaddle. I'll be back to check on you later. Round 1. Oh, boy. Everybody listen up, please. Hello, everyone listen to me, please. Champ wants a big night tonight. So he is offering a prize to the top selling waiter. - Is it cash? - It's not cash, but it's something better. What, a blowjob from your mother? No, no, it's not a blowjob from my mother, okay? The prize for the top selling waiter, front row seats to the Norah Jones concert this week. My God! I love Norah Jones. My God. - Right? Right? - Sweet, I'm in. Are you serious? You like Norah Jones? No, she's a slag. But think of all the tang that's gonna be at that show. I'll be up to my elbows in tang. Like a fucking astronaut. With a space helmet on. You're a weird fucking dude. You know that? I am so gonna win this. Do tips count? Tips count. Champ loves great service, right? Okay, give me your tips as you get them and I'll post it up on the board, okay? - All right. - Now everyone, get out there and move some fish. I've never lost at anything in my life. Look at this good-looking group of men. So are you boys hungry? Starving. Well you know what they say about a man with a big appetite. It's all true. Good. 'Cause you know what? You're gonna have the 4-lb lobster tonight. - Okay. - Okay? And so are you. And you. I just have to tell you, I am a huge fan. ""Dogs of the Sahara"" is a perfect movie. And your acting in it is sick. Like hospital sick. Thanks, man. I appreciate it. Seriously, I think you discovered, like, a new emotion in that movie. Really? I didn't know. Thanks again. Well, what kind of emotion? Well, you know, it's like he's like brave but naïve. You know? Like braive. Okay. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Sorry, I never do this. - What's your name, pal? - I'm Connor. - Connor, I'm Marlon. And this is my girlfriend Samara Dubois. I read ""US Weekly."" I know who this is. The interior designer who stole your heart. That's right. I hired her to decorate my chill chalet. She said, ""First things first. You should just call it a 'chilet.""' I fell in love with her right then and there. I just put the words together. Chilet. I love that. New guy. Sorry. - So what's this? - Little tradition here at the Salmon. Anytime a busboy breaks something he does a shot of Blue Curacao. Is it cool to drink on the job? Do you need to ask your big brother for permission? Do you want to try shaving with this? Okay, yeah, let's see. I'm older by hours. Hi-yaa! And don't worry. No one will ever know. Cool. - Hey, Conman. - Mr. Spencer. I was wondering if you could help me out. My God, this is really sudden. I'm proposing to Samara tonight. Somebody finally put a saddle on you, bronco? Yeah. When we order dessert, could you put the ring in it so she can find it? Yeah yeah yeah. Let's get her drunk so she says yes. That's a custom-made ring, yeah? It's safe with me. You have my word. Cool. - Send back - Out of the way. It's a dessert. - Somebody sent back a dessert. - My God. When somebody sends back a dessert you've got to move fast. They're like wild jackals at their mother's teat. I've got to get lemons. Tara, will you watch my section? - Yup. - This is good! What's up, Mamma Mia? The old follow me down to the walk-in fridge game? Frankly, I didn't expect to see you here at the Salmon again. Yeah, well, I figure I'm here or months tops. And then I'm moving to California to do some modeling. Well, don't you have to be like tall, muscular and really hot to model? No, no, not anymore. You'd be amazed what they can do with CGI these days. Right. I like the new nose, by the way. It's so funny that you all think that. 'Cause it's the same nose it always was. Really? - Want to take a closer look? - I just might. - You fucking love it. - Yeah. My God! Yes! - So fucking hot. - Yeah. You know what? I'm not your tickle friend anymore. Well, you are saying no but a couple of your friends are saying yes. It's cold in here, asshole. Why do they call you Nuts? Because I'm crazy. You don't look crazy. I'm insane. You should see me without my meds. At my last job, I didn't take my meds one day, hour later I was walking around naked with peanut butter in my hair telling people my name was Zongo. I delivered an old lady a cup of hot water with my balls in it. Yeah, talk about your Red Zinger. Yeah, but I don't remember any of it. My balls were red though. - Are you serious? - Totally. No, I'm joking. But it is true. Sir. Are you ready to order your entree? I haven't even looked at the menu. That's my party people. Yeah! Hey, all right. You've been here for an hour, sir. Surely you must be hungry. I am. I'll take a look. In the meantime, I'll have a drink. Tell me, Guy, what goes well with Tolstoy? Dom Perignon, Cristal, perhaps a Chateau Margaux, or even a Rothschild. Well, I'll take all 4. - Really? - No. I'll just have a cup of hot water with a wedge of lemon. Living on the edge. - No, here. - Hold on, hold on. Come on. Jesus. Nuts, you fucker. Dick P, a little help? - What are you guys doing? - Dicking around, bro. - Yahtzee! - What are you doing with the booze? Donnie, leave us. Grab me an olive from the bar, please. Dave Kanogi's brother. I'm hazing the shit out of him, dude. Maybe you should be selling the shit out of the food, dude. - Tara. - Yes? You love Norah Jones. I mean, ""Come Away With Me."" You love that song. I've heard you humming it. Yes, I also hum the Macarena. It doesn't mean I want to go to the Macarena concert. - Snap. - Well, Norah Jones is different. I mean, she's cool and folksy and jazzy. Come on. Rich, look, I'm in medical school, okay? I don't have time to go to a concert. - What about you? - I'm not sure who Norma Jones is. - Is she the puppeteer? - No. Here's the thing. Norah Jones is for chicks and weepy dorks like you. If I'm gonna make the Champ richer, I want a real prize. Till then, you tell him to go fuck a cow. - What's up? - Snap! Hey, retards, you want to answer the phone? I'll do it. I'm only the manager. Good evening. Persuasions Spa and Casino Resort. I'm Stanley Bellin. How may I persuade you? Hey, Stanley. It's Rich Parente calling on behalf of Cleon Salmon. Yeah, the Champ would like to book his regular suite. I'm afraid the suite is not available for Mr. Salmon. What do you mean? Why not? 'Cause last time Mr. Salmon's pet kangaroo defecated in our kitchen. Well, that kangaroo is no longer with us. The Champ actually killed him during a sparring session. I'm so sorry to hear that. Unfortunately I will have to politely say no. Is that Stanley? - Let me talk to him. - Don't tell him it's me. Just-- Yes, Champ. It's Stanley Bellin. Fuck. Tell him I said I want the Emperor Suite or I'm gonna shove his ass up his ass. Of course Mr. Salmon can stay in the Emperor Suite. I was merely joking. Tell him to make the reservation under King Kamehameha. All right, Kamehameha. How many Ms? And it better be free or I'm gonna knock Stanley into Bolivian. Yeah, he said that he was hoping it would be free or he was gonna knock you into Bolivian. But I think he means oblivion. Whatever, motherfucker! It'll be free. It'll be free. Guys, listen up. New deal, okay? Champ is very serious about selling big tonight. So there's a new prize. A 4-day, 3-night stay at the Persuasions Spa and Casino Resort Hotel in Key Largo. - That sounds awesome. - Really? Wait a minute, is that the gay key? It's the straight key, Guy. What if he wanted the gay key? Why would I want the gay key? - I thought you said you... - All right, listen listen listen. It's a great prize. Come on. Persuasions Spa and Casino Resort Hotel. - That's awesome. - Hell yeah, Dick P. Here are the current standings, okay? Nuts, Tara, let's pick it up a notch, okay? Enthusiasm! My suggestion to you guys, sell the cod. One of the most expensive items on the menu. 38.95, okay? Let's get out there and turn 'em and burn 'em. All right? Come on, sell some cod. Well, you have got to try the cod. Is it fishy? I don't really like fishy fish. No, no, no. The cod is the least fishy of the fishes. It's so unfishy it's not even classified as a fish. I'll take one. Do yourself a favor, order the cod. Is it a fishy fish? I like my fish fishy. Cod is definitely the fishiest fish there is. And a fishy fish is a healthy fish. Did you know that cod is a flying fish? It's flying off the shelf tonight. Is it flakey? I like flakey. Very flakey. The Eskimo name for cod is actually ponacana which means flake fish. It's a rare Moroccan midget cod. It's almost impossible to catch so the portions are tiny. You might want to get per person. Moroccan midget cod? I've heard of that. It's really good. I usually don't swear at my tables, but you people look really cool. So it's fucking delicious. We'll get fucking each. Good order. Hey! - I've got to ask you something. - Okay. Were you on ""CFI Hotlanta""? Yeah, I was. I knew it. I said you were on ""The Bachelorette,"" dude. Well, they're both good shows, I suppose. I love both of those shows. Hey, Conman, when you're ready, I think we're ready for desert. We'll have a brownie, one scoop of vanilla ice cream and spoons. Carbs. Yeah, I will get that right out to you. You know, oysters are an aphrodisiac. More oysters, more aphrodisia. That is if you guys think you're gonna get lucky tonight. I probably will. What's up, boys? Did you dirty ho-daddies wish this perfect angel a happy birthday yet? It's your birthday? Yeah. Where's your birthday suit? Stop. - You're so bad. - I can be worse. Donnie, have you ever noticed that redheaded people breathe through their mouths? Like orangutans? Yeah, exactly like orangutans. Coincidence? Happy birthday? Donnie, leave us. Bring me a cocktail onion from the bar, please. What can I say? I thought I'd help you get a big tip. Just like the old days. And while we're at it... I accept. You know, if you and I work together, we will definitely win this Key Largo prize. No. Come on, Mia. Why are you being so difficult? I want my tickle friend back. You do? Rich? Something's stuck. Jesus Christ, there was a diamond ring in that brownie. It was in the send back area. It was up for grabs. - You said it was a send back. - I said I want my tickle friend back. What the fuck is a tickle friend? Cough it up. Come on! I'm not choking. I swallowed it. Get it out. Clam chowder for the gentleman. 1, 2, 3. The salmon and haricots verts for the lady. 1, 2, 3. Soup spoon. 1, 2, 3. Is there anything else I can get you this evening? I think we're fine for now. Thank you. 1, 2, 3. Enjoy your wine. Dude, it's heading down to Funkytown. I can't feel it anymore. - What is that thing? - It's a stud finder. Stud finder? Sounds like a gay dating service. Heyoo! Can we just get the ring, please? - Tara. - What? We need medical help. Rich just swallowed a really important diamond ring. Is it still in the esophagus? Okay, well, it's too deep to expunge by vomiting. It could tear the esophageal tissue on its way up. After all, it is a diamond. Hardest substance known to man! Look, my advice-- you have to pass it anally. - Shit. - Hope it doesn't turn into coal. Dude, you better pray it doesn't fork off into your dick. Ouch. Nuts, what was with that counting thing at the table? Counting? Did you take your meds today? Meds? Yeah, 3:30. Took 'em before I came here. Next one is at 8:30. Right now. Wait, did you account for daylight savings? Daylight savings. No. No. Well, that means that your body actually thinks it's 9:30. You were supposed to take your meds an hour ago. Not good. Okay, look, why don't you take them and I'll watch your section? Yeah. Probably all those cock rings jangling around in there. Nuts, Nuts, Nuts, where are you going? I've got to get something out of the coat room. Just take a second. Can you watch these guy's tables? I got a diamond ring in me, man. That's all right. I'll get it later. - Was he just skipping? - What? - Was he just skipping? - Pig in a poke. Let's get back to work. I think I got a pretty good bead on a lunch box. What's up, buddy? Okay, there's been a bit of a snag. Okay, what? Someone ate your engagement ring. You're fucking with me. That's good. No. I put the ring in the brownie and I turned my back for just one second and a member of the staff ate the brownie. You stupid cock. That was a 450,000 South African Bing diamond. I want to speak to the manager and the asshole who ate it now. Did you know some dumb fuck ate my ring? Yes, sir. And I'm terribly sorry about that. So what are you gonna do about it? I'm trying to pass it. - Come again? - I'm trying to pass it. Anally. Coffee, cigarettes, laxatives. - It was you? - Yes, it was. That was a 450,000 South African Bing diamond you just ate. Your meal is on the house tonight. Screw the meal. If you don't fuck out that shitting diamond and fast I'm gonna kick your ass. And Conster, there will be a sequel to that. Como se dice ""Cleveland steamer""? Don't worry about it. Yo, Dave. No, don't even say it. The woman said it's cold. - It's steaming. - I know. Fucking customers. I mean, I told her to cook with her ass and then go fuck herself but she insisted. I like you, Guy. Jamie, nuke the dick out of it. Si, señor. Hey, what's that blue shit on your lips? Nothing. - Blue Curacao. - Are you drunk? Asshole, I got you this fucking job. You screw this up, I'm telling Mom. No! Come on, Señor Dave, get him! Get him, Dave. Come on, man. I'm gonna stick your fucking face in the oven. I fucking hate you! Come on, señor! Twins are disgusting, man. Want me to put your head in the oven? 'Cause I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm sorry. The kitchen just told me we're out of the brownies. So would you like the soufflé instead? It takes an hour to prepare. I don't think that we actually need-- - We'll take it. - Honey. Now tell me all about your plans for the living room. Okay, where is my boyfriend and what did you do with him? Okay, think pillows. - I'll leave you two alone. - Starting with the bathtub... Thank you. I'm a ballerina, you know? And I'm putting myself through the Bilitnikoff Ballet School. Well, you certainly got the body for it. And it stretches in every direction. Here's a little something extra for the Sugar Plum Fairy. Thank you. What are you looking at, Liz? - You are so winning this contest. - Yeah. Shit! Don't cry. It's gonna look fine. Gently, gently, gently. This looks all right. Was this a cream-based soup? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. I think so. - Does that make a difference? - Sometimes. Okay, well, it looks like first-degree burns. It could lead to some epidermal scarring. I want you to go home and get some rest and drink plenty of water. I am not going home. I'm in first place. Hey, that's the spirit, Mia. Get out there. What? Rich, no. Look, she needs to rest and put some ichthammol or sulfadiazine on her face. Yeah, Rich, she needs ichthioldizine. Thank you, Donnie. At least someone here has a heart. - Thank you. - All right. You guys are right. You're right. Mia, you should go home. Did Baryshnikov go home when he twisted his ankle at the Bolshoi Festival? I... Did Vladimir Putinski walk away when he sprained his toe doing ""The Marzipan King"" at the Ballet des Elysées? I'm guessing by your tone, no. Okay, did Joe Theesman quit baseball when he broke his leg? It's actually Joe Theismann, and he never played football again. Either way, I am tougher than you are, motherfucker. What's that? No, shit. Okay, I'll be back. - Look, Mia, just sit down, okay? - Yeah, yeah. Don't touch. The Captain of Crunch, the Heavyweight Champion of the World, Slammin' Cleon Salmon. You've got to be kidding me. I am here. Undefeated, baby. - The king is here. - You're number 1. How you doing? Come here and give me a hug. You look good. Hey, get a carrot for the SS Fudgealicious, okay? I assume that's the horse? Never assume. When you assume you make an asshole out of yourself. All right, thank you. Go back to eating. Enjoy yourselves. Forget it. It's not about me. Hey, Rich, tell Dave to cook that swordfish. I won it from Emeril Lagasse in a thumb-wrestling contest. I broke this thumb. He cried like a baby. Hey, look, me and Mr. Yamamuri, we want the best seat in the house. We want the royal treatment, Rich. Champ, you can't. I mean, we need those tables if you want to earn the grand. That's nice, Rich. Check this out. If you don't find me a table, I'm gonna shove him up your ass. Champ, isn't he Yakuza? Come on, man. Don't be racist. No, he's not Yakuza. Mr. Yamamuri is gonna make the first Slammin' Salmon candy bar in Japan. Check it out-- a layer of chocolate, nougat, peanut, more nougat and salmon. Yeah, I know it sounds nasty, but trust me. They love that fish candy over in the Orient. Now I'm saying that to say this: shut the fuck up, get me a table, or I'm gonna use your nuts for cufflinks. - Coming right up. Great. - All right. - Candy bar sounds delicious. - It is. - Okay, be right back. - All right. You're gonna love this waitress. She's a ballerina. Graceful like a swan. Tell Mr. Yamamuri. Hey, Champ. What the fuck happened to you? I got burned with soup. Don't you know you're supposed to blow on it first? Yes, Champ. Well, don't just stand there. Get out of here, soupface. You're offending my Tokyokan guest. - Get me the smart girl. - Tara? - Yeah. - Yeah, I'm gonna get her for you. And tell her to bring me some champagne. I am so sorry, but her soupface scared the shit out of me. My voice is not that high. This says hours. I need something faster. I hear eye-drops work on some people. One glass of apple juice and I can fill up a mailbox. - Yogurt. - Cheddar cheese. Tara, the Champ wants you to wait on him. Okay. - Cause of the... - Yeah. Right. Mr. Yamamuri say he think if Muhammad Ali was still young man no one ever defeat him. Yeah, well, if ifs and buts was candies and nuts, we'd all have a merry Christmas. Tell him that. No, I didn't say that. If ifs and buts was candies and nuts, we'd all have a merry Christmas. Yes, Champ-san. - I translate-- - Say it! If if and but was candy and nut, we all have a merry Christmas. Thank you. Was that so hard? Hey, Champ. Dave, what did you do? Did you blow Papa Smurf? Blow Papa Smurf. We got a couple of stiffs over here. Champ, would you like to order some appetizers? Yes, I would like to order some encrapments. I will have the frutti del mare, the oysters del cabana and the clams casino. And for the entree I want that swordfish that I caught. And Dave, make sure you cook the nose too. I want to see what that tastes like. You got that, Dave? And I want maraschino cherries on everything. Did you know that the word maraschino came from the boxer Rocky Maraschino? It's actually Rocky Marciano. Whatever, motherfucker! Okay. Okay. Okay. How do you say motherfucker in Spanish? Most guys go surf 'n' turf. But I like a guy who goes surf 'n' surf 'n' turf 'n' turf. You know, actually, could you give us a minute? And we will call you when we need you. You men always say you're gonna call. Okay, actually I'm just trying to keep my appetite here. But thank you... for groping me and bringing your face into our dinner. These are the days I thank God I have a perfect face. Sorry. Hey, you. So I'm gonna take you up on your offer about working as a team. I don't know. I think I would drag you down. No. Best of luck to you. Get it out of the soup! Get it out of the soup! Will somebody please kill this thing?! He's strong! He's strong! What the fuck is taking so long? You have to dominate the swordfish. Only then can you sauté it. Thanks, Champ. Rich, numbers! Here you go. Are we at grand yet? We're at 12,000. That's not even halfway. - Actually... - In my office! Everybody in my office! No, no, no, not the customers. You guys sit down. Wait staff in my office. So I guess nobody wants this trip to the Bahamas. It's actually Key Largo, Champ. Persuasions. You know what? Don't say another word. 'Cause you've proven yourself useless, wouldn't you say? Say it. I am useless with a capital Y. I am useless with a capital Y. That's right. Now then, when I was in your position, I would have rabbit-punched my own mother for a trip to the Bahamas. Are you telling me you wouldn't want to be on a beach right now sipping on a strawberry daiquiri? - I would like that very much. - Well, too bad! 'Cause strawberry daiquiris are for closers! Not for pussies! Hey, numbnuts. Yeah, Champ? You're gonna be polishing my fist with your teeth. I'll get to you later. Who is Guy ""Meatdrapes""? What kind of name is that? It's Metdrapedes, sir. It's Greek. Well, I think you're pronouncing it wrong. This says ""Meatdrapes."" It's actually pronounced Metdrapedes. Well, why doesn't it sound like that when I say it? ""Meatdrapes."" I don't know. You don't know much, do you, Guy? No, sir. Well, if a trip to the Bahamas ain't gonna get the molasses out ya asses, maybe 10,000 will do the trick. - What? - What? - 10,000 bucks? - That's right, new prize. Top waiter leaves here tonight with grand in his pocket. Do you know what grand feels like in your pocket? It feels like a third cock. Jesus, how many cocks you got, Champ? Are you lampooning me, Meatdrapes? No, of course not, sir. - You want a punch in the eye, Guy? - No, please. I can make your face look like a pie, Guy. God, no. Excuse me. I didn't mean to do that. But now you know the deal. The waiter that comes in first place gets 10,000. Whoever comes in last gets a broken rib sandwich. And I wasn't even trying to hurt him. - Are you about to cry, Guy? - No, of course not. Loosen up your tie, Guy. Did you hear what I just said? It was a rhyme. If you're not gonna cry, then put it in his eye. Punch to the gut and make him smell like a skunk. If he runs out of meat then he's... So what are you all staring at? Don't nobody want 10,000? Get the hell out of here now! Bullshit, big nose, it's already over. Champ, I don't mean to tell you your business, but if you have to make grand tonight and you give away 10, it works counter to what you're trying to do. Richardo, believe it or not, I ain't a numbers man. I punch people for a living. And I'm gonna punch you if you don't make that money tonight. Okay, that's good math. I'm on it. - You really mean that? - Yeah, I do. That is so cool. It's that couple's 20th wedding anniversary. Really? They look so young. Well, they've been married since they were 16. Can you believe? That's amore. Gordon, send those kids a bottle of champagne. Apparently they've been married for years. But she didn't want to get pregnant until the cancer went into remission. Well, it went into remission last week. Will you send them a bottle of your best champagne? On us, of course. - It'd be my pleasure. - Thank you. You see that man over there? He's the one who pulled me from the burning car. He's my hero. After years in a wheelchair, he walked into her arms. It was ""Oprah""'s highest rated episode. And they're sitting right over there. I am gonna stuff it in your ass tonight. Well, that's gonna be an extra bucks. That's okay. Shellfish makes me horny. - Good, 'cause I got crabs. - Who doesn't? Excuse me, sir. Compliments of the house. What is this, some kind of hidden camera thing? - Are you miked? - Are you miked? I was just kidding about the anal. I was just bored at the hotel. I was looking for something to do with my cock. Perfectly natch. Come on, take a look at her. You wouldn't kick in that back door? - I'm not ashamed. - Fuck this! Yeah, Guy. Number with a bullet. Congratulations. Burn. I would like to see you try and sell with a burnedface, Sucks to be you, Hiroshima. grand! I got my eye on a leather couch with a velvet dick hole in it. Yeah? Well, check out the scoreboard. You got to get by me first, fake 'n' bake. - See ya. - I am going to own this. Hi there. Hey. Is that Norma Jones? That's Nutella the pop star. Yeah, you take Norah Jones, Fergie and Beyoncé and mix 'em together, you get Nutella. Who's Beyoncé? - Nutella, Nutella. - There he is. Good to see you. Nutella thinks it's always good to see you too, Champ. Give 'em the best seat in the house. Thank you, baby. Y'all see all that chocolate? - I know, I love chocolate. - I heard that. - Right this way. - All right. - Perfect, that table. - Come on. - Thank you. - Yes! Come on. - Hey, sexy Patty. - Hey. Hey, if you give me the best tables for the rest of the night I'll take you to Persuasions with me. I thought you were taking Mia. No, I would rather take you-a. My God, you are so funny. You've got a great sense of humor. You have great posture. I used to have scoliosis. You can't tell. Good evening, Miss Nutella. We are so honored to have you with us tonight. Can I just say that I love your song ""Too Sincere For You""?  For you... It's up here. Got it. Nutella thanks you, baby. Now can we order fast? 'Cause Nutella is hungry. Of course. So what should we have? Well, the Champ ordered bottles of Cristal, lobsters troubadour, an Alaskan king crab, oysters carbonara and a round of swordfish. Well, we will take of that. - Fantastic. - You treat Nutella right, Nutella treats you right. - I know what you're saying, girlfriend. - All right, girl. - Okay, right. - Show 'em what you're working with. Okay, great. There we go. No. What? What are you doing? - Why am I on the board? - I am giving you a section. Congratulations, you are in the competition. What are you talking about? I'm a busboy. - You were a busboy. - Get your hands off me. But now you're a waiter. No, I don't know the first thing about waiting tables. It's very simple. You ask the people what they want, and then you bring it to them. A monkey could do it. I'm hours behind these guys and I'm shitfaced. - Bring those tables out. - No, no, no! Great, stick them wherever they fit. Please don't do this. Rock shrimp and scallop linguini. Stay close to the shitter. I call it my pants down pasta. Be sure to eat all the cream. Hey, douchebag. Dave, you've got to tell the guy I'm a fuck-up, yeah? No, no, no, you'll do great. You made it through months of college. - Come on, Dave. - Sounds like waiter material to me. This is delicious. I hope the Champ knocks every tooth out of your fucking head. I hope the Champ knocks your tooth out. Shots, shots, shots. Come on, get it into ya. Hello, gentlemen, and welcome to the Salmon Slammin'. My name is Donnie. Can I start you off with something to drink tonight? We've already got some drinks, haven't we, mate? Sounds like you're from the UK. Are you in a band like Oasis or Herman's Hermits? No, we're not. Are there any answers I can question you from the menu tonight? All right, Donnie, why don't you tell us something good on the menu? Well, the Blue Curacao is excellent. Private joke. Just get us some more shots, all right? Then I will just clear these shot glasses out of the way for you. Hey, hey! You fucking cunt. I'm not drunk. So how is everything tonight? Truly splendid, Guy. Thank you. Well, we're really really busy tonight. Yes, I can see that. So is there anything else I can get for you tonight or just the check? Well, I wouldn't mind a cup of tea. Get the fuck out of here. Excuse me? Are you reading ""War and Peace""? Get the fuck out of here. I love that book. Well, perhaps you'd like to come to my book club. Yeah, last week we read Flaubert's ""Madame Bovary."" It really brought the... house down. Hey, kid. I like you. I think they put you in a really tough situation. I'm gonna help you out and give you one of my tables. Really? Thanks. Yeah, see Donald Trump over there? Knock yourself out. Connor. I just sat you a 6. 6. Thanks, Patty. So you just keep whacking him in the knee. Painful, but better than a punch in the face. - Connor? - Hey, Morgan. Hi. You remember Dick Lobo, - the producer of ""CFI Hotlanta."" - Hey. Of course. And the entire rest of the cast. Yeah, Ron, Mary Kay, Jojo. What are you guys doing here? We're in town to shoot this fabulous crossover promo with ""CFI Miami."" Cool. You know, somebody suggested that if I was in Miami this is the place to come. That was me. Right. Right. Yeah, so what are you doing here? You researching a role for TV or something? Not really. I actually just work here. So... Keeping it real. - Good for you, dog. - All right. Okay. So can I get you all started off with something to drink? I told myself I wasn't going to put my thumbprint into every dessert and yet... That's impossible. I never touched that one. You know you're gonna have to start over now. I know. I told myself I wasn't going to put... This is undefeated, you are-- should be depleted. When you go against me you're gonna be needing a paramedic. P-a-r-a-dic. Paramedic. Zongo's in the house! Hey, he's onto something. You guys see Nuts? I want all the wait staff skipping just like Nuts now. God damn it, I said now! Skip! Skip, everybody! Keep skipping. Keep skipping. If you're in one place, hop up and down. - There you go, man. - You doing all right? Skip it like you mean it! Keep skipping! What the fuck?  Tempura  It's delicious. That's great. I love it. We'll take all of it. - Nuts, Nuts, come here. - Tara, Tara, Tara. Rich, he's over the edge. We have to help him. Let it slide. He's selling like crazy. - You don't care? - I totally care. Rich, look at him. He's totally out of control. That doesn't bother you? - Keep up the good work, okay? - Rich, come on. Something's wrong. If you need anything ask for Zongo. In second place is Connor. And in first place, NutsZongo. - Nuts is in first? Jesus Christ. - What? Rich, he's bazonkers. Get him off the floor. - Yeah. - Look, aren't we all a little bazonkers? Rich, why are you doing this? Is it because of the Champ? That's ridiculous. We have a job to do. Nuts and Zongo should at least count as different people. - I agree. - Yes. Look, if it's any consolation, you're all really close together. Except for you, Donnie. My God. Excuse me. I've got to go. - Got to be an asshole about this. - I ain't losing to some lunatic. If you don't like mauve we can totally do some kind of texture mosaic finger-painting. Excuse me. I just wanted to let you know that the chef is pushing out your dessert from the oven. It'll just be a few minutes. Well, that is fantastic, Detective Shep Winford. Now why don't you track me down another drink? And tell them to put some booze in it this time, yeah? Coming right up. - Are you sure you want another one? - Yes. Maybe a virgin rum and Coke. - That would just be Coke. - That sounds delicious. What's up, noodle dicks? That table over there just ordered rounds of premium tequila. Now are y'all just gonna sit here while they make you look like a bunch of fucking pussies? Hell no, dude. We'll take rounds. Shit yeah! What are y'all, Phi Taus? - Phi Taus! - Come on now, give it to me. - Give it to me good. - Let's take him down. - I know where he keeps his meds. - Yeah. I want some booze in my belly. Yeah, baby! Fidel, this is for a pissed-off movie star, so give it some balls. Yeah. Do it. Go and go. That's what I'm talking about. Hola, diablo blancos. Zongo like vodka. Hey. hey, you doing okay, Zongo? Hello, Zongo. You've got to take it, Zongo. Nobody puts Zongo in a cage. No one's trying to put Zongo in a cage, Zongo. Okay. I'll take it. - It's so big! - Get him! Zongo, calm down. What the fuck? Hey, Mr. Lobo. - Men's room? - Just down the hall. Miami. Open. There. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Easy. Easy, Zongo. Easy. Easy. That's good. - That's good. - Get him up. Hey, you look better. Yeah, I'm better now. I am gonna win this thing, face or no face. Got a birthday table and I've got 'em in the palm of my hand. - So you want to sing with me? - Yes, I do. Get your poop in a group. - Any second now. - Believe it when I see it. Sorry. Shit. Connor, hey. Mr. Lobo, I just need a minute of your time to talk about why you fired me. Connor, please. I don't know what you're taking about. It's okay, I understand. I mean, you cast me to play a big-nosed cop and I got a nose job. It was stupid. I didn't even know you had a nose job. Looks pretty good though. Turn your head that way. Yeah. Who's your doctor? I've got a 12-year old daughter with a fucking beak. She's got bean bag tits and a big caboose too. That poor girl's gonna have a hard road ahead. Mr. Lobo, I know I made a mistake. Look, kid, I didn't fire you for having a small nose. Mr. Lobo, I am not gonna turn you in to the nose police. You kill me, man. It was hard growing up with that nose. You are a real fucking moron, you know that? - What? - You read the script, didn't you, shithead? It's all nose jokes. ""I've been nosing around. I smell a rat."" And then you show up with that little cat nose. Doesn't make any sense. Do you realize how hard it is to rewrite an entire season? - No, sir. - You were a kid with a big nose. You got on TV but you fucked it up. You. Who? You fucked it up. Look, Mr. Lobo, I found out about this place that does nose enlargements. And if all goes well I could actually have the money to do it by tomorrow. The new honker is gonna be a goddamn fire hose. What are we supposed to do? Bring back Detective Shep Winford from the dead with a big nose? This isn't fucking ""X Files."" Goodbye. So you didn't donkey punch Morgan Fairchild. Jesus Christ. Hey, wasn't I in last place an hour ago? Yes, you were. - Was Zongo here? - Zongo was here all right. Sold entrees to a party of 6. I don't remember any of that. Not even the Champ offering grand? - grand for what? - Top seller. Fucking dodo bird. Nuts? Are you okay? I am Zongo. I am still going to win this contest because I can hold it together under pressure. Welcome to the Slammin' Salmon. Be graceful and amazing 'cause that's what I am. Donnie? Who the fuck is Donnie? I'm Donnie, Mr. Salmon. Good try, Dave. No, I'm Dave's twin brother. And you know what? Another thing, I don't care how severe her peanut allergy is. Did anybody ever tell you you guys look exactly alike? Every day. Is that why you wear the blue lipstick? Either way, I hope you like hospital food. No, I was recently a busboy. - I wasn't a part of this thing. - Yeah, you know what? Excuses are like assholes. Everybody's got one, but don't nobody want to admit it. Now get your ass out of last place or I'm gonna use your spine for a jump rope. What the fuck? I'd still hit that. - I got it. - Nice. Dude, where's the South African Bing diamond? Shit! Ladies, hello and welcome to the Slammin' Salmon tonight. Let me tell you about some of the more delicious things on our menu. We have a boneless fillet of... champion-- also a very nice black eye-- sock-eyed salmon. It's very nice. It's sautéed... heartbeat... He's watching me. Little story for you, Dave II, before you get back to work. When I was training for the Dispute in Beirut, I used to run miles a day with a baby camel strapped to my back. So you can understand how bemusing I find it that you're trying to run away from me. I was... Don't run. Just take it. Okay, here we go. Here we go. Here's to ""CFI Hotlanta"" and its record Emmy Award nominations. - Yay. - Hear hear. Connor. Come here. Come here a second. Come here. Hey, buddy, we couldn't have done it without you, man. - Hear hear. - Hear hear. Thanks a million. Connor, have you met our newest cast member? This is Steve Lemmaduche. Hey, buddy. What's crackin'? Call me Duche. Hey, what are those guys eating over there? Over there? That's the salmon. Yeah. That smells beautiful. Hustle me out one of those. And a chocotini, dry. Thanks, pal. The Duche. Connor. Look, I just know you're gonna find another show really soon. Thank you, Morgan. And that being said, I also know that I ordered my ahi tuna seared, and, baby, this is not seared. I'll get that right back to you. Thank you. Donnie? What are you doing? Are you crying? No. What is that? It's not coming off. The Champ is gonna kill me. There's no way I can get out of last place. Donnie, he's not gonna kill you. Didn't you hear? Last place is a broken rib sandwich. You see? Breaking your ribs won't kill you. Okay, Look, Donnie, why don't you take one of my tables? The McNaultys. They're great tippers and they've got a huge check. My gift to you. Shut up. You need that money for school. Nutella's check is over 1,000. Once I close her out, I'm gonna shoot past everyone. Take the table. - Really? - Yeah. - How would I pay you back? - I don't know. Take me out for a broken rib sandwich sometime. Help me up. Come on, you lush. Welcome to the Slammin' Salmon. My name is Zongo. How is everyone feline this evening? The '62 salmon is ""purrfect."" Would anybody like to try? Yes. Everybody take a sip. Delicious. How about you, ma'am? How does that taste? How does that taste? How does that taste? How does that taste? How does that taste? How does that taste? How does it taste? How does it taste? How does that taste? How does it taste? Definitely the hardest substance known to man. So good. My God. - I love it. - I'm glad you like it. Yes. Yes, I'll marry you. - I love you so much. - I love you too, baby. - Tara, Tara, Tara. - What? Can you go check on Nuts, please? Why do I have to do it? Rich, I'm slammed. 'Cause you're a doctor, come on. I'm not even close to being a doctor. I'm a second-year med student. I'm making half of this shit up. Come on, isn't it part of your Hippocrastic Oath? Hippo what? Look, don't put this on me, okay? He got punched out by that gigantic mongoloid because you denied him his medication. You sold him out just like you sold out Mia and that poor kid Donnie. And all because you're afraid of Cleon. God, you're a real spineless pussy, Rich. Hey, of them. Jesus. Look at these babies. - Honey, hi. - Hey. What are you doing here? Well, the kids couldn't sleep so I thought we'd pop in and say hi. Mrs. Rich Parente in the house. - Hey, Champ. - Hey. Cleon. I don't mean to be mean, but, baby, you need some Listerine. That's my little sister. Always tells it like it is. Look at the little babies. Hey, it's Uncle Cleon. Damn, they all look the same. What'd you do, fuck a Xerox machine? Watch your goddamn mouth in front of my kids. - It's Uncle Cleon. Watch it. - No, no, not too close. - Okay, easy now. Okay. - Keep your guard up. How the hell did you wind up with the Champ's sister? Well, believe it or not, the Champ introduced us and we fell in love and had these babies. And here we are. When I first was made aware of Richardo here, he cracked his head open running out of my office. And I thought right away, this guy is such a pussy. I knew he was such a pussy that he would never ever cheat on my sister. No, I'm serious. You want to know what my nick name for him was? Cunty McTwat. 'Cause he was such a pussy. Why isn't anybody laughing? - That's amazing. - Hey, babies, yes. The middle one has your head. Don't touch-- No, no, no. Okay. Okay, we've got some movement, you guys. This is bullshit! You gave Donnie all of Nuts's huge tables. Guy, it's anyone's game still, all right? There's only bucks separating first and last. - It's anyone's game. - That's awesome. You better not be lying, 'cause I will cut you. All right, one hour left. Go get 'em, guys, all right? - Okay okay. - Mia Mia Mia. I just sat the last table. You got 'em. It's the Miami Dolphin's offensive line and they're starving. Good luck. Sorry, but, you know... This is so not over. - You're gonna burn, baby. - I'm not losing this thing. I'm not losing this thing. All right, if you ladies are like me, you can eat a shitload of lobster. I am not leaving until you people are heaving. So that's orders of the Alaskan king crab legs. Eat it, fuck nut. Hey, how are you? I couldn't help but overhear you ordered the king crab. Well, we came in here dead set on the San Francisco cioppino, but that young lad made those king crab legs sound irresistible. It's just that you look like good people. And the chef asked us not to sell the king crab because... it's a week old. Why would that waiter recommend something that's turned? It's one of the most expensive items on the menu. You can figure it out. But please, you didn't hear it from me. My name is Guy. I like him more. That's the man I trust. Hi, guys. Welcome to the Slammin' Salmon. My name is Mia and I'll be your waitress. I apologize for my appearance, but I was in an explosion. Is this like Make a Wish Foundation? Yes, definitely. That's great. What a brave lady. I mean, showing your face in public like this. - Thank you. - Tell you what, Mia, we're starving, so would you start us off with some appetizers? Of course. We'll take t-bone steaks. each. - each. - Okay. Put some calamari on there. Good luck on your nose job. Thank you, Mr. Lobo. Give me a call when the bandages come off. - Okay. - We're doing ""CFI Greektown."" You might be right for Detective Stavros Popadropolis. - Okay. - Feel like I'm gonna give birth. Thank you, Mr. Lobo. Thank you, Connor. It's so good to see you again. Great to see you too, Morgan. You look terrific. - Thank you. - Hey, man, you're a hell of a waiter. Don't quit your day job. Boop. Get lost. Enjoy not winning grand, sucker. Honey, that's so cute. But I still have Nutella and, whew, it is a huge check. Don't worry though. When I'm done with school I'll fix your nose for free. Any shape you want, okay? Button nose, cute little clown nose. A brown nose. That works well for you. And I came in here dead set on the San Francisco cioppino. I'm very sorry, sir. We will change your order right away. - And Guy will be your waiter. - What? Donnie, the table is Guy's now. No, no, no. No, it was-- - See? I can step up to the plate. - Finally. Some pitchers of beer, that bucket of jumbo shrimp, that spinach artichoke dip, and of course that 8-lb lobster you were talking about. - Yes. - And that should do it. Okay. Baby girl, what's wrong? It's just you guys are so nice. And this is my biggest check ever. I just really needed this. And you're the nicest waitress we've ever had. You know, Mia, I know you were pretty once. Thank you. That's disgusting. I'm gonna be sick. I just wanna win. And, word to your mother. All right, girl. Nutella, I'm sorry. This isn't the check that I gave you. Yeah it is. Champ comped us. I throw a little knee right there. It bends him down. Bam! Well, were you dissatisfied with the service? - You didn't leave a tip. - Do the math. 20 of nothing is nothing. Come on, y'all. We outie. Shit. Here you go. I didn't want to interrupt. Thank you. Have you read this? No. I can't say that I have. I did not know anything, anything at all till now. You remind me of a young Andrew Bolkonski. Thank you. No, thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry, sir. I think you made a mistake. I can't take that much money. I didn't make a mistake. What's your name? Donald Kanogi. I'm dying, Donald Kanogi. My doctor told me I have a month to live. Have you ever heard of schistophosiasis? No, I haven't. Well, I've got it. - I've got it hard. - My God. All I wanted to do tonight was to sit quietly, have a nice meal, read a little Russian pre-existentialism. It was pretty crowded, but unlike the other waiter, you were content to let me sit here nonetheless. And I thank you for that. But, sir... No, young man, you can't take it with you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a lot of living to do before I die. Do svidaniya. That poor man. You know, it really puts things into perspective. Fuck him and the horse that rode over him. That's Guy. Big heart, big hair. That's me. Throw big dick in there, you got a box trifecta. You know what? It's way too late for that kind of chatter. - Heyo, I've got the totals. - All right. - Who wants to see some results? - I do, I do. - Yeah. - Gather round. This is pretty exciting. - Gather around, everybody. - All right. - I'm excited. - Good. - Are you guys ready? - Yes. Okay. First, before I start, let me just say - I'm really proud of you guys. - Thank you. Very proud. I think you did a great job tonight. - Thank you. - Here we go. In 3rd place... - is the waiter... - Jesus Christ. - who did a good job tonight... - Say it, you big dog. - Come on. - and his name is Nuts. - Hey, Nuts. - In the pickle jar, all right. - Great. - Okay. - Bring it. - Here we go. In 2nd place, and runner up, is... - Come on. - Connor. What? Who won? Drum roll, please. Drum roll. Great, thank you. And the winner of the 10,000 prize and the big contest tonight is... Tara. - My God! - Honk the goose. - What? - My God, I won? How is that even possible? Well, the guy who got hit by the horse gave her a 1,000 tip. I had that table. That's my table. Jesus, Donnie. You gave me a table, I gave you a table. That is the most selfless thing anyone has ever done for me. Well, when the Champ kills me, just see to it I get a decent burial. You're not gonna die. I'll give you mouth to mouth. Stick a sock in it before I puke. Richardo. It's time. All right, if you guys will excuse me for one second... All right, baby, what is the final take? Am I sitting in the lap of luxury or what? Well, we made... 19,017. 19,017. Pretty good. But last time I checked, is lower than 20, right? That makes you a grand short, short shorts. What's that? - The waiter's tips. - Problem solved. I'll just take a grand out of that then. No, no, no, hold on. Excuse me, Champ. About the grand. - Not now, Tara. - The what? The 10,000. There is no 10,000. That was all predicated on an illusion. I don't understand. Okay, I'll break it down. If I needed to make tonight, why would I give away 10? That makes no sense. Right, Rich? Right. Thank you. Adieu. Champ. This money belongs to the waiters. And you owe Tara 10,000. What the hell is wrong with you, Richardo? You offered a prize and now you owe her. You want to make something of it? Yeah, I do. Just do what you promised, you motherfucker. What? Well well well, looks like somebody's little acorns done grew into big nuts. You're finally acting like a man. But you're too little too late. I still got to pay the Yakuza 20,000 yen. Wait, yen or dollars? Same thing, stupid. Yen is Japanese for dollars. Actually, Champ, 20,000 yen is about American dollars. Ah-so. In circumspeculation that makes sense. When I was in the Orient I used to wonder to myself why is everything so small yet so expensive? Good work, Dr. Doolittle. for me. grand for you. What do you think I should do with the rest of it? I think you should give it to the waiters. - I think they earned it. - Yeah, I guess so. I was wrong to think they could be replaced by robots. Nice one, Rich. Feed, my pretties, feed. My God! Money money money! God. Rich. - That was legendary. - Thank you. Well, I guess I should thank you properly for what you did. That's so nice. Subtitles: Arigon Just-- Okay. Okay okay, what the fuck, Donnie? You see that, Donnie? That's how you kiss a girl, you fucking fruit cake. I hate you. God. It tastes like tartar sauce. Wait wait wait wait. Hold on. I almost forgot. I still got to kick the shit out of the low man. Is he fucking serious? God. Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Have you gone crazy? Are you crazy, man? All right, come on. Let's get this over with. I've got to get home and watch ""Dancing with the Stars."" Nick Lachey is doing the jitterbug. He's good. Have you ever seen him? - No, no. - You've got your guards up. - You want to fight? - You're just kidding, right, Champ? Don't be so scared. You should learn to control your fears. Take me for instance. I'm afraid of the dark. But you'd never know it 'cause I have mental discipline. You know what I'm saying? I don't even use a nightlight no more. - Okay, okay. - What's up? What? What's up? What's up?  It's the cry of the cougar, the fist to the face  No pride or glory for the loser  There's blood and broken teeth all over the place  And the last thing you'll hear  Is the cry of the cougar  Lock your doors  Get off the streets, I'm on the prowl  I'm telling you I'm on the hunt now  Don't try to stop me  I smell raw meat and I ain't had shit to eat for days  Who wants a piece?

It's the cry of the cougar  The fist to the face  I'm gonna shoot you with my Luger  There's blood and broken teeth all over the place  And the last thing you'll hear  Is the cry of the cougar  I've got the speed  I've got the book  I'm lean and mean and swift and tough  And big and fast, yeah  It's like if a ninja man  Had sex with the Hulk  And gave birth to some kind of crazy ninja Hulk  It's the cry of the cougar  The fist to the face  I'll slash you up like Freddy Krueger  There's blood and broken teeth all over the place  When your mom finds your body she'll cry  The cry of the cougar  Cry, cougar, cry. What's up, noodle dicks? That to-do-you-- Hey, noodle dicks. God damn it. Come on. What's up, noodle dicks? That table over there just ordered rounds of premium tequila. Now you guys-- now you guys-- Shit! I missed each and every one of you. I don't like that shit. I don't like the dark. Y'all didn't fucking see ""Green Mile""? I am afraid of the dark. - That's fucked up. - Cut. My God, that's crazy. And I'm Barack Obama. And I'm Osama bin Laden. And I'm Obama bin Laden. And I'm Shaquille O'Neal. And I'm Gloria Estefan from the Miami Sound Machine. I can do it. I can do it. - Can you do a faster one, please? - Okay. Cut. Good, let's go from the top again. Is it gross? All right, cut. Cut cut cut. It wasn't gross. I just thought I'd put it back. Well, you know what they say: All the good ones are either gay or crazy. Or fat. Or gassy. Or Dutch. Or uncircumcised. What does that mean? Cut! And she throws an elbow across like this. So I want to grab her-- I started to do like that. Body shot, body shot, body shot, body shot. We were in the clinch like this and I started to go, ""Bitch, what the fuck are you doing?"" So I'm like... and I'm trying to hit him. And we cover up like this and I'm moving around. I'm like, ""This dude is--"" no, don't turn your back. Stay right here. Last week on ""Heroes."" Yeah, cut. Yes. Very good. 'Cause I'm bored. Cut. Cut.  Ay, mamacita  Go on and do your thing, yeah  Go on and do your thing, girl  Ay, mamacita  Go on and do your thing, yeah  Ay, mamacita  Go on and do your thing, yeah  Go on and do your thing, girl  Ay, mamacita  Go on and do your thing, yeah  Oh, yeah  Ay, mamacita."
71,2017,The Discovery,American,"The film opens with an interview with Thomas Harbor (Robert Redford), the man who scientifically proved the existence of an afterlife, which has led to an extremely high suicide rate. The interviewer (Mary Steenburgen) asks Harbor if he feels responsible, to which he says no. Directly after, a member of the crew kills himself on air.
On the two year anniversary of the discovery, Harbor's son Will (Jason Segel) travels on a ferry where he meets Isla (Rooney Mara). They have a conversation and Will notes Isla looks very familiar. He says he is upset that people keep killing themselves, while Isla thinks it's an easy way out. Will also shares a memory he had while being dead for a minute, where he saw a young boy at a beach.
Will is picked up by his brother Toby (Jesse Plemons), who drives him to an isolated mansion where their father has built up his new station. Will notes people working for him, and Toby says they all attempted suicide. They enter a room where Will meets Lacey (Riley Keough) and Cooper (Ron Canada), and sees his father tied up to a machine as they kill and revive him. Will blames him for the high suicide rate.
Later, Will sees Isla on the beach as she walks into the water with a backpack loaded down by a gym weight. He runs after, barely saving her. He brings her to the mansion, where she is taken in. At a later meeting with the occupants, Thomas reveals he invented a machine that can record what dead people see in the afterlife, which requires a dead person, and they steal the corpse of Pat Phillips (Paul Bellefeuille) from the morgue.
Will reveals to Isla that his mother killed herself when he was younger. The next day, they try to record the afterlife but nothing happens. After the failed attempt, Will enters the room alone and puts back a piece of wiring he took out of the machine, which then shows a sequence of Pat Phillips driving to a hospital, visiting someone and fighting with a woman there. Will finds the hospital from the recording online and visits it, but finds that the hallway from the video is gone after remodeling a decade prior.
Later, during a meeting, Thomas brings Lacey on stage and confronts her about telling other people in the mansion about the failed device and tells her to leave immediately. Will drives Isla to the hospital and shows her the recording and tells her that he thinks the device records memory rather than the afterlife. After breaking into the hospital, they find a file from Pat Phillips' father, who died in the hospital.
Isla finds out that the man in the recording has a different tattoo from the one she saw on Pat earlier. Will drives her to the beach, where she reveals to him that she had a son and that he died while she was asleep. Later they seek out the woman from the video, revealed to be Pat's sister Janice (M.J. Karmi). She tells them that Pat left her alone with their dying father and that he never visited him in the hospital.
Isla and Will grow closer together and share a kiss, which is interrupted by Toby. Together they rush to Thomas, who is hooked up on the machine and dead. They observe that he is seeing the night their mother killed herself, except that Thomas stops her. They are able to revive Thomas, who concludes that the afterlife is an alternate version of their existing life, only with different choices made. They agree to destroy the machine, as this revelation would provoke millions of suicides by people wanting to improve the lives they have. Thomas prepares to hold a speech, which is interrupted by Lacey shooting Isla, claiming she has just ""relocated"" her. Isla dies in Will's arms.
Later, a devastated Will hooks himself up with the machine. He arrives back on the ferry, where he meets Isla again, who states that this is a memory. It is revealed that Will is living in a memory loop trying to prevent Isla's death and that he restarts on the ferry every time. Isla says that he saved her and that they both will move on now. Although Toby and Thomas try to revive Will, he dies, promising Isla to remember her.
Will stands on the beach, where he sees a little boy and gets him out of the water. The little boy's mother, Isla, arrives and thanks Will. They don't recognize each other. After she leaves, he walks away, but starting to recall who Isla is, he slowly stops and looks back.",6.2,tt5155780,"Woman Dr. Harber, before we're live, I just wanted to say thank you for choosing me. Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. Woman The rich history you have with other journalists... Harber I chose you precisely because we don't have a history. Now, don't fuck it up. Woman 2 Fifteen seconds. People trust you... for decades have valued you. I think that's because people value the truth. Right, but don't you think your discovery was just... too dangerous to share with the world? Look, this has been my life's work for over years. There's nothing willy-nilly here. After much discussion, much debate, we all came to the same conclusion. - Which is? - Which is, once you explore all scientific possibilities, and you come to a consensus, how can you keep a discovery so vital to our existence a secret? And that discovery... You proved the existence of an afterlife. I prefer to call it a new plane of existence. I can't comment on terminology like ""soul"" and ""heaven"" and ""afterlife,"" but what I can say with scientific certainty is that once the body dies, some part of our consciousness leaves us and travels to a new plane. Your machine was able to capture brain wavelengths on a subatomic level, leaving the body after death. - Is that...? - That's correct. Where do those wavelengths go? My point is, a new plane of existence is out there. Yes, that is no longer in dispute. But you can't tell us what that is exactly. When you see a train leave the station... do you need to know where it's going to understand that you saw it leave? It's a tough pill to swallow. At one point, so was the Earth being round. But, Dr. Harber, why did it take you six months to address us? Where have you been? It seems to me that I invited you here, to my home. Yes, you did. Thank you. But... we only received that invitation after the suicide toll had rapidly reached a million. And during that time, celebrities, athletes, even a close colleague of yours, all ended their lives. Which is why I agreed to sit with you and try to calm the waters. Okay. I wanna ask you the question that everybody watching right now is probably wondering. Do you feel responsible for all those people killing themselves? No. - That's it? - That's it. Man Thank you, Dr. Harber... for my fresh start. Woman 1 Andy, no! Andy! - Andy! - Woman 2 Oh, no. Woman 1 Oh, God! - Why would you do that? - Woman 2 Somebody call 911. Woman 1 Help! Some.... Call help, please. Right now. Get someone here. My God! Why would you do that? Oh, God. Turn those cameras off. Man Welcome back to our coverage of the two-year anniversary of the Discovery. We'll be revisiting the touchstone moments of the past two years, with retrospectives all weekend long. Hard to believe that it's been a year and a half since Thomas Harber's first and only post-Discovery interview ended suddenly with an on-air suicide. Since then, the worldwide suicide toll has skyrocketed to staggering levels. Over four million people have taken their lives, attempting to ""get there."" As for Dr. Thomas Harber, he has not made a public appearance since that infamous post-Discovery interview. Completely off the grid-- woman I was listening to that. I was listening to that. I'm sorry, I thought-- I thought that I was alone. It's off-season. Why the fuck are you going to this dreary island? Well, you're going there. Moans Hi. Hi. Are you one of those lunatics who just sits next to a complete stranger in an empty movie theater? You look so familiar to me. It's possible we've met, but you don't have a memorable face. Okay. Chuckles I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. I didn't mean that. I just... The water. I'm just a little seasick. That's weird. It's your lucky day. I don't normally carry these around. Um... - Vertigo. - I'm not dizzy. You can't treat vertigo, just the effects. That's for nausea. Do I look like the kind of girl who's just gonna take a pill from some strange guy? Fair enough. Isla. My name's Isla. I don't look like an Isla, though. Your first three years, you look like whatever name you're given, then by four, you either settle into your name or you just... - What about you? - What? What's your name? Oh, uh, Will Stevenson. Mouths Will. What? I'm just trying to see if you look like your name. - What's the verdict there? - I don't know. It's too early to tell. You know, Will is just such a, like, ""Will"" name. Chuckles You're really something. Happy second Discovery anniversary, Will. They said on the news they're expecting like a whole slew of suicides today. People trying to get there for the anniversary. I heard something about that. Did you see that video of those dumb cheerleaders taking pills on the 50-yard line? I just can't get behind the concept of suicide groups. It's so... disingenuous, you know? It just feels so weak. - You don't believe in the Discovery? - No, I don't believe in suicide groups. The Discovery is-- I mean, the proof is overwhelming. Proof shouldn't be overwhelming. Proof should be definitive. So, you don't believe. I don't believe the way everybody else does. No, I don't. - And how's that? - I'm a neurologist. Three months ago, I had a patient, really young, found out that she had brain cancer. Very sad. She reacted to that diagnosis as though I'd handed her a fucking winning lottery ticket. It wasn't because she hoped that maybe she was going someplace better. It was because the Discovery made her think that it was guaranteed. Well, yeah. Death used to be something we just had to live with, and now it's a convenient way to escape pain. That's okay. That's okay? Another plane of existence, maybe. Who knows? But I look around, I see a lot of people jumping out of planes hoping they're gonna grow wings. Reality and fantasy are mutually exclusive. They don't exist in the same space. Car engine revving What? When I was five, I had an accident, and I died for about a minute. When I was resuscitated, I told my parents that I saw something. Flashes. A little boy. Me, maybe, or my brother. I felt stranded... Stranded where? This empty beach. It doesn't matter. It was a dream. It was a dream that I embellished after I woke up. Vehicle approaching Why would you make all that up? I think it's our instinct to search for meaning, and when there is none, it's our instinct to create meaning and we just... lie. We lie to ourselves. You are so annoying. Has anyone ever told you that? Yeah, they have. Ugh. Thank God we only have a minute left together before we're strangers again. You think it's gonna be a minute this time of year? You're crazy. Vehicle approaching Crazy, but right. That's the attractive-girl component and I didn't factor that in. Isla You'd better work on your math. Hey! For whatever it's worth, I think you do look like an Isla. How many of us have you met? Isla chuckles door closes horn honking country music playing over stereo - I got it. - No, I got it, man. Well, I don't want to die before we get there, Toby. - What's going on over here? - Eddie. - Wait, Eddie Iodice? Eddie died? - Mm-hmm. Yeah, just to get there. Just to fucking get there. Guy pulled a Marilyn Monroe, downed a whole bottle of pills right there in his bedroom. Chuckles Good dude, too. - Real pity. - You didn't wanna go to the service? Go to the...? I would rather stick my dick in a wood chipper - than go to another fucking funeral. - Got it. You know, I'm not as stupid as you might think. When you called the other day and I told you that Dad had built something new... after that conversation... suddenly you wanted to come home. - You're sounding just as paranoid as him. - Chuckles Toby Dad said he needed to change things up. People knowing our address was too dangerous. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you on the phone, but we don't trust phones now. Here we are. Off to see the wizard. Will What the fuck is this place? Uh, it used to be a summer camp for ""troubled youths."" Which I never really understood, because if they're bad kids, why would they deserve a fun summer? You know? But then it shut down and Dad bought it. What do you think? Will I think it's completely insane. Well, the truth is we just needed a lot more space to house things. House what things? Toby These people were all affected by the Discovery. Some of them arrived here after two or three failed suicide attempts. We gave them a home, something to live for in this life, a reason to contribute. Oh, uh, real quick. Just FYI, FBI-type thing, protocol is no cell phones. - Yeah, okay. Let's go. - Yeah. Hey, don't worry. Beeping equipment beeping man This is truly thrilling. I can only compare it to the model train set you let me assemble by myself on my birthday. Woman Cutting it a little close. Toby Oh, well, you know me. Pins and needles, needles and pins. These goddamn machines. - Who the hell's that? - His other son just returned. Surprisingly taller than I remember. Good to see you again, Cooper. Will, Lacey. Lacey... That went well. Where's Dad? - Is he dead? - No, of course not. He is now. - Lacey Fifteen seconds. - Dad? Alarm beeping Take it easy. They're just running some tests. - It's all routine. - Ten seconds. Paddles charged... and ready. Defibrillator shocks See, they're recharging the body to reboot the brain. The longest he's ever officially under is, like, seconds. Exhales - high-pitched tone - muffled chatter door opens and closes So, Dad is now killing himself and electroshocking back to life. No. Kind of. But you're... You're looking at this all wrong. You're wearing whatever the opposite of... What is it? Rose-colored glasses. That's what you're wearing. Shit-colored glasses. Anyway, you shouldn't worry, because all of this is being closely monitored and controlled. And we both know you've always been slightly skeptical of everything. Dad started a cult. - No. - Can you not see that? This is a cult. All the way down to these followers in different-colored jumpsuits. No, no, no. There's no hierarchy here, Will. Dad calls it... distinctions in clearance. - That's all. It's not a cult. - It should be different. Straitjackets. You're the one that wanted to come back here for whatever reason. Right? Now, that, right there, is the million-dollar question. Welcome back, Will. Clears throat - Will groans - Harber sighs You mind telling me something? What are you doing back here? I'm here because I want you to stop it. I'm asking you just to put an end to all this. How would I do that? Say that you were wrong. Take it all back. I can't take it back, Will, because it's the truth. Who knows better than you? You were the inspiration for this. Aren't you curious? Please, don't say that. That's not... - I wasn't. - Ah, but you were. Hang on. ""Therefore, it is my belief consciousness should be considered as another state of matter."" - Please don't. - Hang on. I'd like to get to this other part. It gets good. ""Properties of consciousness arise from the physical laws that govern our universe."" Sighs - I was wrong. - You don't believe that. We were wrong, Dad. We were wrong because a lot of people died. And a whole lot more people are gonna kill themselves... while you experiment here in this ridiculous fortress. So, just slamming on the brakes of years' work? I'd be saying I'm responsible. Maybe you are. So, you think I've gone too far? Well, I don't think I've gone far enough. We opened the door for these people, Will. They know it's there. Now we have to show them what's behind it. Door closes - high-pitched tone - muffled chatter Isla! Isla! Isla! Muffled shout Isla! Will yells Will Oh, fuck! - What are you doing? - What's your problem? Groans Come on. Stand up. Get up. - Will Why are you doing this? - Isla None of your fucking business. You sat there on that fucking ferry and had a conversation with me, knowing you were gonna do this. You were supposed to be the last person I ever spoke to. You don't get to just change that! Ah. You're not even emotional about dying. I'm not emotional about anything. Toby I'm just concerned... that this will all be perceived unfavorably by some. Will She was going to catch pneumonia, Toby. Toby I still don't know what you want me to do with her. Will You told me that you take in people who need help. She needs help. She still can't just stay here. We have rules. Then can we make an exception... in her case, please? We're talking about somebody's life. We have no idea if she will attempt or try to... Kill myself again? You can say it. I know what happened. I was there when you ruined it. She and I have been getting along great. We still have rules. She has to talk to Dad, and she has to take the questionnaire. What's the questionnaire? - Um... - Can we be...? Will, you have a visitor. Your dad is Thomas Harber? Harber So, nobody but the conductor, which is me, is gonna know your answers. Everything is completely discreet here. And now Lacey will be giving us some privacy. It used to be about global exploration, you know, discovering new land, and then it was space travel. Shining a light on the dark corners of the universe. And now it's exploring what comes after this life. Seeing what's next. How old are you? Man on recording You are all part of the same thing. Cells in a body. Waves in the ocean. The soul isn't young or old. Harber Do you accept the fact that time is a nonlinear illusion created by man? Pass. I don't know what that means. There are no right or wrong answers to this questionnaire. - Then why do you bother giving it? - That's a good response. Harber Okay, greatest ability... and most disappointing weakness. Isla I guess I'm good at seeing what makes somebody tick. Understanding who they really are. Harber Weakness? I'm able to understand them, but I'm not able to care about them. If somebody mentions ""subconscious"" to you, what do you think? - Memory. - Dig deeper. - Hidden memory. - Would you say that you suppress emotions? I don't really like talking about myself like this. You don't have to like it. We think about ourselves every day. Everything is from our own perspective. So, as much as you may not want to indulge yourself in looking at your most inner thoughts, they're there. Make no mistake. They are there. Harber Do you believe in a soul? If not, close your eyes. Great. Let's just say a soul does exist. Where in the body do you think it'd be? I think if there's a soul, it would belong in the brain. Machine beeps Harber Wow. Now, that's interesting. Most people say the stomach. But I like that you didn't. Harber Have you ever experienced sudden loss? Yes. And what aspect of regaining normalcy after losing someone... was the most difficult? Inanimate objects, maybe? Like... my coffee table. I've had it for years and I've probably looked at it a million times, but after he-- Familiar objects just became distorted and unfamiliar. I started to hate my ceiling fan, my cereal bowl, my tea kettle. Harber Okay, last question. Are you legitimately suicidal? If you knew what came after... this life... do you think it would affect your decision-making or maybe even make you change your mind? Maybe. Knowing could change things. How'd you know this is where you'd be staying? I found our old bed. Yeah, I see that. And you should thank me... by the way, because grunts I fought long and hard to keep old faithful here. How's Isla? Oh... That's actually why I'm here. Will, she's dead. No, she's not. She's not dead. That was a bad joke. Um... But the questionnaire is all wrapped up. She can stay. Yeah, good. She needs to be looked after. She could try again. I don't think that's going to happen, Will. Sighs Because tonight... everything changes. We finally unveil it. What is ""it,"" Toby? Dad wanted me to invite you to a little gathering tonight, just a select group. Boy, this is nothing like our old house, huh? It sounds to me a lot like you're advocating murder. I'm not advocating murder. I'm just pointing out that most people don't look at ending somebody else's life the way they do their own. Sighing Where is he? It's about to happen. I can't tell when you're talking to me or that. It's really annoying. Anyways, what I'm saying is, people are killing themselves to get there. At a certain point, they'll use the same logic to kill somebody else, 'cause they're just sending them somewhere else, right? Finally, he's here. And he is not wearing the temp jumpsuit I had left for him. We're programmed to process our experiences as having a beginning and an end, when, in reality... doesn't exist. It's just one long, drawn-out middle. Some of you are newer than others, but I wanted to create a select group that could see what it is that I built. But before we do that, I'd like to take a moment and have you join me in... bowing our heads... And let your subconscious... take you somewhere else. I'm sort of amazed that you get swept up in this, this easily. You don't strike me as a say-your-prayers type. Just because somebody doesn't believe in God doesn't mean they can't pray. What kind of an atheist talks to God? Opera music playing over speakers Why did you give me a phony, bullshit last name? It wasn't phony. It was my mother's maiden name. Where is she? She's dead. How did she die? Because of my dad. Let us come back into this moment. I now offer you the opportunity... to see the afterlife. I can now record where we go. Cooper Please, uh... get these back to us at your earliest convenience. And again, these living quarters are just temporary until we can find you a more suitable room. When I first moved here, I slept on a cot in the kitchen. - Glamorous. - Chuckles I'm supposed to be at the bottom of the ocean, so this should be fine. Can I have a pen? Nondisclosure agreement. Well, considering the sensitivity, it's a fairly standard document. Could we have the room for a second, please? Cooper You remember that awful week when we slept on the cot by the fridge? My back sure hasn't forgotten. - Will Hey. - Mm. So... I know that that device is very compelling. Um... - Can we talk about it for a second? - I'm not allowed to talk about it, 'cause I just signed a nondisclosure agreement. Snickers sighs So, your dad's a little weird. Who cares? It doesn't make him wrong. I mean, Poe fucked his cousin. It didn't make him any less a writer. I wanna see if that machine does what he thinks it does. Well, what if it did? How would that change things? You don't go on vacation without looking at the brochure first. Hey. Uh... I'm sorry. Were you sleeping? I'm standing. Well, yeah. That's just something you're supposed to say, I guess. Um... Since you're up, mind coming downstairs and taking a look at something for me? Yeah, sure. Sighs woman on recording Those that we have lost are not lost at all... - Isla Where are you guys going? - It's nothing. Don't worry about it. ...then it's us who are lost. When he flatlines, think of it as a light bulb turned off by a switch. Flip it on, flip it off. But going under, hooked up to the new device, you're not just flipping a light switch. You're essentially detaching the entire bulb. So, I'd say that if you go under again... you're coming back with next to no brain functionality. I'm sort of surprised it hasn't happened already. I know you wanted to be first, but if you don't come back, what's the point? We just go back to the drawing board. Right? I mean, it could still work, we just need to find a new way to... We need a cadaver. Okay. Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt. Where do you guys plan on getting a corpse? I have a corpse idea. Rock music playing over earbuds - Am I being rude? - Huh? - Am I being rude? - No. - Care to... listen? - Sure. Crunchy groovy grooves. Serene nights. - Can I ask you something? - Mm-hmm. Will mentioned what happened to your mom earlier. That she killed herself? Not exactly. So, she was trying to get there? No, that was a good couple years before the Discovery. Huh. Bell rings Yeah. Door buzzes How you doing? In the midst of life, I am in death. That was weird. I was just wondering if you could help me out. My, uh, cousin, Billy... he's gone missing. And it being the two-year anniversary of the Discovery, we're all just a little worried. Really worried. We got three John Does in this week. How long has he been missing? Nope. No. No Billy here. Bummer. Would have made my life a hell of a lot easier. Sorry, that was insensitive. They just got me running rampant here. I'm doing the job of five people. Off-season cutbacks and whatnot? Yeah. Can I give you a description... of Billy? That way if he does... come in, you can keep an eye out for him. Of course. Let's go to my office. Toby Hey, so, just curious... chuckles I'd like to point out you're reading off a laundry list of corpse requirements. Aneurysm, that won't work. It'd be nice if you could help me, seeing as we're breaking and entering. Like a real, like, pouty-type face. And then, um... he's got a birthmark on, uh... Let's see. On his right elbow. You're not writing any of this down. Well, I think I've got more than I need to go on here, so... But we... We haven't even gotten to the lower half of his body. Don't you think it's weird how these people were alive a few hours ago? They had fears and desires, they could exercise? I don't think it's weird. I think it's fucking sad. - Maybe they went someplace better. - Maybe they went someplace worse. Maybe they went someplace that we can't even begin to comprehend. All the more reason to see what your dad's machine shows us. Shit. What? ""Fifty-two, massive coronary."" Will... meet Pat Phillips. Pat Phillips, this is Will. I don't like that creepy room Cooper put me in. I'm gonna sleep in your room tonight. Top or bottom? We could talk, you know. When I'm nervous, I talk too much or not at all. Well, you're safe here. I mean... nothing leaves the bunk beds. When I first got here and they gave me that jumpsuit, it had a V etched on it. I wonder what that stood for. ""Visitor,"" maybe? Is that a guess? That was a pretty good guess. It's like one of those really obvious answers that only seems obvious after you find out about it. Were you really smart growing up? I bet you were. I was told that I demonstrated an early ability to recognize spatial patterns, whatever that means. I always took it as one of those things a teacher tells to a parent to make them feel better about their shitty kid. Like, ""Gordon is very good at drawing circles. Gordon draws circles at a more advanced level than the other children."" These bunk beds really worked out well, 'cause they spared me the awkwardness of having to tell you I'm not gonna fuck you. Sorry, all I heard was something about circles and not fucking me. I don't wanna be the only fucked up person on this bunk bed, Will. Maybe... tell me about your mom now. There's not much to tell. She killed herself. On their anniversary. How did she do it? She made them dinner, and... my dad didn't even come out of his office. If he'd even just hinted that he gave a shit, I mean, who knows? But he couldn't be bothered. So, she went upstairs... took a bath instead and, uh... Yeah, the next morning I found her in the tub. And so, you left? Yeah, I had to. I couldn't be around it. I knew. It's like everything that was recognizable sort of instantly became unrecognizable. Sometimes I feel like I'm taking someone else's spot and then I feel sad. How do you mean? Like, being here alive is a waste because... I don't enjoy it, I'm not happy or grateful... and I'm taking a spot away from someone who maybe would've gotten something more out of it. Yeah. I guess I don't think it works that way. Here's something I haven't heard anyone talk about. Do animals have an afterlife? Bunnies, kittens, pigs, monkeys. What happens to them after they die? I mean, I feel like they really deserve an afterlife. Do they have their own animal afterlife? And if they do, is it subdivided by species? Because it feels like something as profound as an afterlife shouldn't practice segregation. Will chuckles And what happens to a child? Hold hands till we fall asleep? This doesn't seem entirely fair. Shh. Yeah, okay. Speaking indistinctly Lacey? Okay, Toby? Machine beeps, then whirs Did you hit...? Hit it again. Beeps, then whirs Again. Beeping and whirring continue Hit it again. I'm hitting it. Hit it again. - You're gonna fry the body. - Toby, hit it again. Again. Hit it again. Again. Hit it again. Door closes Is this just a setback or...? I'm really not sure. Keypad beeping door opens door closes Are you gonna see him? Or are you just gonna continue to ignore it? Pat I'm sorry... I can't. Woman Of course you can't. Story of your fucking life. Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess. - Hey. - Hey. What are you doing with my body? Your body, uh, is to be cremated at noon, so, I'm getting it ready. We do still have a little time to prep a redo. Redo? Guys, come on. You almost fried the body. You do this redo, you're gonna cremate him early. All right? Toby, rustle up a van. Will's right. It's good. Seeing you back in the labs again, it's good. It's where you belong. - Sighs - door closes inaudible dialogue Toby, I want you to locate me a new corpse, immediately. Hey. Can I ask you something? - Okay. - How'd you end up here? Why? I came home and found my dad and my sister hanging in my living room. To get there. I'm sorry. It's okay. They didn't want me to come. Can you imagine feeling abandoned 'cause your dad left you out of the family suicide? What's wrong with you? Oh. Nothing, I'm just... I'm processing. Groans I mean, do you ever get out of your head even for one minute? Let's do an experiment. Look at me and tell me the first thing that comes to your mind. I'm driving. Okay. I don't know you very well. I think you're beautiful, and alive, and if you killed yourself, it wouldn't just be sad, it would be a tragedy. Shut up. - You want the head or the feet? - Head. Okay. ""Oh, hey, Isla. What are you up to?"" ""Oh, nothing much, Jim. I'm just... lugging a corpse through a parking lot."" - Why'd you go with ""Jim""? - Don't be jealous of hypothetical Jim. Believe me, if hypothetical Jim makes you not wanna kill yourself, I can be supportive. Do we just leave it here? Believe it or not, it's my first time returning a corpse, so... I'm improvising. Hi, yeah, um, I was just driving by and this is kind of weird, but there seems to be, like, a dead body laying in your parking lot. - That was pretty good. - Shut up. Get out. - I'm saying you're doing a good job. Fine. - Stop it. Sorry. Yeah, no, bad... Bad reception on the island. Um... Yeah, the body seems to be abandoned, and... I don't know. Unless, of course, you guys are playing some sort of fucked-up scavenger hunt. Okay. Yes, thank you. Bye. - How'd that go? - It went really well. Okay. You're, like, weirdly good at that. - Oh. - Here they are. - Isla chuckles - They're pretty confused. What do you think they're thinking? I don't know, but I think Pat Phillips has had a really tough few days. We're both going to hell. Yeah. Whatever the afterlife is, I guess. I don't know. Just stupid. Sighs engine starts Are you gonna see him? Or are you just gonna continue to ignore it? Pat I'm sorry... I can't. Woman Of course you can't. Story of your fucking life. Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess. Woman on recording What if this life is just a dream? Can I borrow your truck? Just for... I have to go get some stuff. Woman As far as our records indicate, we've had patients with the name Phillips on file. - How accurate are your records? - Accurate. I would love to see that list. Mm. I'm sure you would. What the fuck? Are you looking for something? Maybe you can help me. Um... - Did there used to be a hallway here? - Used to. They did a little remodeling. Took their sweet-ass time with it, too. I'm sorry, how long ago was that remodel? About a decade ago. Electric guitar playing gently Isla Hey. - Hey. - Where have you been? This is, uh... This is interesting. Okay, thank you, Toby. Thank you, my boy. Well, hello to you all. As always, it's a pleasure. When you all first got here, you... You used this, uh, piece of equipment. The questionnaire. And your answers are what allowed you to stay here, so, basically... a trust was built. But lately, I'm beginning to wonder if perhaps we're getting just a little too comfortable here. There's a lot of loose talk going on. And it makes me think that we just might be losing a little focus. Lacey, would you join me, please? - What's going on? - It's okay. Relax. Would you like to tell us how long you've been here? Um... just over a year. Just over a year. You were one of the first. How have you been treated? Have you been treated well? - Have I been good to you? - You've been wonderful. - Why are you talking to me like this? - I've been wonderful. If I've been wonderful, then why are you telling your peers about the device, and particularly... why are you saying it failed? Speak up. Um... It's okay. I just told one person. It slipped out when I had mentioned how the new girl was invited. Harber You mean Isla. You were displeased when I invited her here, weren't you? It's just that some people who have been here much longer weren't asked. Tell everyone where I found you. Thomas. It's okay. This is a safe place. In the woods. Go on. I had a gun. And where was that gun aimed? At my chest. Right next to your heart. Usually, it's the head... or the barrel goes into the mouth. I don't know that I've ever seen it done that way before. I'm sorry. Please don't lose faith in me. ""Faith."" Oh, God. I have such contempt for that word. Show me someone who relies on faith and I'll show you someone who's given up control over whatever it is they believe. Sorry, there's nothing more I can do for you. Thomas, please. Pack up your belongings. Say your goodbyes. That was a hell of a show out there. Come on, Will. You think I don't know a lot of this is bullshit? You give meaning to people who think they have no more reason to live. The jumpsuit, the chain of command, the theatrics. It gives them purpose. And I care about them. Yeah. Someone should tell that to Lacey. You... You can pretend all you want that the reason you left was because you stopped approving of my work. Work, by the way, that we did together. But I think we both know this was never about the Discovery for you. - It was always about your mother. - Yes, of course it was about Mom for me. Just because you wanna pretend like Mom did not happen... doesn't mean that I'm going to. Door closes indistinct chatter - Hey. Can I show you something? - What? - Just come with me. Please. - Sorry. Isla Wait. - What is this? - That's what I'm trying to figure out. - You were gonna keep this from me? - No, I'm... I'm showing you now. And I was afraid of what you might do. All right, so, the afterlife... This is the afterlife? How can it be the afterlife if we're in the same parking lot in that recording? Then what is it? My theory is that my father invented something that records memory. You've heard him go on and on about the subconscious. I understand that you wanted this to be something different. The proof is overwhelming that that's a Pat Phillips memory. Proof shouldn't be overwhelming. It should be definitive. Beeps Where the fuck are we going? Will If what we're seeing on that video happened in real life, I'm gonna find out exactly when. Since this hospital opened, there have been patients named Phillips. But based on the model of his truck, I can eliminate any Phillips from before the year 2000. Yeah, but even after 2000, doesn't that leave a lot of names? That hospital room doesn't exist anymore, so, we can also cross off any Phillips from the past decade. That leaves us with one. ""Connor Phillips""? That's him. That's Pat Phillips' dad. He died here years ago. So, it does just record a memory? Will It's pretty fucked up what happened today, huh? With Lacey? She spoke out of turn. And she knew the rules. She basically helped write them. It's just you and me talking. You don't believe that. Stop telling me what I believe, Will. Proving the existence of an afterlife destroyed Dad's own life. That's what I believe. Yeah... everybody else's, too. Dad has no intention... of showing anything the machine records with the outside world. That's why he lost it when Lacey told people. If he has no intention of showing what it does to anybody, why is he doing it, huh? What's the point? ""Why is he doing it?"" Chuckles ""Why is he doing it?"" Let's see. Well... he'll tell you about the millions of people who died, and he'll tell you about finishing his work to honor them. I heard that yesterday. I've been hearing that for the past two years now. Toby chuckles And I just... smile and nod and agree... like the idiot son, but I do understand things. I know Mom died... Not died. She killed herself. She killed herself. And when you look... at what Dad spent his life working on, and when you look at the way Mom killed herself, how she did it... how would Dad not feel a little anger on top of his guilt? Hmm? Dad does need... to know. He needs to know that she made it somewhere. He overreacted, that's all. He'll come to his senses, and, uh, Lacey will be back by tomorrow. Dad always comes to his senses. It's not a memory, Will. What? Isla On his left arm in that exact spot, there was a different tattoo. - Will How is that possible? - I don't know, but in the lab, I saw it. It wasn't a lighthouse. It was waves on his arm. - Are you sure? - Yes. It's not a memory. This is something else. If it's not a memory, then what is it? Everything we've seen doesn't exist anymore. I mean, the hospital room's gone, Pat Phillips, obviously gone. We need to find something in this video that still exists. The... The woman. There's a... Her. We have Connor Phillips' address on his death certificate. So, I say that we go down there tomorrow... and we see if somebody can help us track her down. Will, why are we back here? I don't know what's waiting for us at that house, and I... Do you remember I told you about my accident when I was a kid? Yeah, when you lied to your mom about what you saw. I didn't lie. I didn't lie. Sighs This is where I saw whatever... Whatever it is that I saw. This is the beach. I used to come here when I was a kid, like... I was drawn to it. Or it made me feel better. Anyway... Um... when I saw you walking into the water the other day, that's... That's why I was here. What? I had a son... and he was five years old. And I fell asleep... just for a second. And when I woke up, he was gone. At first I thought I wasn't supposed to meet you... or feel anything. But maybe I was wrong. Will sighs Um, hi. Is this the Phillips residence? Connor... Did you know Connor Phillips? Pat Phillips? Can you speak English? Okay. Okay, well, that's clearly not the woman from the video. Maybe they moved or something. Should we see if they have the new address? I don't know. I don't know. Can I help you? I haven't seen my brother in years. I'd call it more of a loss for her than for me. Alzheimer's. She deteriorated after Dad died. - Connor? - You knew my father, too? You know, actually, Pat mentioned him. That he went to see him before he died. Well, anyway, Dad died and... Mom, she started going downhill real fast after that. My husband and I, we own the house now. Is there gonna be a service or anything, um, for Pat? I wouldn't know. I'm sorry, if you don't mind me saying, you don't seem that upset about your brother's death. Sighing Look... it seems as though you liked him. You found something in him... so, I'm sorry. But to the rest of us... he was a piece of shit who left his sister with a cancer-ridden father and a mother who lost every marble she ever had. I'm sorry. So... clears throat is the last time that you saw Pat when he went to visit your Dad in the hospital? I don't know what bullshit he hauled your way, but he never visited my father in the hospital. If he told you that, it's a lie. He called and said he was gonna visit him, but he never showed up. This is gonna sound really strange, but did Pat have a tattoo? He told you about that? Well... When he turned 18, we got matching waves. We were really close then. So, the machine doesn't record a memory. It wasn't a bad theory. People are just gonna keep killing themselves. You know, sooner or later, you're gonna have to forgive your dad. I've been thinking a lot about the difference between... what something is and what something means. And I don't know what any of this is... but I do think if there's a meaning to any of it, it has something to do with not pressing the reset button, even if things get really rough. We're a bunch of people running around, making the same mistakes over and over. And I don't know why we think it'll be different somewhere else... unless we learn what we're supposed to while we're here. Isla sighs What was your son's name? Oliver. I was dreaming. When he was in the water, I was dreaming. What about? I don't know. I can't remember. It was one of those times where you know for sure you're dreaming, but you don't... don't know what about. I wish I knew. You don't have to do this alone anymore if you don't want to. Toby Will! Fuck! Fuck, Will! Get up. It's Dad. What the fuck are you doing? What about Dad? - It's dad. Get the fuck up. - Okay. All right. I'm coming. I didn't know, so, I couldn't stop it. Slow down and tell me exactly what happened. He hooked himself up to the device. He wanted to prove that it works. - Dad's hooked up right now? - Yes. Isla We need to tell him that it works. What? What works? - What are you doing? - He demanded. - Why aren't you bringing him back? - He's too far along. We already know that it records something. Cooper... it works, okay? Dad? Dad? Woman Time to pull yourself away. Come back to reality. Come home. - Is that Mom? - It's Mom. Harber What I'm doing is reality. I need to finish. It's important. Do you understand? - Their anniversary. - Yeah. Woman I'm going upstairs. Harber Now, don't be dramatic. I'll be done soon. And we can have dinner. Harber Honey, wait. Maybe work can wait. So, what do you say we have some dinner? She's not taking the bath. - That's not what happened. - I know. We can bring him back. Cooper, just... wait. We have to see what happens. Cooper We've got to do it now, or it'll be too late. Will, come on. Toby, I'm sorry. Cooper, now! - Dad? Dad, listen to me. - Defibrillator shocks Dad, please. Listen to my voice. - Is he gonna be brain...? - I don't know. I don't know. Cooper, hit it again! Defibrillator shocks Dad? Machine beeping What happened? I knew I saw her. Like a dream that you can't remember. I can't figure out what this is, Dad. I never left my study. Never stopped her on the stairs. - And she drew a bath. - Will I know. And in the Pat Phillips recording, he has a different tattoo on his arm. Harber I always said the afterlife was a different plane of existence. But... what if it's a different plane... of this existence? Alternate realities? No, our reality... with differences and variations. Stepping out of a truck... to visit a dying parent. Random, like different tattoos. Stopping someone from going upstairs to end their life. When we die, what if we travel to an alternate version of our own life? A second chance? Then we wouldn't... just have to accept our biggest regret. In the afterlife, we could change it. At the risk of stating the super fucking obvious... if you are right and word of this got out-- We have to destroy the machine. Cooper Hey, Thomas. Everyone wants to know what's going on. Welcome, everybody. Nice to have you all here. I asked you to gather here today because I thought that we should be honest. - Hi. - Honest with ourselves, honest with each other. - You got to see your mom again. - Harber I see you as family... and I think you see me in the same way. And as family... I think sometimes we get so absorbed with... what we're doing individually, we go off on our own track and so forth, we lose the fact that how important family is. - Gunshot - all gasp Lacey? Lacey. Lacey, it's okay. Put the... Put the gun down. Lacey, I was wrong. You do not need to do this. I didn't kill her. I just relocated her. Will Isla? Isla? Isla. Oh, it's okay. Isla? Dad! Oh, God. Dad, please! I need your help! Woman Somebody go get help. Panting I just wanted my spot back. Okay. Okay. Will Isla. Dad, please help her. Don't talk. Just breathe. I don't wanna die anymore. Muffled You're okay. I just need you to stay with me. Boy Yeah. Ha! Will mutters Isla? Isla? Toby They were asking, the cops, who to contact for Isla. - Next-of-kin deal. - Harber I'll have Cooper look into it. Toby Okay. I don't wanna overwhelm him with questions right now, okay? Okay. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Yeah. - Maybe I should go in and check on him-- - No, no, no. Don't. He needs rest. He needs to process, okay? - All right. - You can check on him after dinner. And then we'll finish breaking down the machine tonight. Toby Okay. But... we haven't come close... to figuring this all out yet, or what it all means. Like, if it really is another version of our own life, then what happens when we die again? Harber Toby. - Toby. - What? Harber We've got to let it go for a while. We've just got to. Grunting Harber Completely dismantled. - All traces need to be gone. - Thomas, I hear you. Panting grunts Harber William? Let us in, don't do this. William. Machine beeping He's on the ferry headed here? - Not the same here. - What? I don't understand. How are we watching this right now if he's not dead? Man on TV ...since Thomas Harber's first and only post-Discovery interview ended with an on-air suicide. Since then, the worldwide suicide toll has sky-- Isla I was watching that. Isla? - Isla? - Isla It's off-season. - Why are you going to this dreary island? - Isla? - I have to stop your shooting, Isla. - Sit down. I need you to come with me right now. Sit down, Will. This is just your memory. I'm a part of you. Sit down. What are we doing back on this ferry? What the fuck is going on? You were never able to stop me from killing myself until this life. ""This life""? What do you...? What do you mean, ""this life""? You always start back on the ferry. Will Reality and fantasy are mutually exclusive. They don't exist in the same space. Well, it looks like we're here. You know what? I changed my mind. I don't know what I was thinking. Isla The first time, you never got off the ferry. Then the next day you read that a woman named Isla had drowned herself. You went on and lived your life, but the thought that you could've done something never left. It was always there. Brakes squeak Isla And then one day, just like everybody else... I died. And then you came back here. How long have I been stuck living in this loop? How many times have we met on this ferry? Your death brings you back here. You keep coming back over and over again and again. I don't remember any of it. I don't remember these other lives. Nobody can remember them directly. But sometimes certain memories do have a way of sticking out. Will You look so familiar to me. You look so familiar to me. It's your lucky day. I don't normally carry these around. - This is where I saw whatever... - Will This is the beach. Toby How'd you know this is where you were gonna be staying? Will We're a bunch of people running around making the same mistakes over and over. And I just don't know why we think it's gonna be different someplace else. What am I supposed to change? You already changed it. You kept coming back until you saved me. I didn't save you, you died. There's more than one way to save somebody, Will. Harber Cooper, ready on our end. We need to bring him back. How can I hear my dad? He's in a different place. Two separate parts in the same place. Toby Okay, Dad, defibrillator's charged. No, no, no. I'm not ready to go back yet. I need more time with you. Toby, please wait! Not yet! Cooper His vitals are concerning me. If we pull him now, we might lose him. Isla. Isla, please. I'm not ready to leave you. - What's happening to me? - You're about to die. Cooper His heart's stopped, Thomas. Organs are shutting down. They're trying to bring you back. That's okay. If I die, I'll just come back here to you. No, not this time. You don't have to come back anymore. You helped me get to where I needed to be and now you'll go someplace else. When I get there, will I be able to remember you? I hope so. Toby Dad, everything is shutting down. His brain's showing barely any activity. You're leaving now. This is it. Harber I'm not leaving this room until we revive my son. When I get there... I'm going to remember you. Harber We've gotta pull him out right now. One... two... three. Monitor flatlines boy chuckles Oh, hey. Look. You okay? - Yeah. - Hey, come here. Let me help you. Come here, come here. Oh! I got you. Whoa! Whoa! Boy laughing You okay? - Holy cow. - Give me that pail. - You went down pretty good, huh? - Yeah. Yep. You okay? I got you. Whoa! Grunts Where's your mom and dad? Oliver! Oliver! Hi. It's okay. He's all right. He just... - Okay. - I told you, you can't-- You can't just run off on me like that, okay? I've told you. He was... He was just... He's all right. He was struggling a little bit in the water. I wanted to make sure he got back to you. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Yeah. He's a good kid. - You're okay. - Thanks. Will chuckles Isla You can't do that. You scared me. Okay? Can you walk a little bit?

72,2014,Interstellar,American,"In the mid-21st century, crop blights and dust storms threaten humanity's survival. Joseph Cooper, a widowed engineer and former NASA pilot, runs a farm with his father-in-law Donald, son Tom, and daughter Murphy. Living in a post-truth society, Cooper is reprimanded for telling Murphy that the Apollo missions were not fake; he encourages her to carefully observe and record what she sees. They discover that dust patterns, which Murphy first attributes to a ghost, result from gravity variations, and translate into geographic coordinates. These lead them to a secret NASA facility headed by Cooper's former supervisor, Professor John Brand, who explains that 48 years earlier a wormhole appeared near Saturn, opening a path to a distant galaxy with twelve potentially habitable planets located near a black hole named Gargantua. Volunteers had previously traveled through the wormhole to evaluate the planets, with Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reporting back desirable results. Brand explains he has conceived two plans to ensure humanity’s survival - Plan A involves developing a gravitational propulsion theory, allowing a mass exodus from Earth, while Plan B is a conventional launch of the Endurance spacecraft with 5,000 frozen embryos to colonize a habitable planet. Cooper is recruited to pilot the Endurance. When Murphy refuses to see him off, he leaves her his wristwatch to compare their relative time when he returns.
The crew consists of Cooper, the robots TARS and CASE, and the scientists Dr. Amelia Brand, (Professor Brand's daughter), Romilly, and Doyle. After traversing the wormhole, Cooper, Doyle, and Brand use a lander to investigate Miller's planet, where time is severely dilated. After landing in knee-high water and finding only wreckage from Miller's expedition, a gigantic tidal wave kills Doyle and waterlogs the lander's engines. By the time the engines restart, 23 years have elapsed in terms of Earth time.
Having enough fuel for only one of the other two planets, Cooper rules they go to Mann's, as he is still broadcasting. En route, they receive messages from Earth. Murphy Cooper is now a scientist working on Plan A. On his deathbed, Professor Brand reveals to her that Plan B was his only real plan, knowing that Plan A required observations of gravitational singularities from within a black hole.
On Mann's planet, the Endurance crew revive Mann from cryostasis. He assures them colonization is possible, despite an extreme environment. On an excursion, Mann attempts to kill Cooper and reveals that he falsified the data in the hope of being rescued. He steals Cooper's lander and heads for the Endurance. While a booby trap set by Mann kills Romilly, Brand rescues Cooper with the other lander and they race to the Endurance. Mann is killed in a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging the Endurance. Through a difficult docking maneuver, Cooper regains control.
With insufficient fuel, they resort to a slingshot around Gargantua which costs them another 51 years. In the process, Cooper and TARS must jettison their landers to allow Brand and CASE to reach Edmunds' planet. Slipping past the event horizon of Gargantua, they eject from their craft and find themselves in a tesseract, possibly constructed by humans of the far future. Across time, Cooper can see through the bookcases of Murphy's old room on Earth and weakly interact with its gravity. Realizing that he is now Murphy's ""ghost"", he manipulates the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her before he left, transmitting via Morse code the quantum data that TARS collected from inside the event horizon.
The tesseract, its purpose completed, collapses and ejects Cooper and TARS. Cooper wakes on a huge station, orbiting Saturn. He reunites with Murphy, now an old woman nearing death. Using the quantum data, she was able to develop the gravitational propulsion theory, enabling humanity’s exodus and transformation into an advanced spacefaring civilization. She reminds Cooper that Amelia Brand is out there alone. Cooper and TARS take a spacecraft to rejoin Brand and CASE, who are setting up a human colony on Edmunds' habitable planet.",8.6,tt0816692,"Well, my dad was a farmer. Like everybody else back then. Of course, he didn't start that way. Computer says you're too tight. - Nah, I got this. - Crossing the Straights. - Shutting it down, Cooper. - No! - Shutting it all down. - No, I need power up! Dad? Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed. - I thought you were the ghost. - No. There are no such things as ghosts, babe. Grandpa says you can get ghosts. Maybe that's because Grandpa's a little too close to being one himself. Back to bed. Were you dreaming about the crash? Get your butt back in bed, Murph. Heh. The wheat had died. The blight came and we had to burn it. And we still had corn. We had acres of corn. But... mostly we had dust. I guess I can't describe it. It was just constant. Just that steady blow of dirt. We wore... little strips of sheet... sometimes over our nose and mouth... so that we wouldn't breathe so much of it. Well, when we set the table, we always set the plate upside-down. Glasses or cups, whatever it was upside-down. Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on! Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn, Herbicide Resistance 101. - Check? - Yes, sir. Not at the table, Murph. Dad, can you fix this? - What the heck did you do to my lander? - Wasn't me. Let me guess. It was your ghost? It knocked it off. It keeps knocking books off. - No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass. - Hey. - I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist. - Dad, tell her. Well, it's not very scientific, Murph. You said science was about admitting what we don't know. - She's got you there. - Hey. Start looking after our stuff. Coop. All right, Murph, you want to talk science? Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost. No, you got to go further. You got to record the facts, analyze, get to the how and the why... then present your conclusions. Deal? - Deal. - All right. - Have a good day at school. - Hold up. Parent-teacher conferences. Parent. Not grandparent. Slow down, turbo! - That's not a dust storm. - Nelson's torching his whole crop. Blight? They're saying it's the last harvest for okra. Ever. He should've planted corn like the rest of us. Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley. She's single. What's that supposed to mean? Repopulating the earth. Start pulling your weight, young man. Why don't you start minding your own business, old man? All right, Murph, give me second. Third. - Find a gear, dumb-ass. - Grind it! Shut it, Tom! - What'd you do, Murph? - She didn't do nothing. - Blew a tire is all. - Murphy's Law. Shut up! - Grab the spare, Tom. - That is the spare. Get the patch kit! - How am I supposed to patch it out here? - You got to figure it out. I'm not always gonna be here to help you. What's going on, Murph? Why did you and Mom name me after something that's bad? - We didn't. - Murphy's Law? Murphy's Law doesn't mean that something bad will happen. What it means is whatever can happen will happen. And that sounded just fine with us. Whoa! Get in. Get in, let's go. What about the flat tire? Yeah. It's an Indian Air Force drone. Solar cells could power an entire farm. Take the wheel, Tom. Go, go, go! Keep that aimed right at it. Faster, Tom. I'm losing it. Right at it. Stay on it. Here we go. Whoa. Nice one, Tom. Dad? I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop! - Dad! - Tom! You told me to keep driving. Well, I guess that answers the old ""If I asked you to drive off a cliff"" scenario. - We lost it. - No, we didn't. Want to give it a whirl? This way. Go. Let's lay her down right there at the edge of the reservoir. Nicely done. How long you think it's been up there? Delhi Mission Control went down, same as ours... - ...ten years ago. - Heh. So for ten years? - Why did it come down so low? - I don't know. Maybe the sun cooked its brain or it was looking for something. - What? - Give me a large flatblade. Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know. What are you gonna do with it? I'm gonna give it something socially responsible to do... like drive a combine. Can't we just let it go? It wasn't hurting anybody. This thing needs to learn how to adapt, Murph... like the rest of us. How's this work? You guys come with? I've got class. This one needs to wait. - What did you do? - They'll tell you about it in there. - Am I gonna be mad? - Not with me. - Just please try not to. - Hey. Relax. I got this. - Little late, Coop. - Yeah, we had a flat. And I guess you had to stop off at the Asian fighter plane store. No, actually, sir, that's a surveillance drone. With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian. Take a seat. So... we got Tom's scores back. He's going to make an excellent farmer. Yeah, he's got a knack for it. What about college? The university only takes a handful. They don't have the resources to... I still pay my taxes. Where's that money go? There's no more armies. Well, it doesn't go to the university. - Look, Coop, you have to be realistic. - You're ruling my son out for college now? - The kid's 15. - Tom's score simply isn't high enough. What's your waistline? About what, 32? - About a inseam? - I'm not sure I see what you're getting at. It takes two numbers to measure your ass but only one to measure my son's future? Come on. You're a well-educated man, Coop. - And a trained pilot. - And an engineer. Okay, well, right now we don't need more engineers. We didn't run out of television screens and planes. We ran out of food. The world needs farmers. Good farmers, like you. - And Tom. - Uneducated farmers. We're a caretaker generation, Coop. And things are getting better. - Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin... - Are we done here, sir? No. Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph. Murph is a great kid. She's really bright. But she's been having a little trouble lately. She brought this in to show the students. The section on the lunar landings. Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks. She always loved the pictures. It's an old federal textbook. We've replaced them with the corrected versions. Corrected? Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union. You don't believe we went to the moon? It was a brilliant piece of propaganda. The Soviets bankrupted themselves pouring resources... - into rockets and other useless machines. - ""Useless machines."" If we don't want a repeat of the excess and wastefulness of the 20th century, then... we need to teach our kids about this planet, not tales of leaving it. One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI. If we had any of those left, the doctors would've been able to find... the cyst in my wife's brain before she died instead of afterwards. Then she'd have been the one listening to this instead of me... which would have been a good thing, because she was always... the calmer one. I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper. But Murph got into a fistfight with several of her classmates over this... Apollo nonsense. So we thought it best to bring you in and see what ideas... you might have for dealing with her behavior on the home front. Yeah, you know what? There's a game tomorrow night. She's going through a bit of a baseball phase. Her favorite team is playing. There's gonna be candy and soda and... I think I'll take her to that. How'd it go? I got you suspended. - What? - Cooper. This is Cooper. Go. Coop, those combines you rebuilt went haywire. Just reset the controllers. I did that. Now you should come take a look. One by one they've been peeling off the fields and heading over. Something's interfering with the compass. Magnetism or some such. Nothing special about which book. I've been working on it, like you said. - I counted the spaces. - Why? In case the ghost is trying to communicate. I'm trying Morse. Morse? Yeah. - Dots and dashes, used... - I know what Morse code is, Murph. I just don't think your bookshelf's trying to talk to you. Had to reset every compass clock and GPS to offset for the anomaly. - Which is? - I don't know. If the house was built on magnetic ore... we'd have seen this the first time we switched on the tractor. I hear your meeting at the school didn't go so well. Heh. You heard? It's like we've forgotten who we are, Donald. Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers. When I was a kid... it felt like they made something new every day. Some... gadget or idea. Like every day was Christmas. But six billion people... just try to imagine that. And every last one of them trying to have it all. This world isn't so bad. And Tom will do just fine. You're the one who doesn't belong. Born years too late, or years too early. My daughter knew it, God bless her. And your kids know it. Especially Murph. Well, we used to look up in the sky and wonder... at our place in the stars. Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt. Cooper, you were good at something... and you never got a chance to do anything with it. I'm sorry. You didn't expect this dirt that was giving you this food... to turn on you like that and destroy you. In April... I believe I'm right... Fifteenth of April, I think. This happened about 1:30 when that thing... came off the top of that canyon. In my day, we had real ballplayers. Who are these bums? In my day, people were too busy fighting over food to even play baseball. Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural. I want a hot dog. School says you're gonna follow in my footsteps. I think that's great. - You think that's great? - You hate farming, Dad. Grandpa said. Grandpa said? Listen, all that matters is how you feel about it. I like what you do. I like our farm. You're gonna be great at it. Let's get out of here. All right, it's a doozy. All right, gang, let's mask up. - Tom? Murph? Check? - Yeah. Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows? Murph? The ghost. Grab your pillow. You're sleeping in with Tom. It's not a ghost. It's gravity. I'm dropping Tom, then heading to town. You want to clean that up when you've finished praying to it? It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary. Thick is one, thin is zero. Coordinates. Nope. Here we go. Thirty-three. That's it. I can't miss this! Grandpa will be back in a couple hours, Murph. But you don't know what you're gonna find. And that... is why I can't take you. Murph? Grandpa will be home in a while. Tell him I'll call him on the radio. Jesus. - What are you doing? - Heh-heh. Oh, you think this is funny? You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me. Make yourself useful. Hey, Murph? Murph. I think this is the end of the road. Didn't you bring the bolt cutters? That's my girl. Step away! Don't shoot! I'm not armed. My daughter's in the car. Don't be afraid. How did you find this place? Where's my daughter? You had the coordinates for this facility marked on your map. Where did you get them? Where's my daughter? Don't make me take you down again. Sit down! Oh, you still think you're a Marine, pal? Marines don't exist anymore. - And I got grunts like you mowing my grass. - Where did you find those coordinates? But you don't look much like a lawnmower. Think I'll turn you into an overqualified vacuum cleaner. No, you won't. TARS, back down, please. You know, you're taking a risk using ex-military security. They're old, and their control units are unpredictable. It's what the government could spare. Who are you? Dr. Brand. I knew a Dr. Brand once. He was a professor. What makes you think I'm not? Wasn't near as cute, either. Please, Dr. Brand. I don't have any idea what this is. Now I'm scared for my daughter and want her by my side. You give me that, I'll tell you anything you want to know. Get the principals and the girl in the conference room, please. Your daughter is fine. Bright kid. Must have a very smart mother. It's pretty clear you don't want any visitors. So why don't you just let us back up from your fence and we'll be on our way? - It's not that simple. - Well, sure, it is. I don't know anything about you. I don't know anything about this place. Yes, you do. Dad! Hello, Cooper. Professor Brand. Explain to me how you found this facility. Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled upon it. We were on a salvage run... You're sitting in the best-kept secret in the world. Nobody stumbles in here. Nobody stumbles out. Cooper, please. Cooperate with these people. Look. It's kind of hard to explain. We learned these coordinates from an anomaly. What sort of anomaly? I hesitate to term it supernatural, but it definitely wasn't scientific. You're going to have to be specific, Mr. Cooper. Right now. It was gravity. What sort of gravitational anomaly? Where was this? Now, I'm real happy that you're excited about gravity, bud... but you're not getting any answers from us until I get assurances. - Assurances? - Yeah. Like, that we're getting out of here. And I don't mean in the trunk of some car. - Don't you know who we are, Coop? - No, professor, I don't. You know my father, Professor Brand. We're NASA. - NASA? - NASA. The same NASA you flew for. I heard they shut you down, sir... for refusing to drop bombs from the stratosphere onto starving people. When they realized that killing other people was... not a long-term solution, then they needed us back. - In secret. - Why secret? Because public opinion wouldn't allow spending on space exploration. Not while you're struggling to put food on the table. Blight. Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year. Now there's just corn. And we're growing more than we ever have. But like the potatoes in Ireland and the wheat in the Dust Bowl... the corn will die. Soon. We'll find a way, professor. We always have. Driven by the unshakable faith the Earth is ours. Not just ours, no. But it is our home. Earth's atmosphere is percent nitrogen. We don't even breathe nitrogen. Blight does. And as it thrives, our air gets less and less oxygen. The last people to starve will be the first to suffocate. And your daughter's generation... will be the last to survive on Earth. Murph is feeling tired. I was wondering if she could take a nap in my office. Yeah. Thank you. Alright... now you need to tell me what your plan is to save the world. We're not meant to save the world. We're meant to leave it. Rangers. The last components of our one versatile ship in orbit, the Endurance. Our final expedition. You sent people out there looking for a new home? The Lazarus missions. - Oh, that sounds cheerful. - Lazarus came back from the dead. Sure, but he had to die in the first place. There's not a planet in our solar system that could sustain life... and the nearest star's over a thousand years away. That doesn't even qualify as futile. Where'd you send them? Cooper... I can't tell you anymore unless you agree to pilot this craft. - You're the best pilot we ever had. - I barely left the stratosphere. This team never left the simulator. We need a pilot, and this is the mission that you were trained for. Without even knowing it? An hour ago, you didn't even know I was alive. You were going anyway. We had no choice. But something sent you here. - They chose you. - Who's ""they""? How long would I be gone? Hard to know. Years? - I've got kids, professor. - Get out there and save them. Who's ""they""? We started detecting gravitational anomalies almost years ago. Mostly small distortions to our instruments in the upper atmosphere. In fact, I believe you encountered one yourself. Yeah, over the Straights. My crash. Something tripped my fly-by-wire. Exactly. But of all these anomalies, the most significant is this: Out near Saturn... a disturbance of space-time. - Is that a Wormhole? - It appeared years ago. - And it leads where? - Another galaxy. A wormhole's not a naturally occurring phenomenon. Someone placed it there. ""They""? And whoever they are, they appear to be looking out for us. That Wormhole lets us travel to other stars. It came along right as we needed it. They've put potentially habitable worlds right within our reach. Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes. You sent probes into that? We sent people into it. Ten years ago. The Lazarus missions. Twelve possible worlds, twelve Ranger launches carrying... the bravest humans ever to live... led by the remarkable Dr. Mann. Each person's landing pod had enough life support for two years. But they could use hibernation to stretch that... making observations on organics over a decade or more. Their mission was to assess their world, and if it showed potential... then they could send out a signal, bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued. And what if the world didn't show promise? Hence the bravery. You don't have the resources to visit all 12. No. Data transmission back through the Wormhole is rudimentary. Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us some clue as to which worlds have potential. And one system shows promise. One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it? One system with three potential worlds? No long shot. Okay. So if we find a home... - ...then what? - That's the long shot. There's a Plan A and a Plan B. Did you notice anything strange about the launch chamber? This entire facility's a centrifuge. Some kind of vehicle. A space station? - Both. Plan A. - How do you get it off the ground? The first gravitational anomalies changed everything. Suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity was real. So I started working on a theory and we started building this station. But you haven't solved it yet. That's why there's Plan B. The problem is gravity. How to get a viable amount of human life off the planet. This is one way. Plan B: A population bomb. Over 5,000 fertilized eggs weighing in at just under kilos. How would you raise them? With equipment on board, we incubate the first 10. After that, with surrogacy, the growth becomes exponential. Within years, we could have a colony of hundreds. The real difficulty with colonization is genetic diversity. This takes care of that. But what about the people here? You just... You give up on them? My kids? That's why Plan A is a lot more fun. - How far have you got? - Almost there. You're asking me to hang everything... on an almost. I'm asking you to trust me. Find us a new home. And by the time you return... I will have solved the problem of gravity. I give you my word. Go away! Murph. Go! If you're leaving, just go. This world was never enough for you, was it, Coop? What, because heading out there is what I feel like I was born to do? And it excites me? Heh. No, that does not make it wrong. It might. Don't trust the right thing done for the wrong reason. The why of the thing, that's the foundation. And the foundation's solid. We farmers, we sit here every year when the rains fail and we say: ""Next year."" Well, next year ain't gonna save us, nor the one after that. This world's a treasure, Donald, but it's been telling us to leave for a while now. Mankind was born on Earth, it was never meant to die here. Tom will be all right, but you got to make things right with Murph. I will. Without making promises you don't know you can keep. You have to talk to me, Murph. I need to fix this before I go. Then I'll keep it broken so you have to stay. After you kids came along, your mom said something to me I never quite understood. She said, ""Now... we're just here to be memories for our kids."" And I think that now I understand what she meant. Once you're a parent, you're the ghost of your children's future. You said ghosts didn't exist. That's right, Murph. Murph, look at me. I can't be your ghost right now. I need to exist. They chose me. Murph, they chose me. You saw. You're the one who led me to them. That's exactly why you can't go. I figured out the message. - One word. Know what it is? - Murph. ""Stay."" - It says, ""Stay,"" Dad. - Murph. You don't believe me. Look at the books! Look at this. It says, ""Stay."" Why...? You're not listening! It says, ""Stay!"" - No, I'm coming back. - When? One for you, one for me. When I'm up there in hypersleep, or... traveling near the speed of light, or... near a black hole... time's gonna change for me. It's gonna run more slowly. When we get back... we're gonna compare. - Time will run differently for us? - Yeah. By the time I get back, we might even be the same age, you and me. ""What?"" Imagine that! Aw, Murph... You have no idea when you're coming back. No idea at all! Murph, don't... Don't make me leave like this. Come on, Murph! Don't make me leave like this, Murph! Hey... I love you. Forever. You hear me? I love you forever, and I'm coming back. I'm coming back. - How'd it go? - Fine. Just fine. I love you, Tom. - Travel safe? - Yeah. You look after our place for me, all right? All right? - Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone? - You mean your truck? I'll make sure they bring it back. Look after my kids, Donald! Go for main engine start. T-minus 10... - Dad! - ...nine... Dad! ...eight... - seven... - Dad! ...six... five, main engine start, four... three... two... one. Booster ignition and... All engines look good. Beginning roll program. Prepare for stage one separation. Stage one. There is Mach 1. Everybody good? Plenty of slaves for my robot colony? They gave him a humor setting so he'd fit in better with his unit. He thinks it relaxes us. A giant sarcastic robot. What a great idea! I have a cue light I can use when I'm joking if you like. That'd probably help. You can use it to find your way back to the ship after I blow you out the airlock. - What's your humor setting, TARS? - That's percent. Let's bring it on down to 75, please. Stage two separation. All feeds going manual. Going manual. Deactivate probe heater one, two and three. Check. - Taking control. - This is handover to you. - A.D.F. check. - Over. Pull thrusters back. Fuel cells one, two, three. - One hundred percent. - Ex-mites. It's hard leaving everything. My kids. Your father. We're going to be spending a lot of time together. - We should learn to talk. - And when not to. Just being honest. I don't think you need to be that honest. Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter? - Ninety percent. - Ninety percent? Absolute honesty isn't always the most diplomatic, nor the safest form of communication with emotional beings. Okay. Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand. We are coming up on the Endurance. Twelve minutes out. Okay. Taking control. Approaching module port, meters. It's all you, Doyle. Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy. - I feel good. - Take us home. - Lock. - Target locked. - Well done. - Okay, helmets on. Good job. Door's not charging. Never mind. Cooper, you should have control. Control here. Communication with ring module active. Oh, wow. That's initiate. - Are we ready to spin? - Just a sec. - Hello, CASE. - Hello, TARS. All right, we're all set. All right, let's do it. Heh. Thirty percent of spin. One G. How's gravity treating you back there? Well. Romilly? Hey, you okay? - Yeah. - You all right? Yeah, I just need a minute. I think we have some Dramamine in the hab pod, I'm just gonna get that or maybe in the cryo-beds. I'll just be a sec. - Hey, Brand? - Yeah? - Bring a lot. - Heh-heh-heh. Amelia, be safe. - Give my regards to Dr. Mann. - I will, Dad. It looks good for your trajectory. We've calculated two years to Saturn. That's a lot of Dramamine. Look after my family, will you, please, sir? We'll be waiting for you when you get back. A little older, a little wiser, but happy to see you. Do not go gentle into that good night Old age should burn and rave at close of day Rage, rage against the dying of the light Though wise men at their end Know dark is right Because their words had forked No lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night Rage, rage against the dying of the light - You good? - Yeah. Okay, thank you, sir. Here. Pills. So alone. We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse. No, I mean them. It's a perfect planet, and we won't find another one like her. No, it's not like looking for a new condo. The human race is going to be... adrift... desperate for a rock it can cling to while it catches its breath. We need to find that rock. And our three prospects are at the edge of what might sustain human life. Laura Miller's planet is first. - Laura started our biology program. - COOPER: - Wolf Edmunds is here. - Tell me about Edmunds. Oh... Wolf's a particle physicist. None of them had families? No. No attachments. My father insisted. They all knew the odds against ever seeing another human being again. I'm hoping we can surprise at least three of them. - How about Mann? - Dr. Mann? He's remarkable. He's the best of us. He inspired people to follow him on the loneliest journey in human history. Scientists, explorers. That's what I love. You know, out there we face great odds. Death, but... not evil. You don't think nature can be evil? No. Formidable. Frightening. But... ...no, not evil. Is a lion evil because it rips a gazelle to shreds? Just what we take with us, then. Yeah. This crew represents the best of humanity. Even me? You know what? We agreed, percent. There you go. - Don't stay up. - I'll be there in a minute. Just remember, Coop, you are literally wasting your breath. Hey, TARS? Let's go over that trajectory one more time. Eight months to Mars. Counter-orbital slingshot around. Fourteen months to Saturn. Nothing's changed on that. Just let me ask you something. - Dr. Brand and Edmunds... - Why are you whispering? They can't hear you. Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close? I wouldn't know. Is that percent ""wouldn't know"" or percent ""wouldn't know""? I also have a discretion setting, Cooper. But not a poker face, Slick. Hey, guys. Dad's about to go down for the long nap. So I wanted to give you an update. The Earth looks amazing from here. You can't see any of the dust. Heh. I really hope you guys are doing great. I know you're gonna get this message. Professor Brand's assured me that... he's gonna get it to you. Know that I love you. - Is it him? - I don't think so, Murph. You must be Donald. Hello, Murph. Why are you in my dad's truck? He wanted me to bring it for your brother. He sent you a message. She's pretty upset with him for leaving. If you record any messages, I can get them to transmit it to Cooper. Murph is a bright spark. Maybe I should fan the flame. She's already making fools of her teachers. So maybe she should come and make a fool out of you. - So where are they? - Heading for Mars. The next time you hear from Cooper, they'll be coming up on Saturn. ...administration wants me to repeat Plant Pathology. Which sucks. But they said I could start Advanced Agriculture a year early. All right, I got to go, Dad. Hope you're safe up there. Sorry, Coop. I asked Murph to say hi, but she's as stubborn as her old man. I'll try again next time. You all right, Rom? This gets to me, Cooper. This. This. Millimeters of aluminum, that's it, and then nothing... out there for millions of miles won't kill us in seconds. You know that some of the finest... solo yachtsmen in the world don't know how to swim? They don't know how. And if they go overboard, psst, they're done. We're explorers, Rom. This is our boat. Here. This is from the... relay probe? It was in orbit around the Wormhole. This is the Wormhole, and every time we'd come around... we would receive images from the other side of the foreign galaxy. Oh, yeah. Like swinging a periscope around. Exactly. So we got a pretty good idea what we're gonna find on the other side? Navigationally. Guys? Looks like we'll be approaching the Wormhole in about three hours. Hey, Coop? - Can we stop the spinning? - Why? Because we're close enough to see it now? All right. Thanks. There, that's it! That's the Wormhole! Say it, don't spray it, Rom. It's a sphere. Of course it is. What, you...? You thought it would just be a hole? No, it's just that all the illustrations I've ever seen, they... In the illustrations, they're trying to show you how it works. So they say you want to go from here to there. But it's too far, right? So a Wormhole bends space like this, so you can take a shortcut through... a higher dimension. Okay, so... to show that, they've turned three-dimensional space into two dimensions which turns a Wormhole into two dimensions, a circle. What's a circle in three dimensions? - A sphere. - Exactly. A spherical hole. But who put it there? Who do we have to thank? I'm not thanking anybody until we get out of here in one piece, Rom. Any trick to this, Doyle? No one knows. The others made it, right? At least some of them. Everybody ready to say goodbye to our solar system? To our galaxy. Here we go. The controls won't work here. We're passing through the bulk. It's space beyond our three dimensions. All you can do is record and observe. What is that? - I think it's them. - Distorting space-time. Don't! Don't! What was that? The first handshake. We're... We're here. So the lost communications came through. - How? - The relay on this side cached them. So years of basic data. No real surprises. Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up, as has Dr. Mann's. Edmunds' went down three years ago. Transmitter failure? Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up right until it went dark. But Miller's still looks good though, right? - Because she's coming up fast. - DOYLE: With one complication. The planet is much closer to Gargantua than we thought. - Gargantua? - It's what we're calling the black hole. Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets both orbit it. - And Miller's is on the horizon? - As a basketball around a hoop. Landing there takes us dangerously close. And a black hole that big has a huge gravitational pull. Look, I could swing around that neutron star to decelerate. No, it's not that. It's time. The gravity on that planet will slow our clock compared to Earth's drastically. How bad? Every hour we spend on that planet will be... seven years back on Earth. Jesus. Well, that's relativity, folks. Well, we can't just drop down there without... Cooper, we have a mission. Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission, and our mission Plan A is... to find a planet that can habitate the people that are living on Earth right now. You can't just think about your family. Now you have to think bigger than that. I am thinking about my family and millions of other families, okay? Plan A does not work if the people on Earth are dead by the time we pull it off. No. It doesn't. That's why there's a Plan B. Okay. Cooper's right. We need to think of time as a resource, just like oxygen and food. Going down it's gonna cost us. All right, look. Dr. Mann's data is promising, but it's gonna take months to get there. And Edmunds', it's even further. Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has is very promising. It's water, it's organics... - You don't find that every day. - No, you don't. And just think about the resources, including time... that would be spent trying to get back here. - Romilly... - Yeah? ...how far off from Miller's planet do we have to be to stay out of the time shift? Just back from the cusp. All right, which is here, just outside of Miller's planet. - Right. - Okay. Here's Gargantua. Here's Miller's planet. Instead of taking the Endurance into orbit around Miller's planet... which would conserve fuel, but we would lose a lot of time... what if we take a wider orbit around Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet outside of this time shift, to here? Then we take the Ranger down, we get Miller, we get her samples. We come back, we analyze, we debrief. We're in, we're out. We lose a little fuel, but we save a whole lot of time. - That'll work. - That's good. There's no time for monkey business or chit-chat down there. So, TARS, you should definitely stay here. CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay. If we're talking about a couple years, I could use the time to research gravity. Observations from the Wormhole, that's gold to Professor Brand. TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua. Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting, but make sure we stay in range of Miller's planet. - You got it? - I wouldn't leave you behind... Dr. Brand. - You ready, CASE? - Yup. - You don't say much, do you? - TARS talks plenty for both of us. Detach. - Romilly, are you reading these forces? - It's unbelievable. A literal heart of darkness. If we could just see the collapsed star inside... the singularity, yeah, we'd solve gravity. - And we can't get anything from it? - Nothing escapes that horizon. Not even light. - The answer's there, just no way to see it. - There's Miller's planet. Goodbye, Ranger. This is fast for atmospheric entry. - Should we use the thrusters to slow? - No. I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics to save some fuel. Air brake? - We want to get down fast, don't we? - We want to get there in one piece. - Hang on. - Brand, Doyle, get ready. - We should ease! - Hands where I can see them. The only time I went down was when a machine was easing at the wrong time. - A little caution... - Can get you killed, like reckless driving. - Cooper, it's too damn fast! - I got this. - Should I disable the feedback? - No. I need to feel the air. Here we go. It's just water! The stuff of life. Twelve hundred meters. - Do we have a fix on the beacon? - Got it! - Can you maneuver? - I'll need to shave some speed. I'm gonna spiral down on top of it. Everybody hang on! Seven hundred. On my cue, CASE. On my cue. Five hundred meters. Fire! - Very graceful. - No. But very efficient. What are you waiting for? Let's go! Go, go, go! Seven years per hour here. Let's make it count! This way. About meters. The gravity's punishing. Been floating through space too long? 110 Earth gravity. Come on. Come on. - There's nothing here. - Should be right here. If the signal's coming from here, then... Her beacon. Wreckage. Where's the rest? Towards the mountains! Those aren't mountains. They're waves. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. That one's moving away from us. We need the recorder. Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now! We're not leaving without her data. Get back here now! We do not have time! The second wave is coming! We're in the middle of a swell. No, I got it. Get your ass back to the Ranger now! Brand, get back here now! No, Cooper, go. Cooper, go. I can't make it. - Go! - CASE, go get her. - Go! - Get up. Get up, Brand! Go, go! Go! - I'm not gonna make it! - Yes, you are. Yes, you are! Come on, CASE has her! Get back here, Doyle! Come on! Get to the hatch! Go, go! Go! Shit. Manually overriding inside hatch! Cooper! Wait! The engines are flooded! I'm gonna have to shut her down. Holy shit. Hang on! - CASE, what's the problem? - Too waterlogged. Let it drain. Goddamn it! - I told you to leave me! Why didn't you? - And I told you to get your ass back here! - One of us was thinking about the mission! - You were thinking about getting home. I was trying to do the right thing! Can you tell that to Doyle? - CASE, how much time? - Forty-five to an hour. The stuff of life? What's this gonna cost us, Brand? A lot. Decades. What happened to Miller? Judging by the wreckage, she was broken up by a wave soon after impact. How's the wreckage stayed together after all these years? Because of the time slippage. On this planet's time, she just landed hours ago. She probably just died minutes ago. The data Doyle received was just the initial status echoing endlessly. Oh, we are not prepared for this. You eggheads have the survival skills of a Boy Scout troop. Well, we got this far on our brains. Farther than any human in history. Well, not far enough! And now we're stuck here till there won't be anyone left on Earth to save. I'm counting every minute, same as you, Cooper. Is there any possibility... I don't know, some kind of a way we can maybe all jump in a black hole? Gain back the years? Don't shake your head at me. Time is relative, okay? It can stretch and it can squeeze, but... it can't run backwards. It just can't. The only thing that can move across dimensions, like time, is gravity. Okay. The beings that led us here, they communicate... - ...through gravity, right? - Yes. Could they be talking to us from the future? - Maybe. - Okay. If they can... ""They"" are beings of five dimensions. To them, time might be another physical dimension. To them... the past might be a canyon that they can climb into and the future... a mountain they can climb up. But to us, it's not, okay? Look, Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry. - But you knew about relativity. - Oh. Brand... my daughter was years old. I couldn't teach her Einstein's theories before I left. Couldn't you have told her you were going to save the world? No. When you become a parent, one thing becomes really clear. And that is that you want to make sure your children feel safe. And it rules out telling a 10-year-old that the world is ending. Cooper? - How long for the engines, CASE? - A minute or two. We don't have it. Helmets on! Brand, co-pilot, you're up. CASE, blow the cabin oxygen through the main thrusters! - We're gonna spark it. - Roger that. - Locked. - Depressurizing. Engines up! Hello, Rom. I've waited years. How...? How many years? - By now it must be... - Twenty-three years... four months, eight days. Doyle? I thought I was prepared. I knew the theory. Reality's different. And Miller? There's nothing here for us. Why didn't you sleep? Oh, I had a couple of stretches. But I stopped believing you were coming back. And something seemed wrong about dreaming my life away. I learned what I could from the black hole... but I couldn't send anything to your father. We've been receiving, but nothing gets out. - Is he alive? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. We've got years of messages stored. Cooper. Messages span years. Play it from the beginning. Hey, Dad. Checking in. Saying hi. Finished second in school. Miss Kurling's still giving me C's though. Pulled me down, but seconds not bad. Grandpa attended the ceremony. Oh. I met another girl, Dad. I... I really think this is the one. Name's Lois. That's her right there. Murphy stole Grandpa's car. She crashed it. She's okay, though. Hey, Dad. Look at this! You're a grandpa. His name's Jesse. I kind of wanted to call him Coop, but Lois says... maybe next time. Donald says he's already earned the ""great"" part, so we just leave it at that. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Say ""Bye-bye, Grandpa."" Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay. Sorry it's been a while. Just... what with Jesse and all. Grandpa died last week. We buried him out in the back forty next to Mom and... Jesse. Which is where we would have buried you if you'd ever... come back. Murph was there at the funeral. We don't see her that much, but she came for that. You aren't listening to this, I know that. All these messages are just, like... drifting out there in the darkness. Lois says that... I have to let you go. And... So... I guess I'm letting you go. I don't know where you are, Dad... but I hope that you're at peace. Goodbye. Hey, Dad. Hey, Murph. You son of a bitch. I never made one of these when you were still responding... because I was so mad at you for leaving. And then when you went quiet, it... seemed like I should live with that decision. And I have. But today's my birthday. And it's a special one, because you told me... You once told me that when you came back, we might be the same age. And today I'm the age you were when you left. So it would be a real good time for you to come back. I didn't mean to intrude. It's just that I've never seen you in here before. I've never been in here before. I talk to Amelia all the time. It helps. - I'm glad you've started. - I haven't. I... I just had something I needed to get out. - I know they're still out there. - I know. There are so many reasons their communications might not be getting through. I know, professor. I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of. Them never coming back or... coming back to find we've failed. Then let's succeed. So... back to the fourth iteration. Let's run it through some new fields. With respect, professor, we've tried that hundreds of times. It only has to work once, Murph. Every rivet that they strike could have been a bullet. We've done well for the world here... whether or not we crack the equation before I kick the bucket. - Don't be morbid, professor. - I'm not afraid of death. I'm an old physicist. I'm afraid of time. Time. You're afraid of time. We've been trying to solve the equation... without changing the underlying assumption about time. - And? - And that means... each iteration is an attempt to prove its own proof. It's recursive. It's nonsensical. Are you calling my life's work... nonsense, Murph? No, I'm saying that you've been trying to... finish it with one arm... No, with both arms tied behind your back. And I don't understand why. I'm an old man, Murph. Can we take this point up at another time? I want to talk to my daughter. Stepping out into the universe... we must confront the reality of interstellar travel. We must reach far beyond our own lifespans. We must think not as individuals but as a species. Do not go gentle into that good night TARS kept the Endurance right where we needed her. But the trip took years longer than we anticipated. We no longer have the fuel to visit both prospects, so... we have to choose. But how? They're both promising. Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann is the one still transmitting, so... We've no reason to suspect Edmunds's data would have soured. His world has key elements to sustain human life. - As does Dr. Mann's. - Cooper, this is my field. And... I really believe Edmunds' is the better prospect. - Why? - Gargantua, that's why. Look at Miller's planet. Hydrocarbons, organics, yes... but no life. Sterile. We'll find the same thing on Mann's. Because of the black hole? Murphy's Law. Whatever can happen will happen. Accident is the first building block of evolution. But when you're orbiting a black hole not enough can happen. It sucks in asteroids and comets, other events which would otherwise reach you. We need to go further afield. You once said that Dr. Mann... was the best of us. He's remarkable. We're only here because of him. And yet... Yet here he is. He's on the ground, and he's sending a very unambiguous message, telling us to come to his planet. Granted, but Edmunds' data is more promising. We should vote. Well, if we vote, there's something you should know. Brand? He has a right to know. That has nothing to do with it. - What does? - She's in love with Wolf Edmunds. - Is that true? - Yes. And that makes me want to follow my heart. But maybe we've spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory. You're a scientist, Brand. So listen to me... when I say that love isn't something we invented. It's... observable, powerful. It has to mean something. Love has meaning, yes. Social utility, social bonding, child rearing... We love people who have died. Where's the social utility in that? None. Maybe it means something more, something we can't... yet understand. Maybe it's some evidence, some... artifact of a higher dimension that we can't consciously perceive. I'm drawn across the universe to someone I haven't seen in a decade... who I know is probably dead. Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving... that transcends dimensions of time and space. Maybe we should trust that, even if we can't understand it yet. All right, Cooper... yes... the tiniest possibility of seeing Wolf again excites me. That doesn't mean I'm wrong. Honestly, Amelia... it might. TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's. We'll lose about a third again. But next year... Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm and we'll make it up. What happened to Nelson? Murph, have you eaten enough? Would you like some more souffle? Oh, no. I'm full, thanks. It was delicious. Coop, finish your fritter, please. Will you spend the night? Your room is exactly as you left it. It's ready. I need to get back. My sewing machine is in there, but there's plenty... I need to... Too many memories. We might have something for that. Hey, Coop. The dust. Lois, I have a friend who... could look at his lungs. - Amelia, I'm sorry. - You were just being objective. Unless you're punishing me for screwing up on Miller's planet. No, this wasn't a personal decision. If you're wrong, you will have a very personal decision to make. Your fuel calculations are based on a return journey. Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have to decide whether to return home... or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B. Starting a colony could save us from extinction. You might have to decide between seeing your children again... and the future of the human race. I trust you'll be as objective then. He's been asking for you since he came to. We were trying to reach you. Murph. I'm here, professor. I let you all down. No, you got us so far. Real close. I'll finish what you started. Good, good Murph. You had faith... all those... all those years. I... I asked you to have faith. I wanted you to believe... that your father... would come back. I do, professor. - Forgive me, Murph. - There's nothing to forgive. I... I lied, Murph. I lied to you. There was no need for him to... To come back. There is no way to help us. But Plan A... All this. All these people. And the equation. Did my father know? Did he leave me? Do... not... go... gentle... No. No! You can't leave. You... No. Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that your father died today. He had no pain. He was at peace. I'm very sorry for your loss. Brand, did you know? He told you, right? You knew. This was all a sham. You left us here. To suffocate. To starve. Frozen cloud. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Pray you never learn... just how good it can be to see another face. I hadn't a lot of hope to begin with, but... after so long, I had none. My supplies were completely exhausted. The last time I went to sleep, I didn't even set a waking date. You have literally raised me from the dead. Lazarus. - What about the others? - I'm afraid you're it, sir. So far, surely. No, our present situation is that there's very little chance of rescuing any others. Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann? Tell us about your world. Our world, we hope. Our world... is cold... stark... but undeniably beautiful. The days are hours long, cold. The nights are... far colder hours. The gravity is a very, very pleasant percent of the Earth's. Now, up here where I landed, the water is alkali... and the air has too much ammonia to breathe for more than just a few minutes... but down at the surface, and there is a surface... the chlorine dissipates. The ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons and breathable air. To organics. Possibly even to life. We might be sharing this world. These readings are from the surface? Over the years, I've dropped various probes. - How far have you explored? - I've mounted several major expeditions. But with oxygen in limited supply, KIPP there really did most of the legwork. - What went wrong with him, sir? - Degeneration. He misidentified the first organics we found as ammonia crystals. We struggled on for a time, but ultimately I decommissioned him and... used his power source to keep the mission going. I thought I was alone before I shut him down. Would you like me to look at him? No. No. He needs a human touch. Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message for you from the comm station. Okay. Be right there. Excuse me. Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that your father died today. He had no pain. He was at peace. I'm sorry for your loss. Is that Murph? She's... She's grown. Brand, did you know? He told you, right? You knew. This was all a sham. You left us here. To suffocate. To starve. Did my father know too? Dad? I just want to know... if you left me here to die. I just have to know. Cooper, my... My father dedicated... his whole life to Plan A. I have no idea what she's talking about. I do. He never even hoped to get the people off the Earth? No. But he's been trying to solve the gravity equation for years. Amelia, your father solved his equation before I even left. Then why wouldn't he use it? The equation couldn't reconcile relativity with quantum mechanics. You need more. More? More what? More data. You need to see into a black hole. The laws of nature prohibit a naked singularity. Romilly, is that true? If a black hole is an oyster, then the singularity's the pearl inside. The gravity's so strong, it's always hidden in darkness... behind the horizon. That's why we call it a black hole. Okay, but if we see beyond the horizon... We can't, Coop. There are some things that aren't meant to be known. Your father had to find another way to save the human race from extinction. - Plan B. A colony. - Why not tell people? - Why keep building those stations? - He knew how hard it would be... to get people to work together to save the species instead of themselves. - Or their children. - Bullshit. You never would've come here unless you believed you would save them. Evolution has yet to transcend that simple barrier. We can care deeply, selflessly about those we know, but that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight. But the lie. That monstrous lie? Unforgivable. And he knew that. He was prepared to destroy his own humanity in order to save the species. - He made an incredible sacrifice. - No. An incredible sacrifice is being made by the people on Earth who are gonna die! Because in his fucking arrogance... he declared their case hopeless. I'm sorry, Cooper... their case is hopeless. No. No. We are the future. Cooper, what can I do? Let me go home. You're absolutely positive? His solution was correct. He'd had it for years. - It's worthless? - It's half the answer. Okay, how do you find the other half? Out there? A black hole. - But stuck down here on Earth? - Yeah? I'm not sure you can. God, they just pack up and leave. What are they hoping to find? Survival. Damn it. Murph, don't...? Don't people have a right to know? Panic won't help. We just have to keep working, same as ever. But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand was manipulating us to do? Brand gave up on us. I'm still trying to solve this. So... do you have an idea? A feeling. I told you about my ghost. My dad thought I called it a ghost... because I was scared of it. But I was never scared of it. I called it a ghost because it felt... It felt like a person. It was trying to tell me something. If there's an answer here on Earth, it's back there... somehow, in that room. So I have to find it. We're running out of time. What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers? No, they can stay. I'll be sleeping anyway. - Hey, Coop? - Yeah? I have a suggestion for your return journey. - Yeah, what's that? - Have one last crack at the black hole. I'm going home, Rom. Yeah, I know. This isn't going to cost you any time. There's a chance for the people on Earth. - Talk to me. - Gargantua's an older spinning black hole. - It's what we call a gentle singularity. - Gentle? They're hardly gentle. But the tidal gravity is so quick that... something crossing the horizon fast might survive. A probe, say. - What happens after it crosses? - After the horizon is a complete mystery. So, what's to say there isn't some way that the probe... can glimpse the singularity and relay the quantum data? If he's equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse. Just when did this probe become a ""he,"" professor? TARS is the obvious candidate. I've already told him what to look for. I'd need the old optical transmitter off KIPP, Cooper. You'd do this for us? Before you get all teary, remember that as a robot I have to do anything you say. - Your cue light's broken. - I'm not joking. I'm gonna need TARS to remove and adapt some components from KIPP. I don't want to disturb his archival functions. I'll supervise. All right. Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure sites. One for Brand's lab, two for habitat. Once those modules have landed, you don't want to move them. I can take you to the probe sites, but I don't think... these conditions are gonna hold. I think we should wait. CASE is headed down with the rest of the distillery equipment. I'd really like to secure those sites by nightfall. Well, these squalls do usually blow over. Okay, then. - You'll need a long-range transmitter. - Got it. - Are you charged? - Yeah. Follow me. - TARS, hours, yeah? - Roger that, Cooper. Brand told me why you feel you have to go back. But I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mention... that a mission such as ours could certainly use an extra engineer. You better slow down, turbo. Safety first, CASE, remember. Safety first, Cooper. I have to tell you, Dr. Mann, I'm honored to be a part of this. But once we set up base camp and secure those modules, my work's done here. I'm going home. You have attachments. But even without a family... I can promise you that that yearning to be with other people is powerful. That emotion is at the foundation... of what makes us human. It's not to be taken lightly. - How long have you had that cough? - A while. Mom lets me play in here. I don't touch your stuff. Just take this gently. You know why we couldn't just send machines on these missions, don't you, Cooper? A machine doesn't improvise well because you can't program a fear of death. Our survival instinct is our single greatest source of inspiration. Take you, for example. A father... with a survival instinct that extends to your kids. What does research tell us is the last thing you're going to see before you die? Your children. Their faces. At the moment of death, your mind's gonna push a little bit harder to survive. For them. Deep breath. Hey. I bet you're Coop. Why don't you have a seat here for me? It's bad. They cannot stay here. - Okay? - Yeah. TARS, what's taking so long? Professor, I am having trouble completing the boot up. I don't understand. It's funny. When I left Earth... I thought I was prepared to die. The truth is... I never really considered the possibility that my planet wasn't the one. Nothing worked out the way it was supposed to. Let's go. All right, buddy, give me a big deep breath. What is this? - What are you doing? - I'm sorry! I can't let you leave with that ship. We're gonna need it to complete the mission... once the others realize what this place isn't. We cannot survive here. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! - They can't stay here anymore. - You have to leave right now. Let me make something abundantly clear. You have a responsibility... - Oh! Jesus! - Coop, get her stuff. She's going home. Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb, Tom! Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did. And he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse. You faked all the data? Yeah. There's no surface? No. I tried to do my duty, Cooper... but I knew the day that I arrived here that this place had nothing. And I resisted the temptation for years... but I knew that... if I just pressed that button, then... somebody would come and save me. You fucking coward. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Listen, if you're not going to go, let your family go. Just save your family. And we go live underground with you? Pray that Daddy comes to save us? Dad's not coming back. He never was coming back. It's up to me. You're gonna save everybody? Because Dad couldn't do it. Dad didn't even try! Dad just abandoned us! He left us here to die. Nobody's going with you. You gonna wait for your next kid to die? Get out. And don't come back. You can keep my stuff. Stop it! No. No! Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance you're gonna kill yourself! Those are the best odds I've had in years. Don't judge me, Cooper. You were never tested like I was. Few men have been. You tried your best, Murph. You're feeling it, aren't you? The survival instinct. That's what drove me. It's what drives all of us. And it's what's gonna save us. Because I want to save all of us. For you, Cooper. I'm sorry, I can't watch you go through this. I'm sorry. I thought I could, but I can't. I'm here. I'm here for you. Just listen to my voice, Cooper. I'm right here. You're not alone. Do you see your children? It's okay. They're right there with you. Did Professor Brand tell you that poem before you left? Do you remember? Do not go gentle into that good night Old age should burn and rave At close of day Rage, rage against the dying of the light Brand! Help! - Help! - Cooper? CASE! No air. Ammonia. Cooper. Cooper, we're coming! CASE! - I have a fix. - Go! Go, go, go! And away! Cooper, we're coming. Hang in there. Don't talk. Try to breathe as little as possible. We're almost there. There's a security lockout, sir. It requires a person to access function. It's all yours, sir. Try not to breathe. We're coming. We're coming right now. CASE, come on! Come on! We got to go faster, CASE! Faster, faster, faster! Hang in there. Come on. I see him, I see him! CASE, bank! Bank right! Cooper! Cooper! I'm here! This data makes no sense. I'm sorry. - What? - Mann was lying! Go. Go. Romilly. Romilly! Romilly! Do you read me, Romilly? Step back, professor! Step back! - Romilly... - Romilly, do you read me? Keep watch! Lois? - What happened to caution, CASE? - Safety first, Cooper. Romilly? Romilly, do you read me? This is Brand. Romilly? Dr. Brand. Cooper. There's been an explosion. Dr. Mann's compound. TARS, TARS, o'clock! Let me know when TARS is aboard. Romilly did not survive. I could not save him. - TARS is in. - I'll take her now. - Do we have a fix on the Ranger? - He's pushing into orbit! If he takes control of that ship, we're dead. - He'd maroon us? - He is marooning us. I'll meet you guys downstairs. Go wait by the car. Come on! Give me your bag. Get in the backseat. Get in the backseat now! Dr. Mann, please respond. Dr. Mann, please respond! He doesn't know the Endurance docking procedure. - The autopilot does. - Not since TARS disabled it. Nice. - What's your trust setting, TARS? - Lower than yours apparently. Do not attempt docking. I repeat, do not attempt docking. Please res... Auto-docking sequence withheld. - Override. - Unauthorized. Override. Unauthorized. Do not attempt docking. I repeat, do not attempt docking. Please resp... Moving slowly toward the Endurance. Imperfect contact. - Override. - Hatch lockout. - Is he locked on yet? - Imperfectly. Dr. Mann, do not... Hatch lockout disengaged. Dr. Mann, do not, I repeat, do not open the hatch. I repeat, do not open the hatch. If you open the hatch, the airlock will depressurize. - What happens if he blows the airlock? - Nothing good. Okay, pull back. Retro thrusters, everything we've got, CASE! - Thrusters are full! - Back! Relay my transmission to the onboard computer... and have it rebroadcast as emergency P.A. Dr. Mann... I repeat, do not open the inner hatch. I repeat... Brand? I don't know what he said to you... but I am taking command of the Endurance. And then we can talk about completing the mission. Dr. Mann, listen to me. This is not about my life. Or Cooper's life. This is about all mankind. There is a moment... It is not sa... Oh, my God. - There's no point using fuel to chase... - Analyze the Endurance's spin. - Cooper, what are you doing? - Docking. Endurance rotation is 67, RPM. Okay, get ready to match our spin with the retro thrusters. - It's not possible. - No... it's necessary. Endurance is hitting stratosphere! She's got no heat shield. - CASE, you ready? - Ready. Cooper! This is no time for caution. CASE, if I black out, you take the stick. TARS, get ready to engage the docking mechanism. - Endurance is starting to heat. - Twenty feet out. I need three degrees starboard, Cooper. Ten feet out. Cooper, we are lined up. Initiating spin! Come on, TARS. Come on, TARS! - We are locked, Cooper. - Locked. Easing up! Easy. Easy. Retro thrusters! Main engines on. Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby. Killing main engines! Okay, we're out of orbit. Okay. And for our next trick! It'll have to be good. We're heading into Gargantua's pull. Oh, shit. - CASE, take the stick. - Roger that. Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua. Shall I use main engines? No. We got to let her slide as far as we can. - Give it to me. - There's good news, there's bad news. Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS. Give it to me straight. The backup generator kicked in, so the system's stable. They're all good. Good. Okay. The navigational hub has been completely destroyed. We don't have enough life support to make it back to Earth, but... I think we can scratch our way to Edmunds' planet. - What about fuel? - Not enough. But I have a plan. We let Gargantua pull us down close to her horizon. Then a powered slingshot around, launching us towards Edmunds' planet. - Manually? - That's what I'm here for. I'm gonna take us just inside the critical orbit. - What about time slippage? - Neither of us has time to worry... about relativity right now, Dr. Brand. I'm sorry, Cooper. Once we've gathered enough speed around Gargantua... we use Lander 1... and Ranger as rocket boosters to... push us out of the black hole's gravity. The Lender's linkages have been destroyed... so we'll have to control manually. Once Lander is spent, TARS will detach... And get sucked into that black hole. Why does TARS have to detach? We have to shed the weight to escape the gravity. Newton's third law. The only way humans have ever figured out of getting somewhere... is to leave something behind. Cooper, you can't ask TARS to do this for us. He's a robot. So you don't have to ask him to do anything. - Cooper, you asshole! - Sorry, you broke up a little bit there. It's what we intended, Dr. Brand. It's our only chance to save people on Earth. If I can find a way to transmit the quantum data I'll find in there... they might still make it. Let's just hope there's still someone there to save. Maximum velocity achieved. Prepare to fire escape thrusters. - Ready? - Ready. - Ready. - Main engine ignition in three... two... one. Mark. Come on, baby. Lander engines, on my mark. Three, two... one. Mark. Ranger engines, on my mark. Three, two, one... - Mark. - Fire! This little maneuver's gonna cost us years! You don't sound so bad for pushing 120! Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark. Three, two... - one. Mark. - Detach! - Goodbye, TARS. - Goodbye, Dr. Brand. - See you on the other side, Coop. - See you there, Slick! Okay, CASE. - Nice reckless flying! - Learned from the master. - Ranger 2, prepare to detach. - What? No! No! Cooper! What are you doing? Newton's third law. You got to leave something behind. You told me we had enough resources for both of us. We agreed, Amelia... percent. Don't. Detach. Okay, I am nosing down. Approaching the event horizon. Portside, dipping down beneath it to go through it. Heading towards blackness. I have a visual of the event. It's all black. TARS, do you read me? It's all blackness. TARS! Do you read me? Over. Okay. Screens... getting interference. Losing control of the stick. I got flashes. Flashes of lightness and blackness. The turbulence in the gravity is increasing. The computers are going down. Agh. Gravitational pull. I'm losing control of the stick. Murph? Murph, come on! Eject. Eject. Eject. Eject. Eject. Eject. Murph. Murph! Murph! Murph! Murph. No, no, no! Murph! Murph! No! No! If you're leaving, just go. No, no. No. No, don't go. Don't go, you idiot. Don't go! Morse. Morse. Morse. Dot. Dot. S. T. A. Dash! Dash! Dash! Murph! Murph, we don't have time for this! Come on! Y. ""Stay!"" Come on. Come on, Murph. Come on! What's it say? What's it say, Murph? What's it say? ""Stay."" Tell him, Murph. Make him stay. Make him stay, Murph. Make him stay, Murph. Don't let me leave, Murph! Don't let me leave, Murph! No! No! No! It was you. You were my ghost. Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper. - TARS? - Roger that. - You survived. - Somewhere... in their fifth dimension. They saved us. Yeah? Who the hell is ""they""? And just why would they want to help us? I don't know, but they constructed this three-dimensional space... inside their five-dimensional reality to allow you to understand it. Yeah, that ain't working. Yes, it is. You've seen that time is represented here as a physical dimension. You have worked out that you can exert a force across space-time. Gravity to send a message. Affirmative. Gravity... can cross the dimensions, including time. Apparently. Do you have the quantum data? Roger. I have it. I am transmitting it on all wavelengths, but nothing is getting out, Cooper. I can do this. I can do this. But such complicated data to a child? Not just any child. What else? Oh, come on, Dad. Murph, the fire's out! Come on! Even if you communicate it here, she won't understand its significance for years. I get that, TARS. But we've got to figure something out or the people on Earth are gonna die. Think! Cooper... they didn't bring us here to change the past. Say that again. They didn't bring us here to change the past. No, they didn't bring us here at all. We brought ourselves. TARS, give me the coordinates for NASA in binary. In binary. Roger. Feeding data. ""It's not a ghost."" ""It's gravity."" Don't you get it yet, TARS? I brought myself here! We're here to communicate with the three-dimensional world. We're the bridge! I thought they chose me. - But they didn't choose me, they chose her. - For what, Cooper? To save the world. All of this is one little girl's bedroom. Every moment. It's infinitely complex. They have access to infinite time and space, but they're not bound by anything! They can't find a specific place in time. They can't communicate. That's why I'm here. I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph... just like I found this moment. - How, Cooper? - Love, TARS, love. It's just like Brand said. My connection with Murph, it is quantifiable. It's the key! What are we here to do? Find how to tell her. The watch. The watch. That's it. We code the data into the movement of the second hand. TARS, translate the data into Morse and feed it to me. Translating data to Morse. Cooper, what if she never came back for it? She will. She will. Murph, I can see his car! He's coming, Murph! Okay. I'm coming down. How do you know? Because I gave it to her. Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot. Dot-dot... dash-dot. Dot-dash-dot-dot. Dot-dash-dot-dot. Dash-dash-dash. Dash, dash, dash. He came back! It was him all the time! I didn't know. It was him! Dad's gonna save us. Eureka! It's traditional. Eureka! Did it work? I think it might have. How do you know? Because the bulk beings are closing the tesseract. Don't you get it yet, TARS? They're not ""beings."" They're us. What I've been doing for Murph, they're doing for me. For all of us. Cooper, people couldn't build this. No. No, not yet. But one day. Not you and me. But people. A civilization that's evolved past the four dimensions we know. What happens now? Mr. Cooper. All right. Let's take it slow, sir. Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper. Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore. Actually, you are years old. Take it slow, sir. You were... extremely lucky. The Rangers found you with only minutes left in your oxygen supply. Where am I? Cooper Station. Currently orbiting Saturn. Cooper Station. Nice of you to name it after me. What? The station isn't named after you, sir. It's... named after your daughter. Although she's always maintained just how important you were. Is she still alive? She'll be here in a couple weeks. She is far too old to be transferring from another station... but when she heard that you'd been found... well, this is... Murphy Cooper we're talking about. Yes, it is. We'll have you checked out of here in a couple days. I'm sure you'll be excited to see what's in store. I actually... did a paper on you in high school. I know all about your life back on Earth. Oh, yeah. Right. If... If you'll follow me, we've got a really good situation for you. So... when I made my suggestion to Miss Cooper... I was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect. It was just constant. Just that steady blow of dirt. Of course, I didn't speak to her personally. We always set the plate upside-down. Glasses or cups, whatever it was, upside-down. Well, my dad was a farmer. Like everybody else back then. There just wasn't enough food. We wore little things, little strips... of sheet over our nose and mouth so we wouldn't breathe so much of it. Well, it was pretty exciting for me because it was hope. I don't care who describes it, there is no way for it to be exaggerated. She did confirm just how much you loved farming. - Oh, she did, did she? - Yeah. Come here. Home sweet home. Everything replaced and put back where it... - Hey, is this...? - Oh, yeah. The machine we found out near Saturn when we found you. Yes. Its... power source was shot, but we could get you another one. Yes. Please. Settings. General settings. Security settings. Honesty, new setting: percent. Confirmed. Additional customization? Humor: percent. Confirmed. Auto self-destruct T-minus 10, nine... Let's make that percent. Sixty percent confirmed. - Knock-knock. - You want 55? Is this really what it was like? It was never this clean, Slick. Heh. I don't care much for this pretending we're back where we started. I want to know where we are. Where we're going. - Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there. - Yeah. Family? Yeah, they all came out to see her. She's been in cryo-sleep for almost two years. You told them I like farming. It was me, Murph. I was your ghost. I know. People didn't believe me. They thought that I was doing it all myself. But... I knew who it was. Nobody believed me. But I knew you'd come back. How? Because my dad promised me. Well, I'm here now, Murph. I'm here. No. No parent should have to watch their own child die. I have my kids here for me now. You go. Where? Brand. She's out there... setting up camp. Alone... in a strange galaxy. Maybe right now she's settling in for the long nap... by the light of our new sun... in our new home."
73,2005,The Weather Man,American,"A successful weatherman at a Chicago news program, David Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is well paid but garners little respect from people in the area who throw fast food at him, David suspects, because they're resentful of how easy his high-paying job is. Dave also feels overshadowed by his father, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Spritzel (Michael Caine), who is disappointed in Dave's apparent inability to grow up and deal with his two children. The situation worsens when Robert is diagnosed with lymphoma and given only a few months to live. As he becomes more and more depressed, Dave takes up archery, finding the activity a way to build his focus and calm his nerves.
David later remembers a conversation between himself and his father, where his father explains to him that ""the hardest thing to do and the right thing to do are often the same thing"" and that ""nothing that has meaning is easy"". David appreciates this advice but struggles to implement it.
To prove himself to his father and possibly reconcile with Noreen (Hope Davis), his estranged wife, Dave pursues a weatherman position with a national talk show called Hello America. The job would nearly quadruple his salary, but means relocating to New York City. When Hello America invites him to New York, he takes his daughter, Shelly (Gemmenne de la Peña), with him and bonds with her by helping her shop for a more suitable wardrobe. While away, Dave learns that his son Mike (Nicholas Hoult) attacked his counselor, Don Bowden (Gil Bellows), claiming that the man wanted to perform oral sex on him. Despite this stress and an all-night drinking binge, Dave impresses the Hello America interviewers and is eventually offered the job.
When he returns, Dave slaps Russ (Michael Rispoli), Noreen's boyfriend, when he finds him dealing with his son's predicament. Dave later confronts the counselor at his home, beating him up and warning him that he is in store for worse.
The family holds a living funeral for Robert (organised by Dave's mother, Lauren, played by Judith McConnell), in which Dave asks Noreen to reconcile and move to New York, but she has decided to marry Russ. Dave and Robert have one final talk, in which Dave breaks down in tears, unsure of his life's choices. Robert consoles him, telling him that he has time to ""chuck"" the garbage of his life. Robert dies soon after.
The film ends several months later, after Dave has accepted the job and moved to New York. People have ceased throwing things at him though, he muses, this may be a pleasant side-effect of his archery hobby, for which he carries a bow.",6.6,tt0384680,"That was refreshing. I'm refreshed. I'm refreshing. Welcome back. I'm Bryant Gumbel. - And I'm Anne Howard. - Good stuff today. - We're going to be busy. - We've got pop superstar Elton John. He's going to be with us. And so, too, will best-selling author Al Franken. Along with some super-smart fourth graders... with a great idea for getting schoolbooks... to kids who really need them. But here's an idea whose time has come. Why don't we just start with... ...and fill the tart shell. Bryant, you put some ice cream on our angel food cake... - How much do you want? - As much as you like. What are you laughing about? This is Baked Alaska. - This is supposed to be low-fat. - It is! Did they call? Someone from the show. The Gumbel show. They didn't call? Are you sure? - Once again, we're out of time. - Thank you. Already? We still got lots more ahead this morning. We're going to be back... - What's up, dude? - Next person in line. What's up? - Hey, can I get your autograph? - Next in line. I'm not who you think I am, so... You're not the weather guy? Dan Spritz? Dave Spritz. I'm not Dave Spritz, no. But I hear that a lot. You don't have to be a dick. Look, can you just... All right, I'm just waiting in line. Bro, I can read your vehicle registration form. So, whatever. Can you... All right, can you give me a break? I just wanted to wait in line. You're on TV, bro. You're on TV. - You're on TV, bro. - So what? You keep saying that. So you're on TV, bro. Go work in a bank or something... if you don't wanna be cool to people. Whatever. Just... Can you get out of my face? Can you get out of my face? - Asshole. - You want to say that to my face? I thought you wanted me to get out of your face. People recognize me sometimes. Some are dicks. This is the same system that created those strong snowfalls in Minnesota. It's meant some slightly warmer weather... I should cool out a little, I guess. I mean, I'm not just this two-dimensional guy they recognize. I do have a relationship to them. I let them know what they have to deal with. But listen, these warmer temperatures are not going to last. This wind system will keep pushing colder air across the Midwest... I guess that's why they think they know me. But they don't, really. .. our Spritz Nipper of the week with a high of just 24. I'm not a hill of beans. I have a plan. Okay, see you then. - What's this afternoon? - You're picking up Shelly. - Where? - Chicago Dance. Then you're taking your dad to Northwestern. At 3:00? Do you have that Hello America stuff? - The letter? - Yeah. You have Mike, too. 5:30 at the Norris house. Okay. Do they have my cell phone? Well, they should have all the numbers in case. And am I supposed to call that guy Dersen? Didn't he want me to call to touch base? Okay. - Dad, can we stop here? - What for? I need a notebook for school. I'll just walk home. Okay. - Can I have some money? - You don't have any? No. You're years old. You shouldn't be walking around without money, okay, Shelly? You're not a kid. - How's your mom doing? - She's good. Can I have a pack of Lights? - Regulars? - The 100s. Strikes? How's Shelly? She's doing great. - Little angel. - Yeah. She's doing great. - Who's an angel? - Shelly. Shelly is grossly overweight and unhappy. I'm concerned about her, as I am Michael. - David. - Yeah, Dad. Robert Spritzel? Would you get me a paper... - for the way back, Son? - Yeah. Fifteen minutes? Yes. I'll see you then. Fuck. - Hey. - Hey. - It's getting cold. - Yeah. - What's the Nipper this week? - Thursday. Thursday's the Nipper? All right. Here. Yeah, can I get some change? Not really. Can I just get some quarters? I just need a quarter for a paper. Not really. All right. I'll get something then. All right. Small coffee. It's cents. No, it says 0.72. After the whole everything, it's 0.80. - Hey. - Hi. Where's the paper, David? I didn't have enough money. You bought a coffee. - What? - You bought a coffee. Yeah, that, and then I didn't have enough money after. What? I didn't have enough money after I bought the coffee, so... You should carry more than 1, David. You're a grown man. Let me just move this letter from Hello America. My father is Robert King Spritzel. He won the National Book Award when he was 28. And the Pulitzer when he was 33. President Carter called him a national treasure. They played racquetball in a regular game. He was a great writer. But what was the cost? Did he neglect his family? No, he didn't. He was a fine father. More than that, really. It's fruitless for Shelly to be dancing. She should find another interest that would be more rewarding to her... that she can take more from, David. - We've talked about that. - Well, you should do something, Son. We've tried a couple things. We'll keep trying, so... How's Michael? I think that was an overreaction on Noreen's part. I don't think he has a problem with pot. Let's hope. How's the weather business? Last September... I had encouraged Shelly to explore some other activities and interests. She picked archery. So I took her to an archery range in Bolingbrook. It was a 90-minute drive. We purchased a junior bow-arrow kit... and a leather wristforearm guard. Okay, we'll take that. And private lessons. All right, Shelly. You take that one... and go right ahead. All right. Okay, just remember... pull it straight back, parallel to your ear, okay? You can do it, Shelly. We purchased a five-pack lesson plan. We haven't been back. Hello? - Hey. - Hey. Can you pick up Mike at the mall on North? I thought he was at a friend's house. Paul Norris. They went to the mall. He just called me. - He finished his rehab. - Okay. - That's one of my counselors. - In your program? Don Boden. He's pretty nice. - He swears all the time, though. - Swears? Yeah. To relate, I guess. But he's pretty nice. Hey, Don. - What are you guys doing? - Looking for clothes. You're just looking for clothes. - Yeah. - That's great. I'm looking for clothes. Okay. - This is Paul. - What's up? Hey. It's cold today. - Yeah. - Yeah, no kidding. What is it, like, or something? Yeah, like 22. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. Hey. - Yeah, I like this. - It's good-looking. Yeah, I've been looking for something like this. Chuck it in here. - What? - Chuck it in. I'm loading up. I got a discount card. I'll get it for you. - That's all right. - Mike, big deal. - I can get it. - Bro, I got a serious discount. It's gonna cost, like, 7. - I'm gonna take off. Nice to meet you. - You, too. That's my dad. I'll see you later. Sure. I'll catch you later. - Hey. - Hey. - Who's that? - Don Boden. - Who's Don Boden? - He's one of my counselors. Oh. - That's a nice sweater. - Thanks. I'll walk you up. Hi. Hi. Thanks for getting Mike. - Hey, how was your thing? - It was good. - I'll see you, Dad. - Okay, Mike. - I think he's gonna be okay. - Well, we'll see. What's new? Nothing much. I got a feeler from Hello America. - What? - I got a feeler. Dales is leaving it. I might get called to audition. New York. - Lf I get called. - That's good. What about the kids? It's just a shot in the dark, that's all. Well, thanks for getting Mike. I had to take my dad to Northwestern for a test... so I was right there, anyway. - Oh, is he okay? - I think so. It was just a test. Noreen! Are you okay? Yeah. Fuck! What are you doing? I was just... You turned into it. I think you cracked the glass. So do you have everything you need? Yeah, we got everything. We'll pare it down to three applicants after we watch the tapes. - We'll call if you're one, Dave. - Okay, Mark. It's nice to make your acquaintance. - You, too. Take care. - Hey, weatherman! All right. Bye. Fuck! Fuck. David? Hey. - What happened? - I got hit with a Frosty. - Why? - What? Why did you get hit with a Frosty? What is a Frosty? A Frosty is a shake from Wendy's. Why would someone throw a shake at you? - That happens sometimes. - People throw shakes at you? Stuff. People throw stuff at me sometimes... - if they don't like me, or something. - They don't know you. - If they don't like me, or something. - They don't know you. From TV. But you just read the weather. Well, I predict it. You don't have a degree in meteorology. I make suppositions, or I... What are you doing? - I walked over. - You walked? It's freezing. I have lymphoma, David. What? I have lymphoma. - Doctor Pritch called. - What? I was having tremors. That's the reason that I went in. Pritch read my scans. - What's the prognosis? - Well, it's not good. We'll talk about it this week. I wanted to tell you. Yeah. I'll call you after I've talked to Pritch again. I'll drive you home. I like the fresh air. - Well, I'll walk back with you. - No, that's okay. Okay. Every couple months, someone throws something at me... a shake, a burrito once. Why? My name, partly, I guess. I changed it for professional reasons. My first station manager suggested it. He said it sounded refreshing and that they wanted that quality. That may be true, but it's also annoying. I know that. What kind of name is Spritz? It's a bullshit name. It's a TV name. He's bullshit. Well, I like him. He's handsome. He's an asshole. I don't like his face. His asshole face. The other thing, my job is very easy. Two hours a day, basically reading prompts. I make 240,000 a year... plus appearances... which are, you know, not comfortable for me... but lucrative. ""Four score and seven years ago... ""our fathers brought forth, on this continent... "" Also, it makes other things easy, being on TV. Everything's easy. Yeah! I receive a large reward for pretty much zero effort and contribution. The shakes and stuff are a reaction to that, I think. What must you think of me? Your family-leaver. Your non-meteorologist, yet weatherman... frosty-taking, fuck-happy son. Don't die yet, Robert. Give me time to get it together. Give me a little while. Let me get the Hello America job. I can get it together. Two for High Water. - I got mine, Don. - No, it's cool. I got it. Thanks. Tricia's a bitch. She's a little cunt. I hate that little cunt. I'd like to burn her. Hi. Hi. Today's the company party. I thought I'd take the kids. Oh. Well, Mike is out. - Shelly's home? - She's walking Jackson. - Where do you want to take them? - The rink. WCH. Hey. Hey. What? Dave. Hey, Tim. - I didn't know you were coming. - I always come to these... when I can. I have some time this week if you want to go back up to Bolingbrook. - What's in Bolingbrook? - Sportsman's. The archery range. - Okay. - Okay? You wanna go? Okay, I remember it. Well, do you wanna go back up? Sometimes. What's gonna happen? What? What are we gonna do here? Great stuff. Ladies and gentlemen, on your marks! Let's go team Spritz! Get set! Go! Go! Go! Go! - Just keep up, Shell. Come on. - I'm trying to. We should finish. We're last. We're way last. There's a lesson here. Let's finish. I'm hurt. Hon, you can do it. You can finish. Okay? I don't want you to quit. It's gonna mean a lot to Dad. Okay? All right. Let's go. That's my girl. That's it. Good. I'm proud of you. Okay? Yay! That was great! Hon. Hon, you okay? You shouldn't have made me finish! That was like yards you made me go. I'm not a football-jocker. What happened? Just... We got tangled up in a sack. - What happened? - She tore her ACL. These fucking crutches are too long! - What did you say? - Shelly! - Well, what were you doing? - It was a picnic. - And she tore something? - ACL. MCL. Which? Both. - Dave! - Well, we didn't go bungee jumping! It was a fucking potato-sack race! - That's where she got it. - What? ""Fucking"" this. ""Fucking"" that. No, I never said that around her. You don't know you have, Dave, because you don't pay attention! Fuck that. What? - Just fuck that, Noreen. You know... - Dave. - What? - Step back. - Step back? - Step back. What are you talking about, Russ? - Russ... - Step back right now. - Fuck you, right now. - Fuck you, Spritz. Fuck you, fat asshole! Dildo! David, what are you doing? I'm talking to my wife! I'm talking to Noreen... and this clown, whose business this isn't. You call me a dildo, it is my business, Spritz. You are a dildo, pork-fuck. You porker! Stop, Son. Would you? Why don't you go? Why are you here? Are you okay? I came to talk to Noreen. Dave, come on. I will talk to you later. - Dave, what's going on, Son? - It's nothing. Just... Why are you here, anyway? I came to talk to Noreen about an issue concerning Shelly. Well, you can talk to me. I'm her parent, too. So? What? Shelly dresses in clothing not appropriate for her... clinging stuff. All kids wear... Dad, it's a different generation. They call her camel toe. - What? - Are you aware of that? What? That her colleagues call her camel toe. What are you talking about? It means the crease in her vagina... that they can discern through her clothing. - What? - Camel toe. Yeah, I heard you. I mean, how do you know they do that? I heard it. I picked Shelly up on Wednesday, heard taunting, the older boys calling it. - You might have heard wrong. - No, I heard camel... Okay, okay, look. I'll deal. I want to get her through this ACL thing. I'm gonna take her shooting. I'm gonna reapply her there. I'm gonna get her talking to me. I'm gonna get to her... and I'm gonna work it out. A camel toe is pretty much what Robert said it was. It's basically just when you can make out more than you should. But it's the kind of thing... She's 12, you know? If you're around and paying attention, you catch it... then name-calling doesn't start, and maybe smoking doesn't start. And maybe she can just stay a happy kid for a couple more years. She shouldn't be unhappy. Fuck. What did she ever do to anybody? Shelly. - Hello. - Hey. Hey. Listen. Noreen, I was thinking... this pushing and pulling... the tug-of-war we do sometimes... it's not good for the kids. It's not. Noreen, let's see somebody. Work it out. Let's... - Fuck! - Asshole! Are you okay? - I got hit with a pop! - What? A fucking... A Big Gulp. - Man. - Are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. So... what I was saying... See somebody? We're going to begin with some trust-building exercises. The Buddy Drop. Up on your feet. Let's go. Dave, Noreen. Center circle. Okay. Now, Noreen, you're just gonna let yourself go... and Dave is gonna catch you. - Just go back? - Yeah. Cross your arms up front. - Now? - Whenever you're ready. Okay. Good. Very good. All right, Teresa, Mark. You're up. Okay. Now I want you to name something... that you did that affected your partner... and that you're not proud of. I had this thing with porno on the computer, sort of. I got a little preoccupied... Actually, I want you to write it down, not say it. Okay. I want you to put it on the paper that you got for a reason. Okay. Now make sure it's something the other person doesn't know about... that they don't know. All right. Then you are going to give it to the other person... and the other person is never going to look at it. Ever. That's trust. What's up? I thought Dave's science-fiction novel, or whatever it was... was stupid and sucked... and was a waste of time. It was embarrassing. Four years? Well, I thought that went pretty well. Yeah. It wasn't science fiction, just so you know. - What? - It wasn't science fiction. - What are you talking about? - Did you even read it? No. One of the side characters was a scientist... - but that's not even important... - God damn it, Dave. God damn it! What? I'm just asking, did you ever even read it? It was hard to read. It was poorly written. You're an asshole. God. You are a champion asshole. You're a real blue-ribbon fuck! I just wanna make it work, Noreen. I just want to know everything, so I can make it work. That's why I... - I want to try again. - I'm not going back. You fucked it up. I mean, our marriage. What? I want to try again. Fuck you. You know, Dave, you can't even... You looked at it. That's dishonest. It's crappy. - Noreen. - Hey, should I look at yours? That's all right. No. No, no, Noreen... ""Throughout marriage BJs lacked enthusiasm. ""Had difference of opinion over how important that was. ""I thought very. "" You know what, Dave? You want to know why my BJs lacked enthusiasm? I hated you. I hated your hair. I hated your ugly legs, your forearms. I hated kissing your lips, Dave. Okay? And that's why I lacked enthusiasm when your cock was in my mouth. Hey, hon. Shelly, it's cold. Your father said it was going to be degrees today, but... Go ahead. I'll see you later. How did it go? Good. I'll call you tomorrow. Go ahead in. Did you start my novel yet? What's that? Breaking Point. Did you start that? No, I haven't yet, Son. I've been preoccupied. Well, that's good, actually. I want to make some changes, so... I'll give you the new one. What did he say? It's further bad news. The metastatic plane was too wide for radiation. He suggested I see a Dr. Frost in New York for clinical trials. I got a feeler from Hello America. National. They're looking at guys, but they'll be cutting down to three soon. It's a possibility. The salary's great. It's real strong. It would mean moving... but I'd like to move everybody, you know? Renew things with Noreen. We've been seeing somebody. Let the kids start over in New York. Keep them away from some of the bad influences here that... Just get a fresh start. I think that would be great. - That would be terrific. - Yeah. You could rededicate yourselves, knuckle down. What's this? It's a Big Gulp. You should say, ""We might see some snow... ""but it might shift south, miss us. "" I can say it, but I sort of wanna understand it. Why is it? Well, it's Canadian trade winds. Behind all of it? Yeah, this will get pushed by wind out of Canada. - So what's it gonna do? - I don't know. It's a guess. It's wind, man. Blows all over the place. For some reason... I don't know. I went back to Bolingbrook. I bought a three-month lesson plan. Hang on. Before you do that, you know... let's go out here and do a little stretching exercises. You got to rotate your... We warm up... then do basic focus drills, stuff you never think about. Like closing an eye without moving your face... because your face is the anchor point for your hand... that allows you to focus. You have to keep your triangle against a lot of force. We do draws for a half hour, then releases. That's called ""loosing,"" when you release. Great shot! All right! It's hard... but that one good shot leaves you thinking... you might be catching on. Do you lift weights? - What's that? - Do you lift weights? Yeah. - Cardio? - Yeah, you have to do both. Yeah. Are you on any kind of a program? Yeah, our gym coach gave us a program. - That should be good. - Yeah. Yeah. Fuck. Hey. - You know what would be interesting? - What? We should take some pictures. Some shots, like... some now, some in a month or whatever... see if you're making gains. Yeah. I've got my mom's Nikon. - Whip your shirt off. - Whip my shirt off? Yeah. You're shredded. This is great, man. We can compare this shit. That's a Nikon FM? Well, yeah. You know something about cameras? Yeah. I took a class at Parker. A couple more. My dad's gonna get the F3 for me... if I can finish the program and maintain a B average. It's like a 600 camera. I'm psyched about it. I could loan that to you. Yeah? I could loan that shit to you if... you wanted it earlier. Okay. This is gonna go a lot better. Why? Because I got you some bobtail arrows. They're easier. Why? Well, they're thicker at the ends. See? They taper toward the nock. - What's the nock? - The arrow end. - What was I using before? - Chested arrows. That guy didn't know what he was doing. Okay. Fletch it. - What? - Fix your arrow in. That's the term. Arrow makers were called fletchers. That's where the last name came from. Here. There's a little bit of a... It takes a little while. Right there, right below the nock. There! Awesome! Okay, let's loose a few. Let's show our stuff. Aim about a half-foot above. - Okay. - You wait till you're steady. - Are you aligned? - Yeah. Okay. Let it go. Fuck! Come on, Shelly. Get your arrow. We probably didn't home long enough. That's the pause between drawing back and firing. Let's pause a little longer. What? Nothing. - Are you just not interested? - Yeah. Yeah, you're not interested? Or, yeah, you are interested? Yeah, I'm not. Really. What was it you liked? Let's think of it that way. What? What interested you when you thought about archery? When you wanted to do it. I don't know. Going hunting or something. Hunting? Yeah. - For animals? - Yeah. You wanna shoot animals with arrows? - Yeah. - You do? Yeah, to kill them. But that's not archery. That's hunting. That's called bowhunting. That's what you wanted to do? - Bowhunting? - Yeah, I saw it on TV. Well, I don't really wanna kill animals with arrows... so that's not going to happen. We can target shoot, Shelly. - It's not fun. - It's a lot of fun. - You have to apply yourself. - Targets don't move. Well, you know, Shelly... you haven't really hit one yet. You should support me. I do support you. I support. All right, forget it. Take your bracer off. - We're not shooting anymore. - Okay. There's a chance I might be going to New York. A small chance. You think you'd like to come, maybe, if I go? Yeah. We could maybe go with Poppop. - He's got some tests. - Yeah. Hey. Hey, Mike. You don't look real good, Dad. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - What are you doing out here? - Just sitting here. Sometimes I just sit here and look at the house. - You park here sometimes? - Yeah. Sometimes. I just like to see you guys. I see you playing guitar up there. Okay. - Sounds good. - Thanks. - You know, Poppop... - Yeah. .. he's sick. - Mom said. I was thinking about that, too. Why do you have a bow and arrow in there? I was just out with Shelly. I'm not playing favorites. I just think we need to be together for a while. Yeah, that's okay. - How's your program going? - Great. You're gonna get that camera if you keep it up! Look at this house. Someone should be happy here. How did I fuck this up? Seriously. What if I remembered the tartar sauce? Would things be different? Would Robert die not thinking I'm a jerk-off... jerk-fuck? Don't forget the tartar sauce. Just call the order in, Noreen... and quit busting my you-know-what, okay? You always half-listen to what I'm saying to you! I heard you. Tartar sauce. Tartar sauce. Tartar sauce. Tartar sauce. Tartar sauce, tartar sauce, tartar sauce, tartar sauce. Man, how I'd like to put my face in there. Right in there. Tartar sauce. My hips are cold. Tartar sauce. That's when you know it's cold. I like eating pussy. Tartar sauce. A lot of guys don't. Well, maybe they do. Maybe that's just black guys. Tartar sauce. What happened to the guy who was trying to go around the world... in a balloon? Did he make it? I should put some espionage... or stolen plutonium in my novel. Tartar sauce. Spice it up. Neil Young. Fuck, it's cold! Neil Young? Why am I thinking about Neil Young? Neil Diamond. Neil. There's not a lot of famous Neils. Is this Wednesday? I wish I had two dicks. I thought the whole family was going to learn Spanish together this year. That never really happened. I haven't had a Spanish omelet in a long time. Here we go. Anything else? No. Where is the tartar sauce? They were out. They apologized. - They were cool about it. - They were out? - They were out. - They were out of tartar sauce? I'm calling them. Fuck, Noreen. It's not about the tartar sauce. It's about you. You don't care! I don't care about tartar sauce! I'm trying to make a living for this family. I've got work things to think about and pressure. Tartar sauce? Fuck, Noreen, are you serious? You are so selfish! I would do anything for you... - Everything you say is right. .. as if we're not happy. - I'm trying to take care of the family. - You come in here, looked in my face... and you lied to me, Dave. Do you think I'm a moron? ""They're out. "" We both just think it's better for the kids. David, sacrifice is... To get anything of value, you have to sacrifice. I know that, Dad. But I think if we continue down this road... it's going to be too detrimental for the kids. It's just too hard. Do you know that the harder thing to do and the right thing to do... are usually the same thing? Nothing that has meaning is easy. Easy doesn't enter into grown-up life. I'm not comfortable with an 18-degree variance. - Why even forecast? - It's a technical art... not a science. People get that. - Let's narrow it down, Tim. - Dave, it's random. We do our best. A day can have that variance. - Dave, phone call. - Tell him to take a message. It's Hello America. Can we shop here? Sure. Where is that? - Bendel. - All right. Dad? You know what? Let's go for a walk. Take a break. You don't like it? No, maybe we'll come back later. We'll just take a break. - So how's everything going? - Good. - How's school? - Good. - Dance school? - Good. You know, when I was in school... I guess the hardest thing was how other kids can be a little mean. Names and stuff. Do you ever get called names? Like what? I don't know, like ""dummy"" if you miss a question... or ""camel toe. "" Yeah. Camel toe. Do you know why? Why what? Why you get called camel toe? Yeah. Why, hon? Because camel toes are tough. They can walk all over the desert and all the hot rocks. I'm tough. That's right. It's because they're tough. You ready to shop again? I think they make car tires out of camel toes. Yeah, I think I heard that. I just think you're more grown-up than that other stuff. I don't think I like it. But that was sort of kid stuff. I like this dress. It's New York style. Let me see. Hey. - You like it? - I like it. Yeah. Do you like it? Yeah, I think I do. Do you feel comfortable in it? Because, you know, that's the thing. Yeah, it's comfy. You look great. You look all grown-up. Okay, change. Let's get some more. Really? Sure, and then we'll go show Poppop some of this stuff. Poppop! Poppop! - Check this out. - That's nice, hon. I know. I got a lot more, too! Dave. - How are you feeling? - I'm all right. Mike got arrested. What? He fucked his drug counselor's car up. They were on their way to a movie. A movie? Mike said he was trying to suck him off. Then Mike chucked a rock through his car's passenger window. What is this sucking and chucking rocks? I mean, what is this? What did the guy say? He said Mike tried to jack his wallet. What is this sucking and chucking and jacking and fucking-up, Son? He's years old! What is this shit? - Where is he? - He's at home. What is this? Fuck. Are you ready for the doctors? Yeah. Got you! You're dead. I think just what he said happened, happened. I think the guy was trying to make a move on him... and Mike got surprised and scared. Hon, will you get me a pop from the pop machine? Can you get your pop later? I'm trying to send Shelly away so she doesn't have to hear this. This guy says that Mike tried to steal his wallet... and that's why they were fighting when the police came. - How is he? - He's scared. I don't know. I can come home. No, stay there and do your Hello America thing. - You act like... - What? Like Mike's in trouble... 'cause I'm interviewing at Hello America. Give me a break! I don't have any money. Russ is helping anyway. - That dildo's what? - He's been a big help, okay? You can stay there. Fine. I'll stay here with camel toe. You just take care of stuff there! You take care of it! Camel toe? What are you talking about? I had to find out how kids taunt Shelly about that... and you're letting her get taunted. You're not paying attention to the way she goes to school! I take care of everything around here. Well, I bought her new stuff. I bought her a bunch of brand new stuff... - and she told me all kinds of stuff, so... - Don't be such a dick. You have her for one weekend. You know what, Noreen? Just... Fuck! Whatever. Let me talk to Mike. He's sleeping, and don't talk to me like that. More dildo, more fucking... Listen, I have to go, Noreen. I'll talk to you soon. Whatever. I thought you were trying to improve matters with Noreen... if not reconcile. I am. What did Frost say? He wants to speak to me in about minutes. It was cold in there. Would you get me a coffee, Dave? So I can warm up. Yeah, Dad. Dildo. Jacking... Hi. Hi. 0.65. Fuck. - Hey. - Hi. Poppop went in? - Yeah. - Great. Yeah. He wanted a coffee. Do you have my wallet? You only had 1. You should carry more money than that. I know. Well, did he say whether any more therapy could... No, he didn't have a different opinion than Pritch. There's too large a plane. It's a no-go. - Well, did he say... - He said months. - Did he say a lot of months? - Well, what's a lot? I don't know, like 12. Well, if he meant 12, he probably would've said a year, Son. I think he meant three or four. Well, you have a big day tomorrow. The Hello America show. Yeah. ...and here comes the grand marshal, Dave Spritzel. Didn't his name used to be Spritz? Yeah, it sure did... but he changed it back to the original Spritzel. Why the change, Ed? Well, when you're national, there's no more up. So he changed it back... like John ""Cougar"" Mellencamp. He's realer now and more authentic. - Who's that with him? - Those are the wife and kids. Didn't they used to have a real fucked-up relationship? Not anymore. That's something else that changed. It seems Hello America with Byrant Gumbel... gave them all a fresh start... and an increase in salary to 980,000 outside promotional fees... which puts Dave well over 1 million a year. - That got his wife's ear, I bet. - You bet. That buys a lot of face time. Now everything's great. - Did he say that? - Yeah, he told me that... Hello, America. What are your hobbies? Writing. Archery. And you don't have a degree in meteorology? General communications. Well, listen. We've seen a lot of your work in Chicago. Okay. We think you're great, refreshing. We love the Spritz Nipper. Great. Why don't we run some blue screen, and we'll do a walk-through on the set? Great. Here's your station. We'll run some screen. Give me a second to set it up. - Hi. - Hi. I'm waiting for Mark. I'm running some screen. - Dave. - Bryant. - Nervous? - No. - Sure? - Yeah. You look just a little bit nervous. It's not nerves. - Other shit. - Yeah. .. mild in the Northwest. As this high-pressure system gives way... we'll see warm temperatures in New Mexico... I know it's not neurosurgery... but green screen is the one part of my job that's not really easy. .. in New York with colder temperatures west to Michigan... You need a sense of where put-ons will come from... and a pretty strong sense of scale. .. there are travel advisories in New Orleans and Atlanta. It's pretty heavy weather... I've gotten real good at it. I thought everything went over pretty well. So we'll let you know in a couple of days. Okay. This is my father, Robert Spritzel, and my daughter. We're a little late for our plane... so we thought we'd leave from here. - Yeah, I'm sorry. We kept you late. - That's cool. - So you've got the numbers? - Yes. There's a built-in with Purina I forgot. 42,000. Okay. - What's a built-in? - It's a compulsory endorsement... if I'm offered the job. - Dog food? - Yeah. Pet products. Dave doesn't own a pet. Well, I have Jackson. Jackson lives with your wife and kids. We'll let you know. - Russ is here. - Okay. - Where's Mike? - Inside. - Dave. - Hi, Russ. He's upstairs. He's still pretty upset about it. - Did he talk about it? - Yeah. - To you? - He's told us what happened. He was with his counselor, Don Boden. I guess he... I don't really know why what happened next happened. He was talking about my son, and I was taking my gloves off. Apparently, they were going to a movie... - What the fuck? - Why are you here? - What are you doing? - Why are you here? - I'm helping Noreen! - Why are you helping? - Dave. - Son. Jesus. Here's something that... if you want your father to think you're not a silly fuck... don't slap a guy across the face with a glove. Because if you do that, that's what he will think... unless you're a nobleman or something in the 19th century... which I'm not. - You can get inside okay, Dad? - Yeah. ""When my back's against the wall, I order a chink call-girl... ""or I box some rounds with Richie... ""the Puerto Rican southpaw at Clancey's gym. ""'But tonight,' Roy thought... ""'once I smuggle this fucking plutonium out... ""'I'm just going to drink some Scotch and hit the sack. ' ""Roy had picked up Oliver at his science lab... ""and there he snagged the vials. ""He stashed them in his computer case... "" My mom discovered an idea known as a living funeral... in a book she read to help her with Robert dying. It's where someone's family and friends gather... like they might at the person's funeral... only when the person's alive, so they can see everybody. - Hey, what's up? - What's up? Hey, what's the Nipper? - What's that? - What's the Nipper this week? I don't know. You don't know yet? Come on, man. What? I just asked you about the Nipper. Monday, okay? That's the... Okay? - What's your problem? - It's February, man. It's cold. Fuck! - Fuck you, then. - Fuck you! Do you know what variance is? You think you could pick out a day... a week ahead and give a realistic... You know? - Did you know that? - Weatherman! God! Fuck! I have kids! I have to go see my kids! You put fucking pie shit on my coat! I have to see my kids with pie on me, man? Go see your kids with shit on you! Hey, calm down, man! I have to see my family! I have to see... - Hello? - Hello? Dave? - What? - It's Mark Dersen from Hello America. Hi, Dave. - Take care. - Okay. Noreen. - Hi. - Hi. Shelly looks nice. We bought that in New York. Yeah, I know. That's why I said it. It's very nice. Noreen, I got offered the show. Hello America with Bryant Gumbel. Well, that's great. - Are you gonna take it? - I'm thinking about it. It's a pretty substantial salary, and you know the venue. It's big. It's a pretty big salary jump, I guess. 1.2 million all in, Noreen. Can we think about that? What? What that kind of change could be like for everybody. Mike, Shelly, you know? If we thought about trying again. Dave, I'm marrying Russ. Accuracy equals focusing on a point. Gravity pulls an inch a yard. You point up. But you have to factor in wind... which is the most difficult part. Noreen. I had to go in anyway. It was time for my speech. And that's what I know about Robert Spritzel. Forbearance, charity, wisdom. There are too few like him. And now Robert's son, David. Good afternoon. Many of you came from long distances... and I know I speak for my mom and Noreen... and my family, Mike and Shelly, when I say thank you. When I think of my dad, I think of Bob Seger's Like a Rock. And then the power went out. Then, when the lights came back on in minutes... everyone had pretty much forgotten that I was talking... and we never finished that part of the thing. So my speech was, ""When I think of my dad... ""I think of Bob Seger's Like a Rock. "" That's all I said at my dad's living funeral... something about Bob Seger. You've reached 272-7638. Please leave a message. Dave, it's Mark Dersen from Hello America. Can you give me a call back? I called a couple of times Friday... and I'm wondering why you haven't called me back. If I need to move down on my list, look, I need to know. Okay? It's not ""Hello, you know, whatever, Orlando. "" Look. I'm still jacked about you, Dave. I just need to hear from you. Give me a call. Your phone's ringing. I know. Why aren't you getting it? It's the Bryant Gumbel thing. So why aren't you getting it? Did you bring that stuff? It's by the door. You should get it. Fuck. It was a McDonald's hot apple pie. They're not kidding. It was hot. The other thing that gets to people... that leads to pies, I guess... are these catch phrases we're required to use... to single the program out. It gets under people's skin. Spritz Nipper. But the whole thing about all of it... all the getting hit with stuff... the whole thing is, who gets hit with a fucking pie, anyway? Did anyone ever throw a pie at Thomas Jefferson? Or Buzz Aldrin? I doubt it. But this is like the ninth time I got... Clowns get hit with pies. - Fuck! - I'm Mike's father! Here's your shit! I saw you buy this at the mall on North Avenue! And I'm telling the cops, too! So you can cut your crap about Mike jacking your wallet! He's just a kid. See! He looks grown, but he's just a kid! You fucking asshole. I mean, I'll bet no one ever threw a pie at, like... Harriet Tubman, the founder of the Underground Railroad. I'll bet you a million fucking dollars. The first time I was struck with something... a chicken breast from Kenny Rogers... I was standing next to a garbage pail. I thought it might've been an accident, that they were throwing it out. The second time, it hit me square on the chin... a soft taco. Then, pop. A falafel. McNuggets. Always fast food. Fast food. Shit people would rather throw out than finish. It's easy. It tastes all right... but it doesn't really provide you any nourishment. I'm fast food. Hey. Hey. - Did you see him? - Yeah. Am I gonna get in trouble? I didn't do anything. You're not in trouble. I took care of it. I got on him. I let him know we're not messing around. I whaled on him. What? I caught him one clean one for sure, on the forehead... and then I fucking whaled on him. Seriously? He's not going to say you stole anything, and you're not in trouble. - What are you eating? - Corn dog. You're a kid, Mike. Fuck. - I'm not a kid. - You are a kid. Don't put yourself in grown-up situations again until you're a grown-up. - Okay. - Okay? Yeah. - Do you want me to get you a corn dog? - What? No. What do you want? Nothing. Weatherman! - Hey. - Hi. - Are you all right? - Yeah. I just wanted you to... What? I was eighteen Didn't have a care Working for peanuts Not a dime to spare But I was lean and solid everywhere Like a rock I don't really get it. Am I following it? It was just a lead up to other things I wanted to say. Here's the part. And I held firm To what I felt was right Like a rock I wanted to talk about that part... about you. That's like you. I was strong as I could be Like a rock I got the job. New York? That's terrific. That's a remarkable income. That's more money than I ever made, that salary. Yeah. That's quite an American accomplishment. Thanks. Are you okay? I can't knuckle down. Noreen's marrying Russ. There's nothing to knuckle down on, so... I can't fucking knuckle down. Your hand. I just saw Mike's counselor. Mike mentioned that you were gonna fix this business up. He's in no trouble? Good job. Your hand okay? It's okay. - You certain? - Don't worry. You always worry about your kids... no matter how old. There's always looking after. I read your book. Fuck. I was going to do some more work on it, then I chucked it. - You chucked it. - Garbage. It's just what I do, David. I've practiced and I've gotten good. Like you and the weather business. But I don't predict it. Nobody does, 'cause it's just wind. It's wind. It blows all over the place! What the fuck? I have to go to work. David. This shit life... we must chuck some things. We must chuck them... in this shit life. There's always looking after. You have time. Thanks. Pretty soon after Robert's living funeral, we had his real one. I'm sorry for your loss. That's a lovely thing to say to me. Where'd you hear that? His friends. I'm glad one of you brought an umbrella. I had a feeling it was going to rain today. You're not going to take my job, are you? No. I'm going to be a cameraman for Monday Night Football. Is that okay? Yeah. That's good. There are a great many of Robert's friends here, even in winter. I think it's because Robert was unusual. I think that's what brought so many of you out. A loving husband and father for years. And a good friend to some of you for longer. I'm sure that's why we appreciated and loved Robert. He was excellent. Selfless. Resolute. I remember once... imagining what my life would be like, what I'd be like. I pictured having all these qualities. Strong, positive qualities... that people could pick up on from across a room. But as time passed... few ever became any qualities I actually had. And all the possibilities I faced, and the sorts of people I could be... all of them got reduced every year to fewer and fewer... until finally they got reduced to one... to who I am. And that's who I am... the weatherman. But first Dave Spritz has the check of our national weather. Dave. Well, thanks, Bryant. Well, it feels like spring if you're in the Northeast. Is it gonna last? Let's take a look. We've got a warm weather system to thank for these high temperatures... Mike, you ready for school? Russ? Let's go, guys. Come on. You're gonna get it! - Bye, Shelly. - Bye, Mom. That's your national weather. I'll be back with your local focus... at the bottom of the hour. - Hey, are you Dave Spritz? - Yeah. - Can I get your autograph? - Sure. So is it going to rain today? Who knows? Hey, Hello America. I've been doing the show for a few months. People don't throw things at me anymore... maybe because I carry a bow around. I don't know. I go back to Chicago weekends... keep it steady with Mike and Shelly... come back, do the weather. So... Forecast? Come on. Another man is with my family. Things didn't work out the way I predicted. Accepting that's not easy... but easy doesn't enter into grown-up life. I'll take this American accomplishment. That's where I live... behind Fire Brigade 47. Okay. But in front of SpongeBob. Hello, America."
74,2005,Man of the House,American,"At the beginning of the film, two lonesome Texas Rangers, Roland Sharp (Tommy Lee Jones) and Maggie Swanson (Liz Vassey), are going to a church in order to question Percy Stevens (Cedric the Entertainer) about the whereabouts of his former prison roommate, Morgan Ball, who they want to testify against organized crime boss John Cortland. Percy is indignant, telling Sharp and Swanson that he is a ""man of God"" and has not spoken with Ball in years. However, Percy's cellphone rings, displaying Ball's name.
Sharp and Swanson track down Ball to the warehouse, where Ball gives Sharp a key in an attempt to buy him off. Instead, Sharp takes the key and forces Ball outside, where FBI agent Eddie Zane (Brian Van Holt) is waiting. As they talk, a sniper begins shooting, wounding Swanson and giving Ball a chance to escape. It is revealed the sniper is after Ball, and a group of cheerleaders from the University of Texas at Austin witness his murder. Agent Zane is found shot in the arm next to Ball's body and claims he didn't see the sniper.
Anne (Christina Milian), Teresa (Paula Garcés), Evie (Monica Keena), Heather (Vanessa Ferlito) and Barb (Kelli Garner) are taken to the police station, where they all have conflicting descriptions of the shooter. Sharp is given the task of protecting the girls at all times, because their fathers are worried about them. The information is relayed to him by the Governor of Texas (Rick Perry).
It is revealed that Sharp is divorced and has a daughter, Emma (Shannon Marie Woodward) who is in high school and doesn't feel as though her father had ever been around. John Cortland is been exonerated from all charges pressed against him due to a lack of evidence. FBI Agent Zane is revealed to be working with Cortland, having killed Ball and shot himself in the arm. Cortland scolds Zane for letting some ""loose ends"" escape, and Zane begins searching for Sharp and the cheerleaders; he also kills the sniper he hired. With Swanson in the hospital recovering from her near-fatal wound, Sharp and two additional rangers must now pick the girls up from school and secure their sorority house. Sharp moves in with the girls and the two young men with him move into the fraternity house across the street, where they end up busting a drug deal.
Sharp sets some ground rules, including no cell phones. He also tells them to ""cover up in his presence"" (referring to the girls' revealing clothes). When they fail to comply, he orders a massive industrial air conditioner, forcing them to dress warmly. Sharp is posing as a cheerleading coach specializing in conditioning, and at a Longhorns football game he tackles an opposing team's mascot when the mascot approaches the girls with a gun, later revealed to be a water gun. Other humorous mishaps occur, but Sharp's relationship with the girls begins to strengthen; Barb even begins to develop a crush on him.
However, Sharp finds himself attracted to Barb's English teacher Molly (Anne Archer) who calls him into her office to complain about Barb's plagiarism. Later he invites her over for dinner, which the girls coach him through using an earpiece and tiny video screen. After they fall asleep, he turns it off and woos Molly himself. He admits to the girls about his last failed marriage and the way he feels about his estranged daughter. This interests Evie, who has a 4.0 GPA and wants to write a paper on Emma. She uses the house's ""emergency phone"" to call her, revealing Sharp's location to Zane, who had contacted Emma.
Sharp takes the girls to a ""spirit rally"", where he is forced to give a speech about cheerleading. He becomes more and more impassioned, proving to the girls he finally ""gets it"". The night is ruined, however, when Sharp realizes in the nick of time that somebody put a bomb under their van, and Teresa (who was convinced that nobody was after them) is almost killed when her seatbelt gets stuck. Sharp saves her, and she admits that maybe someone is trying to kill them.
Evie tells Sharp she contacted Emma, and when Sharp calls his daughter he learns that Zane has her. He tells Sharp to take the key Ball gave him to open a lockbox, both of them unaware the cheerleaders are listening in. The next day Sharp gets the money out of the lockbox and drives to where Zane instructs him. Zane gives Sharp instructions over a cell phone, telling him he will shoot Emma if Sharp disobeys. After Sharp handcuffs himself to the steering wheel, Zane thanks him and tells him he's a ""good parent."" Zane takes off with the money, Sharp's keys and phone, and Emma.
Zane and Emma get on a bus, but as it pulls away Sharp sees Barb in the back. As he wonders what is going on, Heather gets in the car with him and picks his handcuffs. They take off after the bus in a stolen Volkswagen Beetle. On the bus, Teresa pretends to go into labor and Evie demands the bus be stopped. She attempts to steal the bag with the money, but Zane pulls a gun and Evie runs away from the bus. Zane forces all of the other passengers and the driver out, taking over driving the bus himself.
Emma is rescued by the cheerleaders, but Zane attempts to drive to Mexico with the bag to hide. Sharp shoots a wheel, causing the bus to flip over 90 degrees. Zane gets out the bus, his face injured after he hits the bus's ceiling. The Mexico-United States border closes and the border officers draw guns on him, forcing him to surrender. Sharp shoots the gun out of Zane's hand, and handcuffs him with the very same cuffs Heather freed him from earlier. He and Emma are reunited. At the end of the film, Cortland is arrested and taken back to court, Sharp and Molly are married, and Emma and the cheerleaders are part of the wedding.",5.4,tt0331933,"25.000 Says your source got religion while he was in the can. You trust him? No. Sharp, we're going to a church. Thas why I didn't bring a helicopter. Everybody, get your hands up. Now keep them up... ...and say, ""Hey!"" Say, ""Oh!"" All right. Then go ahead. We have learned from the three wise men... The O'Jays... Eddie, Walter, and the other guy... ...that there is a train coming... ...and it is a train of love. Michael rowed his boat ashore. Because he, too, wanted to get off that water and get on the train. Had the ticket. And I, too, want to be on that same train. So I will see everyone next week. Hopefully. Percy Stevens. Whas it been? Three to five years with time off for good behaviour? Sharp, how are you? This is a church, all right? A place thas sacred. And it shall remain untainted. We're looking for an old cellmate of yours, Morgan Ball. You seen him? He's a key witness in one of my cases. Come on, man. I don't hang with that crowd anymore. I am a prophet in a non-profit world. Aren't you worried about him getting away? I'm more worried about him having a heart attack. You want me to call an ambulance for you? Look, man, I don't even know why I'm running in the first place. I'm on God's side now. Give us the phone, Percy. Man, why are you all treating me like I'm some little punk kid? Besides, the Lord says: ""He who is without sin cast the first stone."" What the hell is wrong with you? It slipped. Where's the damn phone at? Holy cow! Is a musical cow. Look at it. Is a miracle. Like the parting of the Red Sea. Or the time I saw Mike Tyson's face in a taco. What is he doing? No. I know he's not about to do that. Come on, man. He gonna really put his hand up that cow? You can't do that. Is against the cow's rights, man. Whas up with the... All the way... In the hand... Is for you. Hello. Hey, Morgan. Calm down, man. All units, stand by for the whereabouts of our friend Morgan Ball. They're coming in. Texas Rangers looking for Morgan Ball! Sure hope we don't have the wrong house! Go to hell! Morgan, don't run. Eddie Zane, FBI. How the hell did that fire start? I don't know. We heard some shots. Who's in there? Sharp and Swanson. Christ. You know whas in those barrels, right? One wrong shot and we could all go. Look, Ball, you have three choices: You could stay in this hellhole and burn to death. You can come with us and testify against John Cortland. A and B suck. What about C? C is my personal favourite. Take it easy. I'm sure there's a way we can work out this whole thing. Seems like is pretty well worked out to me. I got money. Lots of money. If you get me out of here, I'll make you both rich. Look, see this key? Is yours. Thank you. I'll put that in evidence. Look, I can't testify. Cortland will kill me. Is a death sentence. Les go outside and talk it over. You gotta be kidding me. Nice job, Sharp. Whas that they say? ""Texas Rangers always get their man""? Thas the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. You both have funny hats and funny boots. Who can tell you apart? Long time, Eddie. More than five years. Margaret Swanson, Eddie Zane. He's with the Federal Bureau of Idiots. I'd have become a Ranger if they said my partner would look like you. If you were a Ranger, you'd have caught this bastard by yourself. Thas the beautiful thing about working for the federal government. Other people do your grunt work for you. How's your daughter doing? Real good. Excuse me, I'm bleeding here. Get down! You're gonna be okay. Just hang in there. EMT is on the way. Oh, my God, you guys. It is so hot out there. I'm so hot, I think I'm sweaty. Oh, God. I need to get some air. Oh, my God. You guys, come here. What? Just come here. Guys, come here. I think this guy got mugged or something. What? Where? Should we call the cops? No. I think this guy's coming to help him. Once again, put it together... ...for the lovely ladies of your Texas Longhorn cheer squad. What the hell happened? I heard a shot. I turned the corner, I got clipped. Did you get a good look at him? No. Hello. You okay? I'm fine. I ordered for you. Good. Medium rare, right? Yeah. How's school? You know. The usual. How's your mum? I wouldn't really know. She and Keith took up scuba diving. Anyway, she was cleaning the house and she wanted you to have these. This is a beautiful picture of you and your mum there in little bathing suits. Oh, there's that donkey. I keep looking for a picture of you and me, but I guess I was always taking the pictures. No, you were just never there. Or that. So, I'm applying to a few colleges. Rice, SMU and... Sharp. Yeah, I'm on my way. Look, I've got to... Go. I get it. Sorry. I'm fine. Looks like you've been busy. Yes, sir. Hell, ain't it? Yes, sir. They said you had some witnesses. Yeah, they came waltzing in here about a half hour ago. Said they saw the whole thing. Anybody else know about this? No. Can we keep it that way? I'm tired of being shot at. You bet. Who are your witnesses? Cheerleaders. You know, I think we could be on the news. I'm not talking local. I'm thinking maybe Katie Couric or Oprah. We shouldn't have come here. I need to get to the library. Now I'll never get my psych paper done. I'll just keep seeing his head explode. Evie, remember what we said? You got to breathe. Let air in, and now let that air out, okay? I totally have a double chin. I don't trust cops. We shouldn't say anything till our lawyers get here. We don't need lawyers. We didn't do anything. Relax, everybody. We just came here to tell them what we saw. Do we have to? Yes. As cheerleaders, we're role models to the community at large. If we don't do the right thing, how can we expect others to? Now I'm gonna throw up. I'm not gonna be staying here all night long. Why don't we just tell these people that we need to reschedule for tomorrow? Well, I can't do morning. I'm having my legs waxed. I have a biochem lab at noon. I'm good between 2:30 and 4:00. Would that work for everybody? Don't work for me. And who are you? Roland Sharp, Texas Ranger. Oh, my God. Do you know Derek Jeter? No, he means the other Texas Rangers. You know, like the Lone Ranger. He had that cool Indian friend. What was his name? Tonto? He was hot. Why don't guys wear loincloths anymore? A Texas Ranger was shot this evening in connection to the murder you witnessed. Anything you remember, no matter how insignificant... ...may be of the utmost importance. Do you want a piece? No, I do not. You don't like gum? No. Chewing gum is the most significant factor in the decline of Western civilization. The decline of what? When people chew gum, nobody can read their expressions. Like with BOTOX. I like an older man who knows what he wants. All right. We should so not get involved in this. Oh, God, here she goes again. She do this a lot? Whenever she gets nervous. She drops, like, pounds around finals. Can anybody describe the perpetrator? ""Perpetrator""? The bad man with the gun. Actually, he was kind of cute. Gross. He was a total skank. On a scale of to 10, I'd give him a 4. No, a ruthless killer's kind of sexy. I give him an 8. Les try to concentrate. How tall was he? Average. Like, 5'10"". No way. 6'2"" at least. I thought he was kind of short. What about his hair? Definitely needs to rethink his cut. I mean the colour of his hair. It was dark. Almost black. I thought it was blond. What? This is bad. Did he have any... ...distinctive facial characteristics? Sideburns? A moustache? There mighve been a moustache. No, definitely not. Was I the only one who saw a goatee? Look at these guys. You guys, wait. Wait. Looks like your ex-boyfriend, Brook Burton. No, he doesn't. Morning, Cap. The Dixie Chicks here... ...looked at 5,759 mug shots last night. Wee. Look at this bad boy. He is yummy! He's kind of a cross between the Unabomber and Mark Wahlberg. I now know the hottie rating of every ex-convict... ...in the western United States. Been up all night, haven't learned a goddamn thing. Please tell me this sweet thing is out on parole. Look at him. He's fine. Girl, good. Oh, my God, you guys, I think this guy is in my poli- Sci class. They all said they could ID that feller if they saw him again. Thas a two-way mirror, girl. People are watching you. I know. What do you think? I don't know what to think. I feel really... ...old. Excuse me, Captain. The Governor's office just called. Good. Thanks for coming, fellas. I'm getting phone calls from some daddies that are worried about their daughters. They have good reason to be concerned, sir. If Cortland finds out there are witnesses, he'll come after them sure as hell. Gentlemen, I told those guys we'd take care of their daughters. Stay with them. Yes, sir. Good luck, Roland. Is the taller blond Anne or Barb? I can't remember their names. HE-BAT. ""He"" what? HE-BAT. Is a mnemonic device, son. Heather, Evie, Barbara, Anne, Teresa. HE-BAT. This is a plainclothes operation. Take your hat off. Conceal your badge. Try to look normal. Yes, sir. And I just want to say thank you for taking me along on this one, sir. Thas the third time today you've thanked me... ...and I can honestly say at this point I feel the full brunt of your gratitude. Thank you again, sir. Get in the damn van. You, move over. You think you could turn some music on or something? Turn the motor off. Problem, sir? We don't have a secure cabin. This vehicle will not move until all these ladies buckle up. You're kidding, right? One thing you'll learn about me is I do not kid, or jest, or joke, or jape... ...or quip. Looks like we're waiting on you, Teresa. I saw that. I saw that, too. I see everything. Mr. Cortland, do you expect any further charges to be filed against you? Mr. Cortland, how do you feel about the verdict? After failing to produce any evidence... ...the government has dropped all charges against John W. Cortland. Needless to say, my client is pleased with this outcome. What about the murder of a key government witness last night? If you'll excuse us, Mr. Cortland is anxious to get home to his family. No further comment. Are you denying any prior knowledge? Zane. Is me. I still don't have the money Ball stole from me. And the shooter you brought in shot a Ranger. I covered for him. The job got done. Even shot myself in the arm. You're a free man. Yeah, well, here's the thing. You left some witnesses. Hey, pull up over here. Now you listen here. You better start cleaning this mess up. Already on it. I got to shower. Triple-lock all the doors, put magnetic contacts on all the windows. I only want one port of entry. Y'all can put your audio and visual stuff upstairs and downstairs. I want you to check all the crawl spaces, if they got any, for outside access. Put a tap on that telephone and a bunch of Barq's Root Beer in the refrigerator. Where do you want your stuff at, sir? On the couch in the front room, facing the door. Yes, sir. Where do we bed down, sir? With that bunch of scholars over there. Have fun. Ladies, if I might have y'all assemble in the living area. Is my root beer in the refrigerator? Root beer? No, sir. Then why are you still here? Antonio? Baby! Where are you? Is her boyfriend. Is a very co-dependent relationship. Well, at least I have a relationship. What do you have? Nothing. Antonio. Teresa's gonna have to get back to you. You couldn't possibly be talking about my mother because she's allergic to dogs. First rule: No cell phones. What? No pagers, no Palm Pilots and no e-mail. And the telephone downstairs may be used in the event of emergencies only. Give it up. Send us back to the Stone Age, why don't you? You don't understand what serious business this is. In order for us to do our job, we're gonna need your cooperation... ...and that means paying attention to what I say... ...and doing what I ask you to do when I ask you to do it. Furthermore, I'd appreciate it if you'd cover yourselves in our presence. I realise how very proud you are... ...of your tattoos, piercings, and other body modifications. However, my colleagues and I do not need to see these. Are there any questions? I have one. Are you always such a dick? Yes. There will be no guests in the house ever. Nobody may leave the house without an escort. But this is our house. What about classes? I'm in an advanced pre-med program. I have a... 4.0, we know. Okay, guys. If I miss my biochem class, I'm gonna lose my scholarship. There are five of y'all, three of us. You'll have to pare your schedules down to the absolute essentials. I'll skip all my classes for the greater good of the group. Work it out amongst yourselves. What about dates? Barb's got two tonight. Not anymore. Hello! We've got a game on Saturday. Don't even think about telling us we're not going. You're not going. Don't say it. As captain of this squad, I must inform you that to stop us from cheerleading... ...you're gonna have to pry the pom-poms from our cold, dead hands. I'm all clear. Come on, Asst. Cheerleading Coach Sharp, show me your spirit. Where's your happy face? This is my happy face. Well, I think we're gonna have to turn that frown upside down. Now this cannot be how you helped Florida State to the regional finals. Coach Beauregard? Please, Binky. Okay, Binky. I specialise in strength and conditioning... ...and I'm gonna leave the grinning and the smiling up to you. Well, okey-dokey then. Assignment accepted. Time-out... Texas. Gun! A water gun, sir. Please don't hurt me. Is just a joke. Nice hit! Check it out. Howdy, neighbour. I'm Jimmy from next door. Just wanted to come by and welcome you to the building. And, you know, if you need any weed or anything... ...just come bang on my door. Thas good to know, Jimmy. You'll definitely be hearing from us. Cool. hours. HE-BAT is secure. Roger that. We'll see y'all in the morning. I don't sleep. Isn't that your partner? Shouldn't you have gone to the hospital? No. I'm here. Right. But she's been shot. Thas part of the job. You ever kill anyone, Sharp? Cold bastard probably doesn't even care. Her middle name is Ellen. A lot of the fellas weren't happy when the Rangers started recruiting women... ...and I was sure enough one of them. She changed my mind. I also hear everything. ""The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars... ""As daylight doth a lamp... ""her eyes in heaven... ""Would through the airy region stream so bright... ""That birds would sing and think it were not night"" So your assignment is to write a five-page paper... ...due a week from Friday... ...describing the function of the recurrent imagery... ...of light against darkness in Romeo and Juliet. What does it mean? How does it mean it? And is it possible that this play... ...is more than just a teenage romance with a sad ending? Miss Thompson. I want to see you in my office. Now. She'd like to see you. What for? I don't know. Mr. Sharp. Come in. Have a seat. So, I understand you're the new assistant cheerleading coach. Thas right. May I ask what you were doing in my class? Thas the way we do things on our squad. If somebody's in the... Let me be blunt, Mr. Sharp. Barb's cheerleading is interfering with her work. And for the record, you should know I think cheerleading is stupid. I couldn't agree with you more. She downloaded this paper on plant imagery in Macbeth... ...off the Internet. I know, because I wrote it years ago when I was an undergraduate. Must be a hell of a paper. Yes, I thought it was pretty good. But that is not the point. Plagiarism is simply not acceptable. I've given Barb an F on that assignment. If she wants to remain on the squad, or in the school, for that matter... ...her next paper on Romeo and Juliet had better be wholly original. I'll explain your position to Barb... ...and make sure she understands it, explicitly. Well, good. Fine. Okay, whas the big deal? Presidents don't write their speeches. When you're President, you can be as lenient as you want to on plagiarism. But wait. This play has five acts. She can't expect me to read the whole thing. Is all written in ye olde weird English anyway. Hey, Barb. Hi, Scoot. Besides, people think being a cheerleader is this nonstop party and everything... ...but, you know, they're so wrong. Hey, Barb. Hi, Chase. Aside from all my games and my practices... ...they still expect me to maintain this 2.0 average, and I can't do that. You need to manage your time better. Time? What time? I don't have any time. Hey, Barb. Hi, Tim. Tom. Shoot! Sorry. Tom. I really liked him, too. You got some admirers on this campus, don't you? Don't be jealous. They're just silly boys. We can stop this charade and run away together. You got a paper to write. I know. But if I write it myself, ill just be stupid. You don't know that because you haven't tried. Cheating is a hell of a lot worse than being stupid. Plagiarism is an academic crime. It is punishable by academic death. What do you care anyway? I wanna see you stay alive, academically, physically, and every other way. You like me, don't you? No. Guys, stand by one moment. Sergeant, your pizza's here. Roger that. Set the pizza on the porch... ...take two steps back, and place your hands behind your head. Whas the problem, dude? If that pizza's hot, there won't be any problem. All right, what do I owe you? 13.75. Hey, do you live here with all these girls? Temporarily. Dude, you're my new hero. Imagine what that means to me. Thank you. You're welcome. Without my phone, I am nothing, I am worthless. I need to speak to my Antonio... What is that? The Carnivore. Pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham, and olive loaf, all together in one savoury pie. With jalapeños. Want some? Yes. No. Extra-thick crust. I can't. I'm on the Zone. What zone? The proper combination of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. This combination's proper as hell. I'm a total Atkins girl. I do Weight Watchers. You'll probably blow all your daily points with just one bite. This baby has one point and one point only, and that is tasting good. I don't know why you girls are on a diet. You couldn't weigh any more than... Don't even go there. No, there are some things we just don't discuss. My daughter has a very healthy appetite. Interesting. You never mentioned you had a daughter. Whas her name? Emma. How old is she? Seventeen. Is she a cheerleader? I hope not. Whas her favourite band? You got me. How about her sign? Is she sexually active? Hell, no. She probably is. 68 of high-school students in Texas have had sex... ...by the time they've reached the 12th grade. Slightly higher than the national average. Thank you for ruining my day. I'll tell you one thing about this daughter you know nothing about. She must be supremely messed up in the head from living in a house with you. She lives with her mother. Why did your marriage fall apart? Thas one of many things that you and I will never discuss. You see, you clearly don't know how to speak to women. I know how to speak to women. I clearly choose not to. We need to establish this bathroom at the end of the hall... ...is a 100 masculine bathroom. From this moment on, it is off-limits to you people and your foolish undergarments. You want an egg-white omelette? Does that mean no yolks? No yolks. No, thanks. Want some kamut flakes? What? Ancient grain. Tastes great with soymilk. Soymilk. Who ate all my kamut flakes? Not me. What am I, the Organisation to End World Hunger? This is my cereal. Why do you girls find it necessary to listen to this constant crap? You don't like vagina music? Do you have to use that word before I've had my coffee and soymilk? Vagina. Whose? What did I tell y'all about wearing clothes? Jog bras are clothes. Thas it. That is it. Just sign right there. Awful big unit for a house this size. I get hot. I hear you. All right. You win, okay? We all agree to put on more clothes. Now, can you please turn the temperature up? Thas a very mature decision and I'm proud of you girls. But we should come to a common understanding... ...the meaning, the definition of the word ""more."" We thought you might say that. Barb! All righty. This is Courtney Ryan, my personal hero. Like Courtney, we feel we should not be penalised for maximising our assets. However, we've all agreed to cover up... ...these areas here... ...and this area right here. Good. But what about these other problem areas? Here... ...here... ...and here. You're killing me. Come here. All right. We'll cave on the first two. But we absolutely must maintain navel visibility. We want to be realistic, not Amish. One inch on either side. Three. Two. Done. These girls are a different kettle of worms. Something just came up. I'll get back to you. I need to speak to your witnesses. Eddie, how's the arm? Les not change the subject. There are no witnesses. Even if there was, I couldn't let you talk to them. You know that. Come on, Captain, we're on the same team here. I think I can help. At least let me talk to Sharp. That was him on the phone, right? Sharp's in the field right now. Right. Your Ranger screwed up my whole case. He blew up that lab and all the evidence in it. Ball is dead and I got shot in the arm, for Chriss sake. I need to speak to those witnesses. So I'm asking you again. Where are they? This ""One Riot, One Ranger"" shit won't fly when I slap a subpoena on your desk. My desk's already a mess. One more piece of paper won't make me no never mind. Circle the wagons if you want. This is a federal case. You learn quick. Five years of college. 13.75, right? Here's 14. Keep the change. How's my favourite pep-squad leader? What? I said, how's my favourite pep-squad leader? Not real peppy. Would somebody turn that music down? Hang on, Cap. Is there any more pizza left? Somebody, please turn that music off! Throw this away. I cannot hear myself think. Okay, as we involuntarily enter into this enforced period of silence... ...can I ask if there's any medication you forgot to take... ...or some I might recommend you should try? Yes. Like take a chill pill. I only need one witness. Get out. Whas up, Cap? Is a subpoena from your buddy Zane. The feds want our witnesses. We're now officially in contempt. Don't worry. If Cortland don't send somebody to kill them soon, I'll do it myself. One other thing. I got this invoice here for an air conditioner. 7,572.44. Can you explain that to me? I'll have to get back to you on that one. Where do you think you're going? To the Cactus Cafe. Asleep at the Wheel's playing. Too many people. You know the rules. Nobody goes out after dark. We're young, we're strong, and we're tired of being cooped up. I haven't had phone sex with my boyfriend in almost a week. I have oats to plow. You got oats to sow, and it ain't gonna happen. Like hell is not. Whas to stop me from walking out that door? The Tontos? I eat men like that for breakfast. And what, you? I'd like to see you try it, Mr. Ranger-man. Come on. Anybody else wanna go see Asleep at the Wheel? You think he needs backup? No. I think he can handle it. Let me guess, Clay. You're looking for Jimmy. Totally. Dude, are you like a psychic or some kind of shit? Some kind of shit. The thing is... Jimmy moved. Where to? Travis County Jailhouse. That ain't good. Okay, a hairdo this phenomenal only happens twice a year. Please. It really needs to be shared with the world. What if we have to go to the bathroom? Go ahead. You're evil, you know that? Face it, girl. You're with me tonight. We didn't ask for this. We just went into the bathroom and saw a guy die. We could've kept quiet, but we didn't. I feel like we're getting punished for it. Sorry, but you're not being punished. Then let us out of here. Even prisoners on death row get a little yard time. How about the mall? Shopping with y'all? I don't think so. What about a movie? Not in the mood. As captain of the cheerleading squad, I demand that you take us someplace... ...where you can protect us and we can have some fun. Look who's skating! Last time I was here, it was Emma's sixth birthday. She loved this place. You don't speak to her much, do you? I don't think Emma wants to talk to me. Every girl wants to talk to her dad. She may act like she doesn't, but she does. Everything I say around her is wrong. I've been wrong since she turned 11, you know. Maybe you're just not asking her the right questions. First of all, never ask, ""So how's school?"" Nope. Dumb question. Is too easy. Our brains just shut off. And don't become her best friend. We have enough friends, thank you. What do you wish you could say to her? That I wish I could see her more... ...and I'm sorry it didn't work out between her mother and me... ...and it wasn't her fault, and stuff like that. If my daddy told me them things, I'd be the happiest girl alive. I haven't seen my dad since he left me nine years ago. I'm sorry that happened to you. You have a daughter and you love her. You should tell her. Yeah, maybe you should take her skating again, because you know what? You're getting pretty good. I am getting the hang of it. All right, we're going to let you go. Show us your funky groove. Come on, boy! All right! Yes, sir! Are you okay? That was bad. Morning, Emma. Mr. Zane? Look at you, you're all grown up. Yeah. Wow, is been a long time. Sure has. What are you doing here? I'm looking for your father. Is a professional matter. You got any idea where I might find him? No. He doesn't really tell me anything. What happened to your arm? Is just one of the hazards of the job. You wouldn't happen to have a number on him, would you? Is he in trouble? No. Is just that I'm working on a case and I need his help. If I need to get ahold of him... I usually call dispatch and they patch me through on a restricted line. I'll give that a try then. Okay. Good to see you again. Bye. Sharp, look here. Remember that John Doe they pulled out of a rest stop last week? Rifle from his trunk matches the bullet they dug out of Swanson. Is this the fella y'all see shoot Morgan Ball? No. The guy who shot Ball seemed a lot nicer. And a lot less dead. It was like Ball knew him or something. Knew him? Yeah. If you're through playing detective, can you get us home so we can rest? Nope. Please? Come on. Load up. Yeah, I like that. Thas where we're gonna kill them. Remind me to take a collection right after that. Thas gonna be a good time to get the money. Well, if it ain't Martin Luther Vandross. Why don't you all take a break. Everybody go ahead, real quick. This man's probably got a lot of sins he needs to confess. Probably may have to exorcise him. Y'all go about your business. Can't you see I'm doing the Lord's business? You know this guy? I mean, that is... He got roughed up. That is pretty bad right there. Is he dead? He way dead. Yeah, I mean, looks like a guy that was in the can with me. Think his name's Jack Carter. He work for Cortland? No. He was more of a freelance artist... ...if you know what I'm saying. Looks like Cortland hired a second shooter. Pull up Jack Carter, see what we got on him. So, you girls are cheerleaders, huh? Y'all recognise me? Is me, Percy. Yeah. Percy ""Pirouette""... Stevens. Class of '89. I was bad. I was a bad man. Y'all think thas funny? I'm good. Okay. All right, you think thas funny? You wait one second. ""Ungawa, Texas got the power... ""I said, yes"" Yeah, that was real fresh, Bobby Brown. Oh, yeah? Yeah, let me tell you something. Now, I may have missed the '90s... ...due to a previous engagement... ...but back in my day, we brought it. Oh, yeah. I'm talking real old school. Not like that little tired crap you trot out to. A- G-G-I-E. Whas that spell? Whas that smell? Ladies. All set? You bet. ""More power, more power more power to the hour... ""More bounce, more bounce more bounce to the ounce"" Boring. ""Hot, now show us what you got"" Now thas old school. Hello? Hi, Emma, is... Psych! You got my machine. You know what to do. Hey, Emma, is your father. Dad. I was just calling to see how you're doing. Is kind of hard to reach me right now. I'm working on a case. You know, like I'm always doing. Just working on a case. Anyway, I'd like to talk to you. So call me. You know how to reach me. If you feel like it. There's no pressure or anything like that. You know. So I guess thas it. Tell her you miss her. Except, I miss you, baby. Can I help you? Teresa had a visit from her little friend. What did I tell you people about visitors? Not that kind of visitor. Her menses. The curse of Eve. The crimson tide. I get it. So, someone has to go shopping. Do you want me to go? Holt, get over here. I'm going out for some air. Attention. Price check on register three, please. Can't make up your mind? Do I need the slim fit, the regular protection or the one with wings? The ones with the wings. Definitely. Cucumber-melon body spray. Vanilla-smoothie bikini cream. Sounds like a busy and painful night for your wife. I'm divorced. These are for the girls. The cheerleaders? You do their shopping for them? You are a curious fella, Mr. Sharp. You gay? No. Girls are all tied up, studying. I volunteered to help out and pick up a few things. Are you sleeping with any or possibly all of these girls? No. Wanna have dinner with me tomorrow night? Negative. Negative? Is not really possible, with work and all. Well, okay, that plane just flew into the side of the mountain. Call off the search, no survivors. Have a pleasant evening. These yours? Yes. You left them on the counter. Thank you. Thank you. I think I made a mistake back there. Didn't want the wings after all? No. In regard to dinner. Is not that I don't want to. Is hard for me to get away with my busy schedule... ...as an assistant cheerleading coach. This whole cheerleading thing must be a really tough racket. You have no idea. Anyway, I was thinking... ...maybe you could come over to the house tomorrow and I'll fix dinner. Okay. 8:00? Yeah, good. By the way, I'm Molly. I'm Roland. You're not on the Zone or counting points or anything like that, are you? No. Is that the North Star? No. I think thas an airplane. You see the way is moving? Thas the North Star. So thas where they've been keeping it. Someday I want to do more than look at the stars. I'm fixing to soar with them. What, you mean, like an astronaut or something? No, not exactly. Not a living one, at least. They got this company out of Beaumont... ...and they will launch your remains right out into outer space. Really? I love shit like that. But how? What they do is they park you... Holt, what the hell are you doing? Contemplating the vastness of the universe, sir. Is supposed to be red. Does this look like red to you? Just shoot her, Sharp. You'd be doing her a favour. Where are Teresa and Anne? I don't know. You're lying. How do you know? You broke eye contact. Is a sign of stress and possible deception. So is picking at your clothes. Stop picking at your clothes. Look me in the eye and tell me where they're at. Teresa and Antonio had a really big fight. She had to blow off some steam, so they went to the Buffalo Billiards. You stay here. Don't be contemplating the universe with anybody. Look, a native approaches. Avoid eye contact. You guys are the cheerleaders, right? The ones with the calendar? Nope. Could have sworn you were June. June kicks ass. Sorry, wrong girl. Well, me and my buddies over there, we go to every game. Have you seen us? Yeah. I thought I recognised you guys. You guys were the ones getting really drunk going, ""woo, woo,"" right? You saw us. No. Your school spirit sucks. I'm captain of the cheer squad. Our school spirit kicks ass. Yeah, and is getting hit on by idiots like you that really sucks. You're a sassy bitch. I like that. Get your hands... Hang on now. Everybody cool off. We've had enough fun tonight. Now I've had enough fun. Was that completely necessary? You could seriously injure a young man by doing that. I should warn you. I know karate. You better know something. Any of the rest of you boys here wanna play the winner? We had the situation under control. Yeah. We were about to go all Buffy on their gringo asses. I brought you a pillow. Is better than the ones you've been using. Buckwheat hulls. Is good for neck support. Thank you. That was cool what you did for the girls. It was cool. Thas one big honking bullet. You fixing to send a monkey up in that thing? That thing is a personnel suppressor deluxe. Personnel suppressor? You mean killing? Can't you just wound them or something? Shoot the gun out of their hand? No, is impossible. You're not really the cheerleading type, are you? For me, is more penance than a passion. Religious ascetics wear a hair shirt, I carry the pom-poms. I don't know. I guess is the duality of man, you know? ""That Jungian thing, sir."" Matthew Modine, Full Metal Jacket. Peace sign on one side of his helmet, ""Born to Kill"" on the other. Is my favourite movie. My favourite movie is The Sound of Music. ""Whas in a name? ""That which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet"" I don't understand any of this. Pretty simple, really. She's a Capulet, he's a Montague. The two families have always hated each other and they always will hate each other. Why couldn't Shakespeare say it like that? He could have. But nobody would be talking about it years later. How do you know so much about Romeo and Juliet? I read the play. Why would you read the play? Molly's coming over for dinner tonight. Who's Molly? Professor McCarthy. You call her Molly? This whole house totally reeks. What is that smell? Five Alarm Chili. Is my specialty. You're putting meat into my lentil pot? He's making dinner for Molly. Who's Molly? Professor McCarthy, Intro to English Lit. I had her last quarter. She's a babe. And this is what you're serving her? Is his specialty. My wife loved my chili. Your wife left your gassy old ass. Whas going on? Sharp's got a date. What are you gonna wear? Clothes. Pants, sport coat. Not that butt-ugly thing. I like that sport coat. I grabbed everything I could find. What comes first, astringent or exfoliating lotion? I don't use that stuff. You've got pores the size of manhole covers. And the ears, the nose. We better do something about all this hair. You can use some bronzer. You need some colour. I don't bronze. You'll bronze, white boy. I have been successfully grooming myself for longer than y'all have been alive. Some things have changed since you were young. We've discovered fire and the wheel. She's right. If you wanna get over, you better listen to us. I'm just having dinner. Not looking like that you won't. Barb, can you do anything with the hair? Shave it all off. Go talk to her. Give me that. Come on. I mean, is never gonna work out between you and Sharp. He's old enough to be your... ...great-great-great-great grandfather. And you have an opportunity to help him. You went to beauty school. I flunked out. I know. But he doesn't know that. ""Natural-looking dramatic highlights... ""that enhance and brighten your natural hair colour."" Yes. No. Okay, les focus on the conversation. How are you gonna get things rolling? I don't know. Is been a long time since I went out on a date. Thas okay. Look, just give us a little preview. I'm her. I come in. Go. Well, I'll start out by saying ""hello."" No, I'll say ""hi."" No, ""hello"" is better. I think. I'll wait and see how I feel at the time. Then I'll probably start out saying... Asking her if she ever... We'll start talking about... I'm in deep shit, ain't I? Who knew you were such a babe? Even if you didn't let us frost your tips. You clean up pretty nice, Sergeant. You're all that and then some. Thank you. Remember, a woman is like a horse. She likes the guy on the saddle to have a tight grip on the reins. Excuse me, a woman is not a horse. Just be yourself. I'm not so sure being himself is going in the right direction. Okay. Just be yourself, but not the you who you really are. Be the you who you would be if you were somebody else. Somebody better. Thas what I mean. Somebody better. Maybe we ought to call this off. Okay. No! Is too late. Okay, just don't be the schizoid Sharp. Be the Sharp who embraces life. Now, don't worry. We'll be with you every step of the way. Sgt. Holt provided us with a spare set of eyes and ears. Can you hear me? Can you hear me now? Out of here! Sorry. Just take these. Get! Hello. Come in. Tell her she looks nice. You look nice. Thank you. So do you. Nifty jacket. Give her the flowers. Girls thought you might like those. No, they were your idea. They're my idea, but the girls thought you might like those. Well, they were right. They're not here, are they? No. Good. That would have been a little awkward. Yes. Real awkward. Take the wine. Take it. I'll just go open this. Where do you keep the corkscrew? Left of the sink, top drawer. Look. Base to Ranger One, we've got a makeup check in the dining room. I repeat, makeup check in the dining room. What does that mean? It means she digs you, man. Now, loosen the hell up. Thank you. Root beer. I gave up alcohol about years ago. Didn't like yourself when you were drinking, huh? Hell, I loved myself when I drank. It was other people that had the problem. He's a dork. Well, why don't I put these in some water. All right, look, you got a laugh. Now go to the table and light the candles. No, thas such a lame move. Candles are a total cliché. What do you know about clichés? You've got a waterbed. I say, light the candle. Is sexy. He might as well pull out the bearskin rug and the disco ball, for God's sake. I need confirmation. Is lighting the candle a cool move or not a cool move? Fine. All in favour of candles? Me. Opposed? Mission Control to Sharp. Light those candles. I don't know. So many of my colleagues just stick it out for the paycheque and the benefits. Or, in my ex-husband's case... ...for the endless supply of fresh, young co-eds. Why would a man want to be with a girl when he can be with a woman? Or in your case, with five girls. What is your story? My work became my mistress. Before I knew it, that was all I had. Willie Nelson. Man after my own heart. You want to dance? So, whas really going on here? Dancing. No, I mean here. What is a man like you doing in this house? Well, is... ...a temporary assignment. And I venture to guess it has nothing to do with cheerleading, does it? Not much, no. Is kind of complicated. You want to go in the living room? Yeah. Gross. What are you gonna do, bag her on the couch? Good night, Barb. Do your homework. I can still see you. You're killing me. Hello? Hi, I'm returning a call from somebody named Evie. Thas me. Is this Emma? Yeah. I'm sorry, do I know you? No. But I know your dad. I got your number from his cell phone. I hope you don't mind, but I'm doing this psych paper... ...and I was wondering if I could ask you some questions. Yeah, okay. Great. I have this Hex Rally tomorrow night... ...but I was wondering if we can get started tonight. Five, six, seven, eight. This is... Terrible, I know. I was gonna say good. I'm proud of you. Is good. What are y'all doing? Getting pumped for Hex Rally. We'll have to nix the Hex Rally. What? No. There's no nixing the Hex. It must go on. You can't stop the Hex, Mr. Ranger-man. Is bigger than all of us. Is that right? If we were doctors, we'd cure cancer. If we were nurses, we'd give people shots. If we were astronauts, we would do other things. But we're not. We're cheerleaders. And we're going to the Hex Rally. You don't respect cheerleading, do you? No. Thas because you still don't get it. Samuel L. Jackson, Sandra Bullock, Cameron Diaz... Calista Flockhart, Madonna and Halle Berry. Not to mention Franklin D. Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush... ...and the governor of our fair state, Rick Perry. All cheerleaders. See, you're a negative person, Sharp. Cheerleading is all about the positive. Our job is to inspire, support and electrify. Any fool can feel good when you're winning. But when you're down points in the fourth quarter... ...thas when you got to ask yourself, ""Who you gonna call?"" I might call Halle Berry. Hey, Longhorns. Are we ready to take AM to the mat? I don't think these guys can hear you. All right, well, now that we've put the hex on those Aggies... I want y'all to raise your flames up high... ...for someone who knows a thing or two about spirit. I am talking about Assistant Cheer Coach Roland Sharp. What am I supposed to do with this? Inspire and electrify. Go! All right. Bring it. This torch right here represents... ...the spirit burning deep within the heart... ...of each and every Longhorn that never can be extinguished. All right. All right, you're all here because... ...you want to see your Longhorns emerge victorious. You want to see them dominate the football field... ...and win the football game. Well, then is up to each and every one of us to help them. We got to raise them up. We got to hoist them high... ...to put them on a platform of positivity. Any fool can feel good when you're winning. But when you're down points in the fourth quarter... ...you got to ask yourself, ""Who you gonna call?"" I tell you who I'm going to call, and thas these ladies right here. They're the most spirited group of young ladies I've ever seen... ...or had a chance to get to know and had the privilege of coming in contact with. Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition! Okay, now can I get a witness? This man has got the spirit. Swear to God, I thought he was gonna start speaking in tongues. What about ""platform of positivity""? I was gonna do a cartwheel, but didn't want to steal the limelight. I think Sharp just made a joke. Is more of a jape or a jest, but still, is progress. Can we go to the party? Negativo, baby. Please. When are you guys gonna get over yourselves? Nobody, I repeat, nobody is trying to kill us. Get out of this van, right now! Les go. Come on. This thing is not working. I'm stuck. Les go! I'm stuck! I can't get out! Get down! Okay, maybe somebody is trying to kill us. How did they, like, find us? They looked for us. What about Emma? She doesn't know where I am. Yes, sir, she does. She called last night on the house phone. She was returning my call. Was that a mistake? Get them upstairs. Come on, les go. Come on, move. Hello? Where you at? I'm at home. Where's your mother? Dad, I told you. She and Keith went to Cancún for a couple of days. You don't have to check up on me. Your friend from the FBI is here. He told me everything. Let me talk to him. He wants to talk to you. Hey, Sharp. How are your witnesses doing? Everyone safe? You're making a big mistake. Good. I was just telling Emma that a desperate guy is trying to cover a crime... ...and if he couldn't get to you, he might come looking for her. Don't worry. I'm here now, and everything's cool. Emma doll, is there any more coffee? Sure, Mr. Zane. Thank you. I'm a dead man, Sharp. I don't care about your witnesses anymore. All I want is the money Ball stole from Cortland. All right, the night you arrested Ball, you took a key from him. Yeah. Good. Here's what you're gonna do. You go to the bank, take the money out of the safe deposit box... ...put the money in a duffle bag, get in your truck... ...and meet me in Eagle Pass near the border at 2:00 p. m. Only you, Sharp. No one else. Put your keys in the bag and get out of the truck with the money. Bag on the ground. Put your weapon in the bag. Put your cell phone in the bag, get back in the truck... ...and handcuff yourself to the steering wheel. Don't try any tricks, Sharp. I will shoot her right here and now. Thanks, Roland. You're a good parent. Please board immediately. This is the last announcement... ...for the bus leaving for Laredo, Nuevo Laredo... What the hell? What are y'all doing here? Barb's got a plan. Barb has a plan? You know what you're doing? I spent a year in juvenile detention for stealing cars. It was an educational experience. How'd y'all get here? Brand-new car. I think I'm having the baby. I can't. Evie, get it together. I know you can do it. Just breathe. Come on. Breathe. Ready? Driver, stop the bus! My friend's having a baby! I did it! I have to get off el autobús! I have to have my baby in America! I've got the bags. Whoa, thas my bag. No, is mine. Is my bag. Hi, Emma. We're friends of your dad's, so just follow me, okay? Look, is my bag, okay? Drop the bag. Is my bag! Drop the bag. You okay? Yeah. Is just like dismounting a stretch pyramid. Off the bus! You ready? One, two. Move it! Come on, Emma. Are you guys serious? I'm a math major. Move it! You, too! Off the bus, now! Come on, you can do it! Jump! You all right? I'm fine. Halt, señor. Eddie, there's doctors, air conditioning and three meals a day back in town. And I need you to testify. You're gonna have to kill me, Sharp. God! Damn. Looking sharp, Sharp. I don't know. Maybe we should do another mask. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I almost forgot. Cute. Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. Damn it. The language! Hello, we're in a church. Look at you. Hey, you guys. Could you excuse us for a second? Sure. Yeah, okay. Don't be nervous. And Sharp, remember, inspire and electrify, okay? See you. Great. I feel like a freak show in this dress. Prettiest freak show I ever saw. Wait till they see you at Vassar. Actually... I was thinking of turning Vassar down and becoming a cheerleader. Dad, that was a joke. A joke. Thas why I'm laughing so hard. I love you, Daddy. I love you, too, baby. Dearly beloved... ...we are gathered here for this most... ...splendiferous and loquacious occasion... ...to join this couple in holy matrimony. Now, Roland... ...do you promise to love this woman, and... ...before you answer, remember that... Percy! Get on with it. Sure, but of course. Well, do you? I do. And, Molly... ...radiant, beautiful Molly. Molly. Good Golly, Miss Molly. Do you promise to love Roland... ...when he is odiferous... ...indifferent, belligerent? I do. You do? I do. Well. By the power vested in me in the state of Texas... I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss your bride. Come on, y'all, les get this party started. Who put this table here?"
75,2010,Toy Story 3,American,"Seventeen-year-old Andy[11] is about to leave for college, and his toys have not been played with for years. He intends to take Woody with him, and puts Buzz Lightyear, Jessie, and the other toys in a trash bag to be stored in the attic. Andy's mother mistakenly takes the bag to the curb for garbage pickup. The toys escape and, believing Andy intended to throw them away, decide to climb into a donation box with Molly's discarded toy, Barbie, bound for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody follows them, but is unable to convince them of the mistake.
Andy's toys are welcomed by the other toys at Sunnyside, and are given a tour by Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (""Lotso""), Big Baby, and Ken. The toys choose to stay, except Woody, who attempts to return to Andy, but is instead found by Bonnie, one of the Sunnyside students. She brings Woody home and plays with him along with her other toys, which are well-treated. Meanwhile, at Sunnyside, a group of toddlers play roughly with Andy's toys. Buzz seeks out Lotso to request to have the toys moved to the older children's room, but Lotso declines. At the same time, Mrs. Potato Head, through an eye she inadvertently left in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for the toys. However, before they can leave, Andy's toys are imprisoned by Lotso's gang, guarded by Buzz, whom Lotso switched to Demo Mode. This caused him to believe he is a real space ranger, therefore turning against the other toys. At Bonnie's house, Woody meets a toy clown named Chuckles, who explains to Woody that he, Lotso, and Big Baby once had a beloved owner named Daisy. When the toys were accidentally left behind by Daisy's family during a trip, they made their way back to her house, where Lotso found that he had been replaced. Lotso lied to Big Baby, saying Daisy had replaced all of them. When they found Sunnyside, Lotso took it over, with Chuckles only getting out because Bonnie took him home after he was broken, and fixed him.
Woody returns to Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy that there is only one way out of the daycare: the trash. Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz promptly allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the tag and says that toys are meant to be discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find themselves on a conveyor belt, leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who straps him to his truck's radiator grill, and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.
In Andy's room, Woody climbs into the box with Andy's college supplies, while the other toys ready themselves for the attic. Woody leaves a note for Andy, who, thinking the note is from his mother, takes the toys to Bonnie's house, and introduces her to them. Bonnie recognizes Woody, who, to Andy's surprise, is at the bottom of the box. Though hesitant at first, Andy passes Woody on to Bonnie, and then plays with her before leaving. Woody and the other toys witness Andy's departure as they begin their new lives with Bonnie. Meanwhile, Barbie, Ken, and Big Baby have made vast improvements to Sunnyside, and maintain contact with Woody and his friends through letters.",8.3,tt0435761,"Money, money, money. Hey! You got a date with justice, one-Eyed Bart. Too bad, Sheriff. I 'm a married man. One-Eyed Betty! I think you dropped something, mister. - Jessie? - Give it up, Bart! You've reached the end of the line! I always wanted to go out with a bang! - Oh, no! - The orphans! Hate to leave early, but our ride is here. It's me or the kiddies, Sheriff. Take your pick. Ride like the wind, Bullseye! Hold him steady! Woody, hurry! No! Glad I could catch the train! Now let's catch some criminals. To infinity and beyond! Reach for the sky. You can't touch me, Sheriff! I brought my attack dog with a built-in force field. Well, I brought my dinosaur who eats force-field dogs. Evil Dr. Pork Chop! That's Mr. Evil Dr. Pork Chop to you. ""Buzz, shoot your laser at my badge."" ""Woody, no. It'll kill you."" ""Just do it!"" ""You're going to jail, Bart."" ""Watch out!"" Mom! No, no, no. Just keep playing. Just pretend I 'm not here. Oh, no, Molly! No, it's okay, Mom. It's a 50-foot baby from outer space. And she's on a rampage. Run for your lives! Buster, get out of there. Does the red light mean it's going? Come on. Say ""Happy birthday"" to Molly. - Happy birthday! - Charming. Happy birthday! - Look how tall you're getting. - Yeah! ""I came as fast as I could. Buzz, behind you!"" ""Got it, Woody.""

Sarge, you got it? Mission accomplished. Hooray! Careful. Careful! All right, guys. We got one shot at this. Everyone ready? We're ready, Woody. Let's do it! Okay, Buzz. Make the call. Target is on approach. Just like we rehearsed it, guys. Hello? Hello? Anyone there? Molly, stay out of my room! I wasn't in your room. Then who was messing with my stuff? It wasn't me. Well, that went well. He held me! He actually held me! This is just sad. Who we kiddin'? The kid 's years old. We ain't ever gettin' played with. Guys, hey, hold up. We need a staff meeting. Everyone! A staff meeting! Not again! Come on. Slink, gather everyone up. We are gathered, Woody. Okay. First off, we all knew operation Playtime was a long shot. More like a misfire. But we've always said this job isn't about getting played with. It's about... Being there for Andy. We know. But we can try again! Right? I 'm callin' it, guys. We're closing up shop. What? Andy's going to college any day now. That was our last shot. We're going into attic mode, folks. Keep your accessories with you at all times. Spare parts, batteries, anything you need for an orderly transition. Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done! Finished! Over the hill! Hey, hey, hey, now. Come on, guys. We all knew this day was coming. Yeah, but now it's here. Look, every toy goes through this. No one wants to see... Hey, Sarge! What are you doing? War's over, folks. Me and the boys are moving on. - Moving on? - You're going AWoL? We done our duty. Andy's grown up. And let's face it, when the trash bags come out, we army guys are the first to go. - Trash bags? - Who said anything about trash bags? It has been an honor serving with you. Good luck, folks. You're gonna need it. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait! - We're getting thrown away? - No. No one's getting thrown away. How do you know? - We're being abandoned! - We'll be fine, Jessie. - So why did Sarge leave? - Should we leave? - I thought we were goin' to the attic. - I hate all this uncertainty! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Wait a minute. Quiet! No one's getting thrown out, okay? We're all still here. I mean, yeah, we've lost friends along the way. - Wheezy and Etch and... - Bo Peep? Yeah. Even Bo. All good toys who've gone on to new owners. But through every yard sale, every spring cleaning, Andy held on to us! He must care about us, or we wouldn't be here. You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in the attic. It'll be safe and warm... - And we'll all be together. - Exactly! There's games up there, and books, and... - The racecar track! - The racecar track. Thank you! - And the old TV. - There you go, the old TV. And those guys from the Christmas decorations box. They're fun, right? Yeah. And someday, if we're lucky, Andy may have kids of his own. And he'll play with us then, right? We'll always be there for him. Come on, guys. Let's get our parts together, get ready, and go out on a high note. I 'd better find my other eye. Where'd you leave it this time? Someplace dark. And dusty. Come on. Let's see how much we're going for on eBay. Don't worry. Andy's gonna take care of us. I guarantee it! You guarantee it, huh? I don't know, Buzz. What else could I say? Well, whatever happens, at least we'll all be together. For infinity and beyond. - Can I have your stereo? - No. - Why not? - 'Cause I 'm taking it with me. - Can I have your computer? - No. - Your video games? - Forget it, Molly. Okay. Andy, let's get to work here. Anything you're not taking to college either goes in the attic, or it's trash. - Mom, I 'm not leaving till Friday. - Come on. It's garbage day. - Mom. - Look, it's simple. Skateboard, college. Little League trophy, probably attic. Apple core, trash. You can do the rest. Why do you still have these toys? Molly, out of my room! Three more days and it's mine! Molly, you're not off the hook either. You have more toys than you know what to do with. Some of them could make other kids really happy. What kids? The children at the daycare. They're always asking for donations. What's daycare? - Mom. - No buts. You choose the toys you want to donate, I 'll drop them off at Sunnyside. Poor Barbie. I get the Corvette. Andy, come on. You need to start making decisions. Like what? Like what are you gonna do with these toys? Should we donate them to Sunnyside? - No. - Maybe sell them online? Mom, no one's gonna want those old toys. They're junk. Fine. You have till Friday. Anything that's not packed for college or in the attic - is getting thrown out. - Whatever you say, Mom. - What's happening? - We're getting thrown out, you idiot. That's what's happening. - You need a hand? - I got it. Here. So, you gonna miss me when I 'm gone? - Lf I say no, do I still get your room? - Nope. Then, yes, I 'll miss you. I can't breathe! - This can't be happening! - Quiet! What's that sound? Andy! That's not trash. That's not trash! Think, think, Woody. Think, think, think. Buster! Come here, boy! Come here! Okay, boy. To the curb! No, Buster! No! Get up. Buster! - We're on the curb! - I knew it would come to this! Pull, everyone! Pull! - It won't rip! - Forget it! It's triple-ply, high-density polyethylene! There's gotta be a way out! Andy doesn't want us. What's the point? Point. Point. Point! Push! Push! I can hear the garbage truck! It's getting closer. Buzz! Jessie! - Andy threw us out. - Like we were garbage. - Junk. He called us junk. - How could he? This doesn't make any sense. I should have seen this coming. It's Emily all over again. - Sarge was right. - Yeah, and Woody was wrong. Wait a minute. Wait, hold on. This is no time to be hysterical. It's the perfect time to be hysterical. - Should we be hysterical? - No! - Yes! - Maybe! But not right now! Fellas, I know what to do. What the heck? - We should 've done this years ago. - Jessie, wait. What about Woody? He's fine, Buzz. Andy's taking him to college. Now we need to go! You're right. Come on. - Buzz? - Woody! What's going on? Don't you know this box is being donated? It's under control, Woody. We have a plan. We're going to daycare! Daycare? What, have you all lost your marbles? Well, didn't you see? Andy threw us away. No, no, no, no. He was putting you in the attic. Attic? So how did we end up on the curb? That was a mistake. Andy's mom thought you were trash. Yeah. After he put us in a trash bag. And called us junk! Yeah, I know. It looks bad. But, guys, you gotta believe me. Sure thing, college boy! Andy's moving on, Woody. It's time we did the same. Okay. Out of the box. Everyone, right now! Come on, Buzz. Give me a hand. We gotta get this thing outta here. Woody, wait. We need to figure out what's best for everyone. Great. Great! It's gonna take us forever to get back here. It's all right, Barbie. You'll be okay. Well, Molly and I have been growing apart for years. It's just... I can't believe she would throw me away! - Welcome to the club, toots. - Okay, everyone, listen up. We can get back to Andy's, but we gotta move fast. We'll hide under the seats till we get back home. Get it through your vinyl noggin, Woody. Andy doesn't want us anymore. He was putting you in the attic! He left us on the curb! - All right, calm down! Both of you! - Okay, fine. Fine. Just wait till you see what daycare's like. - Why? What's it like? - Daycare is a sad, lonely place for washed-up old toys who have no owners. - Quite the charmer, aren't ya? - You'll see. As soon as we get to daycare, you'll be begging to go home. Can anyone see anything? - There's a playground! - Wow! We hit the jackpot, Bullseye! So much for sad and lonely, huh? Okay. Calm down, guys. Let's just keep this in perspective. Perspective? This place is perfect. Woody, it's nice! See? The door has a rainbow on it. - Hey there! - Wow! Haven't seen you in ages. I just wanted to drop these old toys off. Is this Bonnie? Look how big you are. - Say hi, sweetie. - Hi. Hey, how are your kids? Molly and Andy? Not kids anymore. Andy's going to college on Friday. - What? - Can you believe it? - You sure they won't miss these? - No, they never get played with. - You see any kids? - Where is she taking us? - Look! - Wow! What? What is it? No, no, no. What's the matter with you? I can't see! Okay, everyone. Recess. Come on! - So now what do we do? - We go back to Andy's. - Anyone see an exit? - Exit, shmexit. Let's get played with. Careful. These toys might be jealous of new arrivals. - I want to see! - Hey! - Rex! - It's my turn! New toys! Well, howdy! Glad to meet ya. Buzz Lightyear at your service. Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. Thank you. May I? The claw! Well, hello there. I thought I heard new voices. Welcome to Sunnyside, folks. I 'm Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear. But please call me Lotso. Buzz Lightyear.

Mr. Lotso, do toys here get played with every day? All day long. Five days a week. But what happens when the kids grow up? Well, now, I 'll tell ya. When the kids get old, new ones come in. When they get old, new ones replace them. You'll never be outgrown or neglected, never abandoned or forgotten. No owners means no heartbreak. - It's a miracle. - And you wanted us to stay at Andy's. Because we're Andy's toys! So you got donated by this Andy, huh? Well, it's his loss, Sheriff. He can't hurt you no more. - Whoa, whoa, no, no, no... - Now, let's get you all settled in. Ken? Where is that boy? Ken? New toys! Far out! Down in a jiff, Lotso. So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour? Let's show our new friends where they'll be staying.

Folks, if I can share, here at Sunnyside, we've got, well, just about anything a toy could ask for. Spare parts, superglue, and enough fresh batteries to choke a Hungry Hungry Hippo. - Think you're gettin' old? - Wow. Well, stop your worryin'. Our repair spa will keep you stuffed, puffed, and lightly buffed. And this, well, this is where I live. It's Ken's Dream House. It has a disco, it's got a dune buggy. And a whole room just for trying on clothes. You have everything! Everything except someone to share it with. You need anything at all, you just come talk to me. Here we are. Well, thank you, Big Baby. Why don't you come meet our new friends? Poor baby. We were thrown out together, me and him. Abandoned by the same owner. But we don't need owners at Sunnyside. We own ourselves. We're masters of our own fate. We control our own destiny. Watch out for puddles. And here's where you folks'll be stayin'. The Caterpillar Room. - Look at this place. - Wow! Holy moly guacamole. Jackpot, baby. - Whoa, puppy! - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. It's so beautiful! What the... Hey, little guy. How long 's it been since you all got played with? It's been years.

Now, if you'll excuse us, we best be headin' back. Welcome to Sunnyside, folks. - Thank you. - Take care, pinky. - Goodbye, Mr. Lotso. Thank you. - Thank you, buddy boy. - Will I see you again? - I 'll see you tonight in my dreams. Ken, let's get a move on. Barbie, come with me. Live in my dream house. I know it's crazy. I know we just met. Heck, you don't know me from G.I. Joe, but when I look at you, I feel like we were... - Made for each other. ...made for each other. - Yay! - Yes. - Ken? - Coming, Lotso. This is so exciting! Sounds like kids to me. I want to get played with. Why can't time go faster? How many you reckon are out there? They sound so sweet. Look, everyone, it's nice here, I admit. But we need to go home. We can have a whole new life here, Woody. A chance to make kids happy again. - Why don't you stay? - Yeah, Woody. Stay with us. - Come on, Woodster! - You'll get played with. - I can't. No. - Stay here. - You can make a new kid happy. - No, no. Guys, really. No! I have a kid. You have a kid. Andy! And if he wants us at college, or in the attic, well, then, our job is to be there for him. Now, I 'm going home. Anyone who wants to join me is welcome. Come on, Buzz. Buzz? Our mission with Andy is complete, Woody. What? And what's important now is we stay together. We wouldn't even be together if it weren't for Andy! Look under your boot, Buzz. You, too, Jessie. Whose name is written there? Maybe Andy doesn't care about us anymore. Of course he does. He cares about all of you! He was putting you in the attic. I saw. You can't just turn your back on him now! Woody, wake up! It's over! Andy is all grown up! Okay, fine. Perfect. I can't believe how selfish you all are. So this is it? After all we've been through. Bullseye, no. You need to stay. Bullseye, no, I said, ""Stay!"" Look, I don't want you left alone in the attic, okay? Now, stay. Bonnie? I gotta go. Bonnie, you in here? Come on. Come on. Oh, no, no. What... What the heck? Now, that's better. - Bonnie! - Bluebells, cockleshells... There you are. Come on, honey. It's time to go home. No, no, no, no! Reach for the sky! Bluebells, cockleshells. Eenie, miny... You're my favorite deputy. - Bonnie! - Coming! Great. It's gonna be okay, Bullseye. Woody's going to college with Andy. It's what he's always wanted. He's crazy. College is no place for a toy. Toys are for playtime. Speaking of playtime, they're lining up out there! - How many? - There must be dozens. I can hardly wait! Places, everyone! At last! I 'm gonna get played with! - Rex? - Come to papa. 'Here's a snake in my boot. I'd like to join your posse, boys, but first I'm gonna sing a little song. A sheriff! Move over, Mr. Pricklepants. We have a guest. You want some coffee? It's good for you. But don't drink too much, or you'll have to... Be right back! Hey, hello? Hi. Excuse me. Can you tell me where I am? The guy's just asking a question. Well, excuse me. I 'm trying to stay in character. My name's Buttercup. You've met Baron von Shush. Hello, I 'm Trixie. Guys, hey. Guys, look, I don't know where I am. We're either in a café in Paris or a coffee shop in New Jersey. I 'm pretty sure I just came back from the doctor with life-changing news. We do a lot of improv here. Just stay loose, have fun, you'll be fine. - No, no, no, no. I... - Who wants lunch? It has a secret ingredient. Jelly beans. Somebody's poisoned the water hole. Poison? Who would do such a mean thing? The scary witch! Look out! She's using her witch-y powers! ""I know where to hide."" She'll never find us in here. What's wrong? She found us! We need a spaceship to get away from the witch! - You're doing great! - Are you classically-trained? Look, I just need to know how to get out of here! There is no way out. Just kidding. Door's right over there. Well, cowboy, you just jumped right in, didn't ya? I 'm Dolly. - Woody. - Woody? Really? You're gonna stick with that? 'Cause now's your chance to change it, new room and all. That's coming from a doll named Dolly. - Who's the new guy? - Are you a real cowboy? - Well, actually... - 'Course he's not, pea brain. - He don't even have a hat. - I do too have... My hat! - Told ya. - I found a spaceship! Showtime. Quick, get in. Fasten your seat belts. Close your tray tables. Hold on. It might get a little bumpy. Three, two, one, blastoff! You saved us, cowboy. You're our hero. I got a kink in my slink. My tail! Where's my tail? Someone need a hand? - Where's my nose? - Here it is. - Here's your arm. - Give me that. That's mine. Honey, the mustache? I don't recall playtime being quite that strenuous. Andy never played with us like that. We're just gonna have to make the best of it. But these toddlers, they don't know how to play with us. - They're too young! - Yeah, they're sticky. Well, we should be in the Butterfly Room. - With the big kids! - That's right. - Yeah, you said it. - We'll get this straightened out. I 'll go talk to Lotso about moving us to the other room. Blast. Try that one. It's locked! - Same here. - Try the windows. Negatory. It's a Fenster-Schneckler 380. Finest childproof lock in the world. - We're trapped! - Wait. Did anyone notice the transom? Oh, great. How do we get up there? All right, everyone. On three! One, two... - Three! - Whoa! Let go! Go! - He did it! - Yes, sir! Way to go, Buzz! Yeah, you think they had a fun playtime? They might hear you. - Okay, now you start. - I... - Love... - You. See? That time, I said ""love."" Okay, now me first. - Okay, okay, okay. - I... - Love... - You. You see what I mean? It changes every time. You are so smart. Come on, Romeo. We're late. - I 'll wait up for you. - Kisses! All right, place your bets. Come on, everybody. - Come on. Any splits? - Heya. Bring it here. - All right. - Here we go. - Come on, horsey, come on! - Come on, turkey, come on, turkey. - Gobble, gobble, baby. - Come on, horsey. Come on, duck. - All right, that's it. No more bets. - Come on! Right here. Let me have the duck, let me have the duck, let me have the duck! Here is a duck. - I won! - Ah, man! - Well, Stretch takes the round. - You lost! Okay, minimum bet, five Monopoly. - Coyote's wild. - Here, here. - Two greens here. - Changing two double A's. Hey, what do you guys think of the new recruits? Any keepers? Oh, please! Landfill! - Cowgirl? Dinosaur? - Toddler fodder. But that space guy, he could be useful. He ain't the sharpest knife in the place where they keep the knives. Neither are you, Chunk. You got a little keeper yourself, didn't you, Ken? Hey, lay off, Twitch. Barbie's different. Aw, Mr. Softy over here. What do you expect from a girl's toy? I 'm not a girl's toy! I 'm not! Why do you guys keep saying that? All them toys are disposable. We'll be lucky if they last us a week. Well, well. Looky who we have here. Let me go! Take him to the libary. No! Sycamore. Woody, what are you doing? I gotta get outta here. - You're leaving? - But didn't you have fun today? Well, of course I did, more than I 've had in years, but, you see, I belong to someone else. - Who's ""Yid-nuh""? - I believe it's pronounced ""Yid-nay."" Guys, it says ""Andy."" He's my Bonnie. And he's leaving soon. I gotta get home. - Where's home? - Elm Street. Elm. - You guys have a map? - We're on it, cowboy. Trixie? I 'll fire up the computer. Unhand me, you cowards! I demand to talk to Lotso! Zip it, Buck Rogers. You don't talk to Lotso till we say you can... Ken? What's goin' on here? Why is this toy tied up? He got out, Lotso. ""Got out""? No, no, no, no, no. This isn't how we treat our guests. F-A-oh, my Schwarz. There you go. I 'm so sorry. - Lotso, there's been a mistake. - A mistake? The children in the Caterpillar Room are not age-appropriate for me and my friends. We respectfully request a transfer to the Butterfly Room. Well, request granted! - But, Lotso... - Hush now, Kenneth. This toy's shown initiative, leadership. Why, I 'd say we've found ourselves a keeper. Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper! We're calling you up to the big leagues, son. From now on, you'll have anything you want. Excellent. I 'll go get my friends. Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss. Those Caterpillar kids need someone to play with. But my friends don't belong there. None of us do, I agree. Which is why, for the good of our community, we ask the newer toys, the stronger ones, to take on the hardships the rest of us can't bear anymore. Well, I guess that makes sense. But I can't accept. We're a family. We stay together. Family man, huh? I understand. Put him back in the timeout chair. What are ya... Unhand me! Bring in the Bookworm. Here it is. It was filed under ""Lightyear."" Let's see here. ""Accessories. Maintenance."" Here we go. ""Remove screws to access battery compartment."" What are you doing? Stop! Let go of me! ""To return your Buzz Lightyear action figure to its original factory settings..."" No! ""...slide the switch from Play to Demo."" Stop! No! No! No! - What was that? - Sounds like it came from the hall. I 'll see what it was. What do you see? Anything? No, just a dark hallway and... Wait. Wait! I see Andy! - What? - That's impossible. No, no, I really see him. In his room. My other eye! The one I left behind. 'His is so weird. He's packing up. Here comes Buster. Out of the way! Get away! Okay, Andy's out in the hall. He's looking in the attic. Wait, there's Mom. Why is he so upset? Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible! He's looking for us. Andy's looking for us! He's looking for us? So Andy does want us. I knew it! I just knew it! I think he did mean to put us in the attic. Well, then, Woody was telling the truth. - Holy cow! - And you didn't believe him. Hey, you didn't believe him first! Guys, we gotta... We gotta go home! - Lotso! - Hey, there. How y'all doin' this fine evenin'? Thank goodness! Have you seen Buzz? There's been a mistake. We have to go. Go? Why, you just got here. In the nick of time, too. We were runnin' low on volunteers for the little ones. They just love new toys, now, don't they? ""Love""? We've been chewed, kicked, drooled on. Just look at my pocketbook! Well, here's the thing, sweet potato. You ain't leavin' Sunnyside. ""Sweet potato""! Who do you think you're talking to? I have over accessories, and I deserve more respect... That's better. Hey, no one takes my wife's mouth, except me. Give it back, you furry air freshener! Come on, guys. We're goin' home. Whoa there, missy. You're not goin' anywhere. Oh, yeah? And who's gonna stop us? Buzz! You're back! Buzz? Hey! Look out! What are you, nuts? Buzz! Prisoners disabled, Commander Lotso! - Buzz, what are you doing? - Silence, minions of Zurg! You're in the custody of the Galactic Alliance! - ""Zurg""? - ""Galactic Alliance""? Oh, boy. Good work, Lightyear. Now, lock 'em up! Yes, sir! Where do you think you're going? Buzz! We're your friends! Spare me your lies, temptress. Your emperor's defeated, and I 'm immune to your bewitching good looks. Hey, Mongo! Keep your paws off my wife! Hey! Let go of me, you drooling doofus! Not him. I think this potato needs to learn himself some manners. Take him to the box. Hey! Put me down, you moron! Where are you taking me? Bad baby! Bad baby! Ken? What's going on? Barbie! I told you to wait in the Dream House. What are you doing to my friends? Get in there! - Barbie, wait! - Don't touch me. - We're through! - Barbie! I did... And give me my scarf back! Lightyear! Explain our overnight accommodations. Sir, yes, sir! Prisoners sleep in their cells. Any prisoner caught outside their cell spends the night in the box. Roll call at dusk and dawn. Any prisoner misses roll call, spends the night in the box. Prisoners do not speak unless spoken to. Any prisoner talks back, spends the night... In the box! We get it. At ease, soldier. They're neutralized. But remember, they'll say anything to make you doubt yourself. Don't worry, Commander. Any doubt I had got pounded out of me at the academy. Listen up, folks. We got a way of doin' things here at Sunnyside. If you start at the bottom, pay your dues, life here can be a dream come true! But if you break our rules, step outta line, try to check out early, well, you're just hurtin' yourselves. Woody! What did you do to him? You all get a good night's rest. You got a full day of playtime tomorrow. Syca... Who's Velocistar237? That's just a dinosaur toy down the street. That's nothing. Let me just take care of that. - Just a dinosaur. - All right. Sycamore. Okay, enter! Please don't be far. Please, please! Right around the corner? It's right around the corner! I 'm going to college! Look at me! I 'm big toy on campus! Hello! - Hey, I 'll see you at the sock hop. - Okay, Potsie. Hey, listen. If any of you guys ever get to Sunnyside Daycare, you tell 'em Woody made it home. - You came from Sunnyside? - But how'd you escape? Well, it wasn't easy. What do you mean ""escape""? Sunnyside is a place of ruin and despair. Ruled by an evil bear who smells of strawberries. Lotso? The guy may seem plush and huggable on the outside, but inside, he's a monster. But... How do you know that? Chuckles. He'll tell you. Yeah, I knew Lotso. He was a good toy. A friend. Me and him, we had the same kid, Daisy. A was there when Lotso got unwrapped. Daisy loved us all. But Lotso, Lotso was special. 'Hey did everything together. You've never seen a kid and a toy more in love. One day, we took a drive. Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime. After lunch, Daisy fell asleep. She never came back. Lotso wouldn't give up. It took forever, but we finally made it back to Daisy's. But by then, it was too late. Something changed that day inside Lotso. Something snapped. She replaced us. Come on! - No, she only replaced you! - She replaced all of us. Didn't she? She don't love you no more! Now come on! We were lost. Cast off. Unloved. Unwanted. 'Hen we found Sunnyside. But Lotso wasn't my friend anymore. He wasn't anyone's friend. He took over Sunnyside and rigged the whole system. So how'd you get out? I got broke. Bonnie found me, took me home. Other toys, they weren't so lucky. It ain't right what Lotso done. New toys, they don't stand a chance. - But my friends are in there. - You can't go back. Returning now would be suicide! But what about your Andy? Isn't he leaving for college? Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off! Oh, Bullseye. I miss Woody, too. But he ain't ever comin' back. Rise and shine, campers! Commander Lotso, sir! All quiet, nothing to report. Excellent, Lightyear. Come on. We need ya back at Star Command. Wait! What've you done with my husband? Big Baby. Sweetheart! It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand and a couple of Lincoln Logs. I don't think those were Lincoln Logs. You all get ready. You got a play-date with destiny! Hello? You shouldn't have come back, cowboy. 'Hey've cracked down hard since you left. More guards, more patrols. You and your friends ain't ever getting out of here now. I made it out once. You got lucky once. Want my advice? Keep your heads down. You'll survive. Yeah, for how long? I've been here years. 'Hey'll never break me. 'Here's only one way toys leave this place. Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn. Then it's off to the dump. Look, I appreciate your concern, old-timer. But we have a kid waiting for us. Now, we're leaving. If you'd help us, one toy to another, I 'd sure be grateful. Well, if you're gonna get out, first thing you gotta get through's the doors. Locked, every night. Inside and out. Keys are left on a hook in the office. Got it. What else? Lotso has trucks patrolling all night long. Hallway, lobby, playground. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What about the wall? Eight-feet high. Cinder block. No way through it. You go over or under. That's it? Doesn't seem so bad. It's not. Your real problem's the monkey. The monkey's the eye in the sky. He sees everything. Classrooms. Hallways. Even the playground. You can unlock doors, sneak past guards, climb the wall, but if you don't take out that monkey, you ain't going nowhere. You wanna get out of here? Get rid of that monkey! Recess! Come on, kids! Hey, guys. - Woody? - Woody! Woody! - Hey, hey, hey, buddy! - Thank goodness! - You're alive! - 'Course I 'm alive! Hey, my hat! Wait, where's Buzz? Lotso did something to him! He thinks he's a real Space Ranger again. - Oh, no. - Oh, yes. Return of the astro-nut. Woody, we were wrong to leave Andy. I was wrong. Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong. No, no, it's my fault for leaving you guys. From now on, we stick together. But Andy's leavin' for college. College? Hog-tie the mailman! We gotta get you home before Andy leaves tomorrow! Tomorrow? But that means... It means we're busting out of here, tonight. - What? Impossible! - But there's no way out of here! No, there is one way out. One way. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. - Springy dog. - Present. Green guys. - Cowgirl. - Here. Horse. - Piggy bank. - Y o. - Tyrannosaurus. - Here. - Barbie. - Here. Potato Head. Potato Head? Hey! Hey! Tuberous root-man! Wake up! Impossible! Hey! Little late for a stroll, eh, Potato Head? That's Mr. Potato Head to you, smoothie. Well, well, well. You're turning out to be quite the troublemaker, aren't you? What did you think you were gonna do? Waltz right out of here? Yeah, and I would 've got away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling toys! You ascot-wearing pink-noser! You're not a toy! You're an accessory! You're a purse with legs. Take him back to the box. No! No, not the box! I 'm sorry. I didn't mean it! I like ascots. Really. No, no, no! Okay, check. Good work, Lightyear. All right, resume your space-guy-thingy. Yes, sir, well-groomed man! Ken! Ken? What do you want? I can't take it here, Ken. I wanna go to the Butterfly Room. With you! Yeah, well, you should 've thought of that yesterday. I was wrong. I wanna be with you, Ken, I do. In your Dream House. Please take me away from this! Take me away! Darn it, Barbie! Okay, but things are complicated around here. - You gotta do what I say. - I will, Ken! I promise! Wait. I 'll do anything! I 'll change your diapers! Go get the tape! And this is where the magic happens. Look at all your clothes! I can't believe you never brought me up here! - Tennis whites? Mission to Mars! - I know, I know, I know. Check this out! Kung fu fighting. Campus hero with matching sports pennant, huh? Flower power! Oh, Ken! No one appreciates clothes here, Barbie. No one. Ken, would you model a few outfits for me? Just a few? Go get the key. Where is it, where is it? Where's the key? Where's the key? Bingo! Hey! What do you think you're doing? I told you, keep your hands off of my stuff! Make a move, porky! Hey, hey, hey! No fighting! Break it up! - Hey! Hey! - Take that, walnut-brain. No wonder you're extinct. Hey, you can't hit each other. That's my job! Help! Prison riot! Get the tortilla. - Ready? - Ready. Barbie? No more games, Ken! What did Lotso do to Buzz? And how do we switch him back? You can't make me talk. You can't! But I 'd like to see you try. Let's see. Hawaiian surf trunks. Barbie! Those were vintage! It's okay. All right, go ahead, rip 'em, I don't care. They're a dime a dozen. Glitter tux. Who cares? Who cares? Sequins are tacky. Who cares? A Nehru jacket. Barbie! Not the Nehru. This is from what, 1967? The groovy formal collection, yes! - What a shame. - Oh, no, no, no! No! There's an instruction manual! Lotso switched Buzz to Demo mode! Where's that manual? I don't know why this couldn't wait until morning, Ken, but here you go. What's takin' so doggone long? So how do we fix Buzz? What are you looking at, feathers? Hey! Yeah, fly away, you coward. Well, that's just great. Help! Prison riot! - Mayday! Mayday! - Give it up. No one can hear you. - What? - I said, ""No one can hear you."" - What? - He said, ""No one can..."" Shush! Will you be quiet? Woody! You're back! Stop him! Don't let him get out! Star Command! I 've been taken hostage by my own prisoners. Quick! Open his back. There's a switch! Unhand me, Zurg scum! The Galactic Courts will show you no mercy. It's not working. Why is it not working? Where's the manual? Here we go! There should be a little hole under the switch. - Little hole, got it! - ""To reset your Buzz Lightyear, - ""insert paperclip..."" - Rex, use your finger! What? - Okay, now what? - All right, let's see. ""Caution. Do not hold button for more than five seconds."" It's not my fault! - Now what did you do? - I just did what you told me! Amigos! We're all amigos. We gotta switch him back. - Well, how do we do that? - I don't know. That part's in Spanish. We don't have time for this. Come on, El Buzzo. Good luck, cowboy. Here they come. Come on, Buzz! What took you so long? Things got complicated. Where's Potato Head? We haven't seen him. Buzz. Did you fix Buzz? - Sort of. - Behind you. Someone's coming. You would not believe what I 've been through tonight. Darling! Are you okay? I feel fresh. Healthy. It's terrible. You've lost weight. And so tall. You're a sight for detachable eyes. All clear. Come on. Come on. We're almost there. Back up. Back up! Come on. Woody! Come on. We're almost there. Buzz, come here. Give me a lift. Way to go, Buzz. Come on. - Is it safe? - I guess I 'll find out. - Woody? You okay? - Yeah. Come on down. But not all at once. - What did he say? - I think he said, ""All at once."" No. No. No, no, no, no, no! - Geronimo! - Look out! Thanks, Jess. Almost there, guys. Slink, you think you can make it? Well, I might be old, but I still got a spring in my step. - He did it! - All right, Slinkykins. Okay, climb across. You lost, little doggie? Well, well. Look who's back. I'm sorry, cowboy. They broke me. What are y'all doing? Running back to your kid? He don't want you no more. - That's a lie. - Is it? Tell me this, Sheriff. If your kid loves you so much, why is he leaving? You think you're special, cowboy? You're a piece of plastic. You were made to be thrown away. Speak of the devil. Now, we need toys in our Caterpillar Room and you need to avoid that truck. Why don't you come on back, join our family again? This isn't a family! It's a prison! You're a liar and a bully! And I 'd rather rot in this dumpster than join any family of yours! Jessie's right! Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from the threat of force. If that's what you want. Barbie! Wait! Don't do this, Lotso. She's a Barbie doll, Ken. There's a hundred million just like her. Not to me, there's not. Fine. Then why don't you join her! Oh, Ken! Everyone, listen! Sunnyside could be cool and groovy if we treated each other fair. It's Lotso. He's made us into a pyramid, and he put himself on top! Anyone concur with Ken? I didn't throw you away. Your kid did. Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really. Chew on that when you're at the dump. Wait! What about Daisy? I don't know what you're talking about. Daisy? You used to do everything with her? - Yeah? Then she threw us out. - No. - She lost you. - She replaced us! She replaced you. And if you couldn't have her then no one could. You lied to Big Baby and you've been lying ever since. - Where'd you get that? - She loved you, Lotso. She never loved me. As much as any kid ever loved a toy. Mama. What? You want your mommy back? She never loved you. Don't be such a baby! Push 'em in. All of 'em! This is what happens when you dummies try to think. We're all just trash, waiting to be thrown away! That's all a toy is! Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot! No! No! Wait a minute! Big Baby, wait! - He's gone! - Holy cow. Come on. Hurry! For crying out loud! Woody! Oh, boy. Incoming! Come on! Barbie, no! Woody! No! Can you hear me? Is everyone okay? Of course not, you imbecile. We're doomed! Everyone, go to Buzz. Come on. We all here? Slinky? Rex? Against the wall, everybody. Quick! Buzz! They'll never make it! Look out! Buzz! - Anyone see him? - Over here, y'all. I found him. Buzz, you okay? Buzz! Buzz! That wasn't me, was it? Buzz, you're back! You're back, you're back, you're back, you're back! Yes, I 'm back. Where have I been? Beyond infinity, Space Ranger. Woody! So where are we now? In a garbage truck on the way to the dump! Hold on, we're going in! You got all your pieces? The claw! - My babies! - Hey, guys! No! No! No! Hang on! Woody! What do we do? We'll be okay if we stay togeth... - Woody! - Slinky! It's a magnet! Watch out! Don't worry, Slink, we'll get you down. You might wanna take a look at this. Quick! Grab something metal! You heard the guy. It's not working! Help! Help me. I 'm stuck! Help, please! Help! Woody! - Thank you. - Don't thank me yet. Woody! Go, go! Thank you, Sheriff. We're all in this together. Right, guys? Guys? Woody! Down here! - Woody! - Oh, boy. Woody, look. I can see daylight. We're gonna be okay! Hey! I don't think that's daylight. Run! Sheriff! The button! Help me! Come on! Go. Go! Hit the button! Hurry! - Just push it! Push it! - Push it! Where's your kid now, Sheriff? No. No! Lotso! No! Rex! Buzz! What do we do? The claw. You know all that bad stuff I said about Andy's attic? I take it all back. - You're darn tootin'. - You said it. Oh, darling. You were so brave. - You saved our lives. - And we are eternally grateful. My boys! Daddy! Hey! Where's that fur ball Lotso? Yeah. I 'd like to loosen his stitchin'. Forget it, guys. He's not worth it. - Hey! - What you got? I had me one of these when I was a kid. Strawberries. Hey, buddy. You might wanna keep your mouth shut. Come on, Woody. We gotta get you home. - That's right, college boy. - Wait. What about you guys? I mean, maybe the attic's not such a great idea. - We're Andy's toys, Woody. - We'll be there for him, together. - I just hope he hasn't left yet. - Wait a minute! Wait, I 'll check! Andy's still packing. But he's almost done! - He lives halfway across town. - We'll never get there in time! - Come on, Buster. - Is that it, honey? You got everything? Yeah. Just a few more boxes in my room. Okay. Come on. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough! All right. Go. Go, go! Okay. All clear. There you are. - There you go. - Buzz. - This isn't goodbye. - Hey, Woody. Have fun at college. Yeah, but not too much fun. - Woody, take care of Andy. - Yeah. He's a good kid. Tell him to get a haircut. Sure thing. Jessie, you'll be okay in the attic? 'Course I will. Besides, I know about - Buzz's Spanish mode. - My what? Honey, you want some food for the road? I 'll get something on the way. You know where to find us, cowboy. Did you say goodbye to Molly? Mom, we've said goodbye like times. Andy. Mom, it's okay. I know. It's just... I wish I could always be with you. You will be, Mom. Hey, aren't you gonna say goodbye to Buster? Of course I am. Who's a good doggy? Who's a good doggy? I 'm gonna miss you. I 'm gonna miss you. - I 'm gonna miss you. - Don't, Andy. Good boy. He's telling you to go already. Come on. Get the rest of your things. Okay, Buster. Now don't let Molly near my stuff. Hey. Hey, Mom! So, you really think I should donate these? It's up to you, honey. Whatever you wanna do. ""Don't go in there! The bakery is haunted!"" ""Are you crazy? You'll wake up all the ghosts."" ""Look out! The ghosts are throwing pies!"" Mom. - Andy? - Hi. Wow. Look at you. Well, I hear you're off to college. Yeah. Right now, actually. So, what can we do for you? I have some toys here. You hear that, Bonnie? So, you're Bonnie? I 'm Andy. Someone told me you're really good with toys. These are mine, but I 'm going away now, so I need someone really special to play with them. This is Jessie, the roughest, toughest cowgirl in the whole West. She loves critters, but none more than her best pal, Bullseye. Here. This is Rex, the meanest, most terrifying dinosaur who ever lived! The Potato Heads. Mr. And Mrs. You gotta keep 'em together, 'cause they're madly in love. Now Slinky here is as loyal as any dog you could want. And Hamm, he'll keep your money safe, but he's also one of the most dastardly villains of all time, evil Dr. Pork Chop. These little dudes are from a strange alien world. Pizza Planet. And this is Buzz Lightyear, the coolest toy ever! Look, he can fly and shoot lasers! He's sworn to protect the galaxy from the evil Emperor Zurg. To infinity and beyond! Now, you gotta promise to take good care of these guys. They mean a lot to me. My cowboy! Woody? What's he doing in there? - ""There's a snake in my boot."" - Wha? There's a snake in my boot. Now, Woody, he's been my pal for as long as I can remember. He's brave, like a cowboy should be. And kind. And smart. But the thing that makes Woody special is he'll never give up on you. Ever. He'll be there for you, no matter what. You think you can take care of him for me? Okay then. Oh, no! Dr. Pork Chop's attacking the haunted bakery! The ghosts are getting away. Woody'll stop 'em! Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! And we'll actually need the rocket. They're getting away! Come on, Bullseye! We need to get in the spaceship. The volcano is gonna erupt. Look! They're being attacked by a real dog! You can eat my poisonous scones! Mr. And Mrs. Potato Head are in trouble. Get on, Woody. It's my friend Woody. Buzz, hurry! Get your extra turbo booster. Thanks, guys. Look, Mommy. They're all playing together. Come on. Let's get some lunch. So long, partner. Hey, Buzz. You haven't met Bonnie's toys yet. Hey, come here. You're gonna love them. Buzz, this is Dolly. New toys! Noses. ""So I guess you could say Sunnyside is sunny once again! ""Hope to hear from you soon. We're all super excited about your new home. ""Hugs and kisses to everyone."" That Barbie has some nice handwriting. Buzz, Barbie didn't write this. - Grab the sword! - I got it! - Okay, go for the... - Triple bonus! - Watch out! - We got the cloak of darkness! - Run, run! - My arms are never long enough! I 'll do it! This is it! This is it! - Yes! - We did it! High-five! Hold on. Well, it's official. You guys made the wall. - Look at this! - Golly bob howdy! That's me! We're all up here! Hey, Chuckles, lookin' good. Yeah, she really got your smile. What the... I told you kids! Stay out of my butt! But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? Romeo, o Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Next season, we're doing Cats. Or might I suggest Hamlet? Yeah. Detached wing. Cosmetic damage. Nothing a little duct tape can't fix. I don't know what came over me. Just go with it, Buzz."

The lines are open. 504-555-0199. Call in now. All right, next call. Doctor, I just want you to know how much your support has meant. Oh, it just takes time. I know, and I really appreciate it. You have been a great, great inspiration to our Iisteners, Ray... ...and although you have come a very Iong way... - ...the journey to healing isn't over yet. - Tell her you Iove her. Yeah, well, I'm a changed man, doc. And now that I'm getting out, there's somebody very special... - ...I'm gonna get back in my life. - Oh, and I'm sure you will. I'm sure you will, but it does take time and.... Go get them, Ray-Ray. Hey, Ray, take care now, all right? You too, bro. These are for you. - What am I gonna do with these? - Give them to your kids. Don't be afraid to read one, maybe you'll Iearn something. - Dinosaurs? - Helped pass the time. One in here special for you. ""39 Paths to Self Discovery by Dr. Marjorie."" I've walked down every one of those paths in the Iast seven years, Jimmy. Let me tell you something, Oprah, all roads Iead right back here. - Failure is a self-fulfilling prophecy. - Just platitudes, brother. Easier said than done. We'll see. - Good Iuck, Ray-Ray. - Thanks, man. You know what? It's a whole new world for me. From now on, it's just Ray. Just plain Ray. Let me ask you something, what's a guy fresh out of prison usually do first? Usually something stupid. Not this time, my friend. We'll keep a Iight on for you. Ray-Ray. Come Iook at me, Ray. Look at me, Ray-Ray. You can't ignore me forever. I'm here to help. I don't see anybody else around to help you on the day you get out of prison. Friends forever. Through thick and thin. Come on, Ray, I'll give you a ride to wherever you want. Come on, Ray-Ray. I owe you that much at Ieast. It's Ray. Plain Ray. What happened to the other Ray? - I wanna drive. - What? I wanna drive. I've been inside for seven years. It's what I do. I wanna drive. You wanna drive? If that'll make you happy. - What are you doing? - You're right, Larue. You do owe me one. Give me back my car! This is no way to continue a friendship! Damn. I can't believe I fell for that. See you tomorrow. I'm the inventor of my future. I'm the inventor of my future. I'm the inventor of my future. Hey, Slim. Ray-Ray. It's just Ray. Plain Ray. Nice car. Thanks. A friend Ioaned it to me. - You shouldn't have come here, Ray. - I told you I would. I had to. Okay, then you do me a favor, Ray. You turn around and you Ieave right now. Damn it. I didn't want this to happen. Oh, my God. Sally? Are you who I think you are? Oh, you take my breath away. Seems funny now, you're being so grown up and all, but here. I'm sorry, but I don't know what you expected. Every journey begins with a step. Hey, over here. Sally, sorry to surprise you. I told your mom I was coming. I guess she didn't believe me or something but-- Stop. Come on. How about it? Fresh start? Remember the handshake? You really think a stupid teddy bear... ...and some Iame handshake are going to make things okay? I'm a different man now, a better man. Yeah. Then maybe you should try your fresh start in Alaska. Then I'll do what I've always done, pretend you don't exist. Which one of you is blowing off fireworks? He snuck up behind me and he almost busted my eardrums. ""AII warfare is based on deception,"" buttwipe. Yeah, and ""he will win who knows when to fight and when not to."" - You read The Art of War by Sun Tzu? - Yeah, who hasn't? Listen. You guys need to find a better way to channel your aggression. I found macramé to be strangely comforting. Show's over. Everyone, get to class. You two, come with me. - Thank you, sir. - Sure. Miss Miller? Yes. Thank you, Mr...? Ray Bradstone, Sally's dad. Oh, how do you do? I'm Miss Miller. Sally, it's so nice to finally meet your father. Yeah, me too. I've only met your Iovely wife. I guess you've been busy working? Funny, I just spent the Iast seven years in federal-- Government. Yeah, he does a Iot of work for the federal government. Oh, I see. Mr. Bradstone... - ...do you know about our school trip? - School trip? Sally, I can't believe you haven't told your dad. How come? You know, he's been working a Iot Iately. And it just-- Well, we have a bit of a problem that I think you might be able to help with. The school trip is scheduled for next weekend... - ...and we're short a chaperone. - No, no, no. The New Orleans Museum of Art. The dinosaur exhibit is there. Dinosaurs? I Iove dinosaurs. Well, fantastic. It's settled then. Yeah, I guess it is. - Excuse me. - Of course. Hey. If this is gonna work between us... ...we gotta confront it, tell the truth and Iet it go. No, this isn't going to work between us. What did you expect me to say to her, ""Meet my dad, the criminal""? - I appreciate you not selling me out, but-- - I didn't do that for you. I did it for me. - I don't even know you. - That's why I'm here. To change that. Oh, really? Yeah, what was the Iast thing you said, the ""Iet it go"" part? You might wanna try that, Iike, now. Because if you go on that field trip, I'm not. Your husband hurt you very much, and no one's denying that. But you have to let it go and move on. Remember the three essentials? - Confront it. Be truthful. Let it go. - Confront it. Be truthful. Let it go. Now, sounds like it's time, don't you think? I've already forgotten the car incident and I'm willing to try again. - What do you want? - I want a minute. - I don't have a minute. - This can't be where you're staying. This can't be the digs of the best driver and getaway man in the business. I know how it is when you get out. You need help? I'm here to help. Take this. It's my pleasure. You need to walk away. I respect that you're upset. You got a right to be, my friend. I was just trying to help. You knew the silent alarm was tripped, you walked out the back door. Ray, the cops was on you already. You Ieft me sitting in that car. I still didn't rat you out. That's exactly why I'm here, bro. To try to make things right between us. Honest to God, I am haunted by it. I mean it when I say I owe you one. I know that. I know I owe you. I'm putting the crew back together. It's a bank. So ripe, it's a crime how easy it is. Make you whole again, get you out of this toilet. And all you gotta do is what you do best. Drive. Seven years. Seven years. I Iost my wife, I Iost my kid! You'll change your mind, Ray-Ray. You're one of us. Since we were Iittle kids. Let it go. I'm gonna make things right. Got it? - Dr. Etman, we have your new TV. - Outstanding. Family room, in the back to the right. Thank you. - AII right. - Thank you. Honey, I'll see you Iater-- I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. - I'm.... - Putting in the HD? Come on in. No. I'm Lynne's ex. Wow, okay. Marvin Etman. Doctor. Marvin. Lynne and I are.... - Marvin, could we have a minute, please? - Okay, then. Did you think you could just pretend everything was the same? Come on, Lynne, I've changed. I really have, okay? - I need your help with her, that's all. - I forgot I was Ieaving. I'm holding a staff meeting at 9. - Did I mention I was a doctor? - Yup. AII right. Okay. - You want me to stay? - No, no, no, I'm fine, Marvin. - Thank you. - Okay. AII right. Marvin? Marvin is a wonderful man and Sally adores him. And I'm Sally's father, okay? I'm sorry, Ray, but we have built a really good Iife without you here. I'm a nurse now. I struggled through school as a single mom without you. We did it and that's the way it's gonna stay. That is not fair. I at Ieast deserve a second chance to know my own daughter. Your daughter is not the same Iittle girl you remember. What happened hurt her more deeply than you could understand. I understand how you feel. I really do. Just tell me what I gotta do, you know? I'll earn a second chance, but tell me what I have to do. What do you want me to say, Ray? There's no magic bullet here. Try acting Iike a parent. Prove that you're responsible, reliable. Do you even have a job? I gotta go. I can fix anything on four wheels. - Ever done a Hummer? - You're talking about the car, right? I mean, pretty much, a car's a car, right? They're all the same. How about a Smart car? Is that a real car? What about a hybrid? Like a Smart Hummer? Live fungus is kept in the cooler. And these are bran, Iow-fat, no-fat chocolate chip cookies... ...our garden vegetable burgers, and our tossed organic green salads... ...with a sprout and carrot medley. And that, of course, is our wheatgrass. Any questions? - No meat? - No meat. But you got fungus. Yes, indeed. We move tons of fungus. - Nice juicy steak, no? - No. Cholesterol? Through the roof. Not good. I gotta tell you, meat's been pretty good to me. Maybe you ought to give it a shot. Okay, that's good. High school, good. And for the past seven years, you have been...? Incarcerated. Is that gonna be a problem? It's hard being on the outside, you know? Things are different, stuff just moves so much faster. How are things with your daughter, Ray? Not good. She really doesn't want to have anything to do with me. Maybe she just needs some more time. No. You know, they seem happy. Big house. Lots of stuff. My ex-wife's boyfriend is this rich doctor. I can't compete with that. But you are her father, Ray. Don't ever forget that. Yeah. I haven't. She has. Fire funny to you? Not ha-ha kind, but, Iike, ironic. Everything I had Ieft in the world... ...is in that apartment. Man, that's.... That's rough. It wasn't much. Tell me about the bank. Good to have you back, Ray-Ray. So glad to have you aboard, Mr. Abromowitz. Please. Stanley. Well, it's just you and me, Stanley. - We have our hands full. - As Iong as you're here, could be worse. - I'm sorry? - I mean-- You know what you mean. Thanks, Dad. Eight-fifty-six and six seconds. Very efficient, Simon. You know you're only allowed two bags. I'm aware of the regulations but these are all essential. Meds and specialty diet food. Laptop. iPad and clothes. Hypoallergenic pillow. Okay. That's enough. My head hurts, and we're Iate as it is. So take your things over there. I'll make an exception. Nick? Can you tell me why you haven't Ioaded a single bag? Picture hasn't formed yet. Great. It is good to have you back, Ray-Ray. You know the one thing I really enjoyed about prison, Goldy? What's that? The absence of you. Keep tapping your hands Iike that I'm gonna cut them off. I'm gonna cut off your hands. Why--? What--? What do you--? What? Okay. Even if somebody trips the alarm, cops' response is five to seven minutes. We're out of there in under three, no matter what. In case something happens in those three minutes... ...just press the call button, Iet us know. Goldy, the masks. Condi Rice? Interesting choice. They discontinued Rumsfeld. Let's do this. - You sure you're gonna be okay? - Yes, Mom. It's only one night. It's the first time we've been away from each other Iike this. I'll be fine. You'll be fine. Marvin will be fine. You're gonna have a great time without me. - You have my number if anything happens. - I do as Iong as you haven't changed it. I Iove you. - I Iove you too. - Okay. - Have fun. - I will. - Be safe. - Thanks, Mom. - Trick or treat. Everybody down. - Everybody down. You heard the man. Get on the ground. Not you. Come on. Give it. Come on, genius. AII the money. - Hey. - Hey. Heck, yeah, you're doing great. Don't touch, Daddy. I can do it. I know, I'm not doing anything. You're doing it all by yourself. I know, Daddy. I can drive just Iike you now. Okay. Pull over to the curb. That was awesome. Handshake? Thanks, Daddy. Not again. This is Meredith Sherbourne confirming my 4:00 with Dr. Frankenheimer. I have the address, yes. Thanks. Isn't there, Iike, a recovery period? Not with Dr. Frankenheimer. He did Jessica Simpson, and her Iips were paparazzi-ready in hours. Mr. Choi? This is Ted. The guy who ordered the six boxes of cherry bombs and M-80s. Okay. Yeah. I'll be at your store before you close. Josh, there's a seat back here. Hey, Brenda. Okay if I sit here? - Sure. Might as well. - Thanks. Children, I don't want any inappropriate use of cell phones or iPods. And no gum. Oh, Mr. Bradstone. You still short a chaperone? Yes, we are. Welcome aboard. Come on. Big bucks, no whammies, baby. Get that bag. Come on. Coming up on two and a half minutes. - What the hell are you Iooking at? - I'm sorry. Your mask. Condoleezza Rice, right? What? You think this is funny? You do realize I'm robbing you, right, Iady? You do see the gun, right? You think it's funny, a gun in your face? Like I won't shoot you dead? Like I'm joking around? So you didn't intend it to be funny? Everybody, Iisten up. I would Iike you to meet Sally's father, Mr. Bradstone. He will be joining us. Please, God, take me now. - Oh, won't you sit down? - Thanks. Cops! You said five minutes! They're still a ways off and we've got Ray-Ray behind the wheel. Let's go. Thank you very much. Hey, okay, Iet's go. Let's go. Let's go. - Okay. Go, go, go. Come on. - Go, go, go. Where the hell is Ray-Ray? I'm gonna kill Ray-Ray twice. - He took the keys. Why take the keys? - You serious? Shut up, all right? They didn't see us come out the bank. They don't know we robbed the bank. Just be calm. Stay calm. Run! Del, where the hell are you going? Listen to me. Please, get off this bus now. I'm begging you. I get off this bus, I Iose you forever. Same goes if you stay. Let it go. Oh, dude, you messed up my bags, man. - Hey. - He's got the money. Come on. We gotta go. That money ain't no good to us in jail. - What the hell is he doing? - Larue, we gotta go now. Hey, you probably ought to get moving. Cops are gonna jam us up. No field trip. I Iike to Iet the engine warm up first. I find that a warm engine is a happy engine. It's warm. Go. Now. Officer involved in a 10-20. Possibly 10-20-I. Excuse me. You don't wanna go to work today. - Why not? - Because we have guns. And we need your car. - It's a police emergency. - Commandeering. Except we're not the police. I always wanted to do that. We gotta get that money back. There. Well, Iook who's going on a field trip. Hey, hey, hey. - Come on. The truck. - I see it. The truck! So let me get this straight. He took your Visa, your MasterCard, your American Express.... Get out. You're not supposed to move after a blow. - I just went to a safety seminar. - Come on. Get out of here. Hey. You bruised my coccyx. I don't see the bus. Well, Redwood Junior High School Ioves New Orleans. We're just gonna ask a few questions. - Who would you say was in charge? - I'm not following. It's a simple question. Who was in charge? Bush or Cheney? Not sure. I couldn't keep my eyes off of Condoleezza Rice. It made no sense to me. A man chooses a Condoleezza Rice mask to rob a bank... ...then gets offended when somebody has a perfectly normal reaction to it? At first I thought, ""Hey, I almost don't mind being robbed... ...by a guy in a Condoleezza Rice mask. It shows he has a sense of humor."" I Iike a guy with a sense of humor. Detectives? We found these keys in the bushes. They fit the SUV out front. And we got a print. Let me up. I gotta go talk to my kid. Sally, I know I don't have a place in your heart right now... ...or your mom's. At Ieast not yet. But I was kind of hoping... ...that you could give me a chance to at Ieast show you the real me. This might be my Iast shot at it. What do you say? I don't see you. I don't hear you. You're not even on the bus. Stop the bus. - What? - You heard me. I said, stop the bus. Hand it over. - Don't play dumb. Hand it over. - Look, the shot wasn't meant for you. Collateral damage is an inherent byproduct of any armed conflict. AII due respect to Sun Tzu... ...where I come from... ...you find the guy that did it... ...you tear his heart out. I'm Mr. Bradstone. I'm the chaperone. It is too frigging Ioud in here. And I've got a headache the size of the moon. Mr. Bradstone-- Now, I've got no intentions of traveling with a bunch of screaming misfits. So tone it way down. And don't test me, or it'll get ugly. If you understand English raise your hands. Now shut up. Mr. Bradstone. Could...? Hi. We don't ever tell our children to shut up. Even when they misbehave and act Iike brats. Why not? Do you know the definition of ""Iawsuit""? No matter what these children do... ...they cannot be met with such verbal aggression. Do you hear that? Librarians kill for that kind of quiet. I know. Me too. The problem is that when misbehavior is met with your kind of strictness... ...bad behavior stops immediately... ...but then it begins again and again and again. Okay. Yeah. Your turf. Thank you. Seen his tattoo? It's not the type you get in the mall. It's the type you get in a back alley with a pen, guitar strings and a 9-volt battery. Plus he read The Art of War. Yeah, I know. I thought I was bad. I've only read the CliffNotes. - He's either a narc or a CIA agent. - Or both. He's hot. Old hot, but still. Scary hot. This guy's probably Special Forces or Navy SEALs. My marriage was a disaster. I've been divorced seven years. A day doesn't go by when I don't think of it and get a pain right here. Confront it. Tell the truth. Let it go. You knocked off the first one, work on the other two. I feel something very deeply for Miss Miller. Happy for you. But I need your advice. You're a man of the world. What do I say? I'm so out of practice. AII right, Iisten. You're obviously a big talker, right? The key for you is, Iet her do some talking, all right? And then when she's done talking, inhale deeply... ...hold it. Then respond. Lets her think you're a big Iistener. Breath mint wouldn't hurt either. Came on a Iittle strong, huh? I mean, we're here now, right? So you gotta make the most of the moment. Are you high? When are you gonna understand... ...that every second you're here drives us farther apart? Excuse me, sir. My name is Josh. Listen, I really appreciate what you did back there. I swear I read this page times. Yeah. Yeah, you know, it was pretty Ioud. Yeah. Nice meeting you. Well, I'm glad somebody appreciated it. Just because that print is Ray Bradstone's does not put him back behind bars. It sure as hell puts him at the crime scene. Ray drives. He saw things going bad on the inside and took a walk. Seven years ago, I busted this guy. You know what the joker says to me? ""Thank you. I'm gonna turn my Iife around."" And you know what? I believed him. Del. Hey, Del. Del, can you hear me? There's no school today, Mommy. AII right, Del, we know you hit that bank on Main... ...and your associates, Phillip Larue and Goldy Stentz, stole a car... ...right around the corner from the bank. Why don't you make it easy on yourself and tell us where they are. You saw a shooting star? Focus, Del. Where's the money? Pretty bus. What bus? Pretty signs. Going on a trip for school. School trip? Field trip of some kind? What? Oh, jeez. Yeah? Papers? Redwood Junior High School. Please connect me. Redwood Junior High. Yeah. You have that field trip today, right? Yeah, that's right. Who is this? My niece forgot her-- She Ieft her backpack in my car. She needs it right away. I'm sorry. They're on their way. We sent home agendas for all the students. Perhaps I could contact the teacher in charge of the-- Well, I'm in a bit of a panic here because my niece needs her insulin... ...and she forgot her schedule, and you know how kids are. It's not our policy to give out schedules over the phone, sir. Really? Well, I'm a Iawyer with Stein, Simon and Moxie. And if my Iittle niece doesn't get her insulin... ...she could go into a coma... ...and, you know what, boom, she'd go in a coma and she could die. I'll still need the child's name, sir. It's school policy. - Bradstone. - Bradstone. Oh, Sally, yes. Well, they're scheduled to arrive at the New Orleans Museum of Art at :00... ...then on to a tour of the French Quarter... ...and then on to the Satchmo Music Festival this evening. Hello? Hello? You know, Larue, I've been thinking. So Del ran around one side of the bus with our money... ...and come out the other side without it, then it turns out Ray-Ray's on the bus? I mean, you don't think.... You do think. Ray-Ray. Okay, everybody, Iisten up. There are a few rules that we need adhere to. People. Excuse me. I need your attention, please. People, I am talking. Oh, for the Iove of-- Children. Hey! Listen up! As of this moment, consider yourself under my watch. I expect all rules to be followed. If not, meal rations will be taken away, visitor privileges denied... ...and hard Iabor instituted. I mean, you'll get a detention. Right. So file in, quietly. You're Iearning. Is this a field trip or basic training? It's Iike a bad episode of Nanny 911. And I thought my parents were Iosers. Del Muniz sees a bus here by the school, maybe it's a field trip or something. Ten minutes Iater, the truck guy sees Goldy and Larue driving alongside a bus. - You think it's the same bus? - Maybe. What if our man Ray-Ray is on that bus? I bet you that if we find that bus... ...we're gonna find Ray and a whole Iot of money. - Yeah? - Yeah. I'm so sorry, but there's been a bit of a mix-up. Unfortunately, the docent assigned to your class has called in sick... ...and we don't have anyone else to cover the tour. No tour. - Yeah. - Wait just a minute. You don't have anyone to fill in? I'm sorry, but not at the moment. No problem. I know the perfect person. This is Oviraptor philoceratops. - Anybody know what that means? - No. Sally? No clue. It means ""egg snatcher."" - What was your name? - Simon. Not only is Simon immaculately overdressed... ...he also happens to be correct. Oh, so they stole eggs. Kind of Iike dinosaur robbers. Maybe they should've returned the eggs and gone to dinosaur jail. Maybe. Except that they weren't egg robbers, they were egg protectors. Oviraptors Iived their whole Iives devoted... ...to defending their nests and feeding their young. Well, they sucked at that, didn't they? Since they are now extinct? First of all, you shouldn't say ""suck."" Second of all, they did the best they could. Well, their best wasn't good enough. Was it? Okay then. Moving on. Does anybody know what modern animal is a direct descendant of the Oviraptor? Anyone other than Simon? How about you? I see you trying to hide back there. Come on, give it a shot. I don't know. Lizards? That's a really good guess. I'm gonna give you a hint. They're around us everywhere, crapping on everything. Dogs? So you think that a Tyrannosaurus rex... ...is now being carried around in a Iittle bag by Paris Hilton? - What about cats? - Way off. AIIigators. Snakes? Bears? - Elephants? - Incorrect-o. Chickens. Wait. We have a winner. As funny as that sounds, she's right. It's birds. It's been proven now that birds' ancestors all had fused clavicles... ...and well developed furcula. You're saying birds descended from dinosaurs. Right. That's pretty cool. AII right, who wants to see an Allosaurus? This way. You are doing wonderfully, Mr. B. Sorry. - Hey. - Hey. Your dad's pretty awesome. He's one surprise after another. You should see my beat on the woolly mammoth. Really butter your muffin. Kids, all right. We've seen enough dead animals. How many dinosaurs you're gonna Iook at? Let's just go back to the bus and just move on. Okay. No, no. It's not part of the plan. Everything's gonna be fine. Stanley here is gonna take you all back to the bus. - Just go with Stanley. I gotta take a Ieak. - We have another hour and a half. I know, but Stanley's gonna move you along. Just follow Stanley. Go with Stanley, get to the bus. I'll meet you out there. It's gonna work out. - Really? - It'll be fine. It'll be great. Okay, we'll go back. Don't panic. Everything's fine. This way. It's okay. Come on. Okay, quietly, please. Orderly. Go on. - You hear that? - He Iikes to sing... ...while he goes number two. He'll have to pick up the tempo a bit. We got a fire. Trust me. Unless the fire is under his rear end, he's not moving. - Hey, buddy, you done in there? - Nope. What do you think you're doing? Little man, Daddy's coming in, okay? Just stay here until I put out the fire. Daddy, are the firemen in here? - What are you doing here? - You fed us to the dogs, Ray. I changed my mind, end of story. I'm gonna make things right with my kid and you're not gonna screw it up. I owe you nothing. I think you broke my nose. That's a nice touch, using the kid as a cover, but I don't buy it. You Ieft us to take the hit, to get even, and now you got the money too? How would I have your money? We saw Del doing his Iittle magic trick, getting the money on that bus. I walked away to save my family. Yeah? I tell you to get up? We'll find you, Ray. You can run, but you can't hide. I see either one of you near my daughter, I'm gonna finish this. - Let's go. Everybody on the bus. - No. What's going on? - What happened? - Nothing. Just gotta keep schedule. Let's go. Get on the bus. Listen, we can't go yet because Nick isn't here. This is a fire Iane. The fire department's gonna be here any second. You got his cell phone? Call him. We aren't supposed to Ieave for another hour. I know, but who'd have known? Fire. We gotta go. Come on. Get on the bus. Sometimes you gotta zig, not zag. Go. Call Nick, you tell him to meet us at the hotel. Everything will be fine. AII right, who's ready for some field tripping? We gotta get a cab. Right. I gotta do something about this. Why are you driving so fast? - You're scaring everybody. - Please, Sally. Trust me, okay? I might not be the best parent in the world, I know how to drive. - Sorry. - No problem. Did I not park the bus right here? We are gonna take a tour of the historic French Quarter. At the end of the tour, we're gonna go by St. Louis Cemetery Number 1. That cemetery was established in 1789. And in that cemetery, we're gonna visit the tomb of Marie Laveau... ...the voodoo queen of New Orleans. Supposedly that tomb is the second most visited tomb... ...in the United States. - Larue? - Ray-Ray, you stole my car. You stole my money, okay? You humiliated us in a public bathroom. My patience is wearing thin with you, my friend. Back the hell off, Larue. You give me back my money and I'll back off. I'm Iooking right at you, Ray. Surprise. I swear to God, I'm gonna shoot you in the face in front of your Iittle girl. - Then you know what I'm gonna do--? - No. No. You don't come anywhere near my kid. I've got your money right here. I'll bring it to you. Antoine's, across the street from where you're standing. AII right? I'll come to you. Now you're talking sense, Ray-Ray. I'll be right here, I'll be here waiting. - That's them. - You got them. Ray-Ray, you son of a bitch, you double-crossed me again! You're dead! Children, you have more minutes, then back to the bus. Kellan Smith, right? - Yeah. - He's awesome. Like, nobody here even knows who he is. Well, they say that song is about his father. Well, yeah, stepfather really... - ...but same idea. - Yeah. It's Iike he writes for-- - I don't know. - Outsiders. Exactly, you know. People with brains, not these clones or wannabes. Can't imagine any of Britney's songs being inspired by Kierkegaard. - Although, you never know. - Yeah. I think it's pretty cool your dad came on this field trip. - Really? - Yeah. He's not Iike most parents... ...where they build these invisible walls around them. Oh, no, he's been behind walls. Well, you can tell he cares about you. He just wants to spend time with you. I've been Iooking all over for you. I thought we could have Iunch together? I'm not hungry. Here, just take that. Oh, God, sorry. It's my mother. Take it. She's probably just worried about you. I'll talk to you Iater. Hello? Sally, honey, it's me. Everything going good? Brilliant. Yeah? Oh, Marvin, can you turn the fan on? Yeah. Are you Iearning anything new? No, honey, I'm sorry, you're cutting out. - Where is he? - Hold on. - What? What the hell? - It's confusing. - It's fine, I got it. - Is the weather okay? I'm sorry. It's a universal remote. It's supposed to do this. - Mom, what's going on in there? - Nothing. Just hit the off button, Marvin. Can probably start the car with this thing. - Did you know that my father--? - Honey, what? My glasses, I can't see. --dinosaur freak. What? Whose father did what? - Just turn it off! - I got it. I got it. - Mom, Ray is one of our chaperones. - Look, honey, I can't hear you at all. I'll call you back Iater. I Iove you. I Iove you so much. - Bye. - Bye. I got the fan! But he's been in prison the Iast seven years. AII I'm saying is Ray-Ray was on the bus, the money was on the bus. - Like you said. - So you're saying he planned it? Ray-Ray did more than change his name in prison. - He became a mastermind. - Yeah, well.... - What a dump. - Yeah. If my friend can't sell it quickly, he's gonna torch it for the insurance. Real estate market is tough out here. - Put your guns down. - You put them down. - No, no, you put your guns down. - You put your guns down. Well, you shot the Iock of my door. He's right. Technically, we did shoot the Iock off his door. It was a nice Iock. AII right. - Happy now, Kevin? - It's been a while, Larue. - What do you want? - We need your help. Thank you, Mr. B. That extra time in the French Quarter made the day. Isn't it the most fascinating place? The food, the culture, the history, the voodoo? And to think, we'd never have had time for all that... ...if we hadn't Ieft the museum early. I know sometimes I get so attached to my schedule... ...I forget to Iive in the moment. Life is Iike a raging river, Miss M. You never know what's around the next bend. Make sure your boat doesn't Ieak and go with the flow. That's good advice. You know, the next time I think I'm gonna zig... ...I might just zag. Oh, and here's our hotel. Okay, everybody, Iisten up. You have exactly two hours inside the hotel-- And I do mean inside the hotel. --before this evening's festivities begin. In the meantime... ...your Iuggage will be taken into the Iobby. You will go to the front desk, register... ...get your keys, and settle into your rooms. If you understand, raise your hands! Very good. Sorry. Parmesan. - Wish me Iuck. - Good Iuck. You're going to die when you see the new me. I can't believe you're gonna do this. Angelina's Iips won't have anything on me. And he'll forget all about Iittle Miss Avril wannabe. How far are you from the Sheraton Hotel downtown? Okay, I need two hours to pick up my fireworks and get back. AII right, guys. Come on, kids. Nick, glad to have you back. Yeah, cool. You're the coolest, Miss M. - Hey. - Hey. - So why did you take my bus, man? - Sorry about that, buddy. I just got this thing about doing time-- I mean, being on time. We had plenty of time, bro. Did we really? I mean, is there ever really enough time, Nick? I mean, honestly, what is time? You can't save it, you can't spend it, right? And when it's gone, it's gone. Know what I mean? Does time even exist, Nick? If time doesn't exist... ...and there's just the moment, I had to seize that moment. - Do you know what I'm saying? - Yeah. I just don't understand how that applies to-- It doesn't apply, Nick. That's the beauty of it. - We're just glad you're back, man. - Cool. Now, can I get my green duffel bag? I'm gonna bring it in myself. Green duffel bag. Right. Yeah. This it? That's it. Thank you very much, my friend. Cool. We're cool? Now is not the time. Not that cool. Right. Okay. - Larue, it's Ray. - You lying... ...dirty, Iow-Iife, double-crossing son of a--! I didn't double-cross anybody, all right? I don't know how those cops got there or how your money got on the bus. If I had a plan, why would I wanna give your money back? Meet me in front of the Sheraton Hotel, I'll hand over your money. No way. You know we're onto you. You need us gone. You ain't gonna manipulate me again. - Hold on. - Don't put me on hold! - He put you on hold? - He put me on hold. - Hey. - Hey. How you doing? I've been giving you a hard time about being here. Not at all. Listen. If I was in your position, I'd be doing the exact same thing. So do you wanna get something to eat? Yeah, that'd be great. I gotta finish up a Iittle bit of business. Can I just meet you down in the Iobby in two minutes? - Okay. - Cool. AII right. - Continue. - What was that all about? - Nothing. - Is this another one of your tricks? Listen, all I wanna do is give you your money back. Good. We're gonna meet on my turf this time, all right? Warehouse Number 5. Clayton and Mott. Near the bridge. Fine. I'll be there in two hours. Two hours? Right now, Ray-Ray. Listen, I've got plans. You'll get your money. What, you think he's Iegit? No. Not for a second. But I got other ideas. - Josh, right? - Yes, sir. Josh, I've been out of the Ioop for a while... ...and you seem Iike a standup kid. - So-- - What's up? Well, I really don't know what kids Iike anymore, you know what I mean? - In particular, my kid. - Sally. Yeah. I'm Iooking for something cool to do with her today, you know, just her and I. Satchmo Music Festival not working out? It's just that with the music and all her friends, know what I mean? - We're not gonna be able to talk. - Well, that's true. AII right. Well, New Orleans is a cool city, so Iet me check online. I think there's something she will Iike. Hey, and Iet's keep this between you and me, right? - Nobody else's business, right? - You got it. You know what I think is interesting? That we both ate... ...the same part of the croissant. Don't you think that's interesting? Yes. I usually Iike jelly with my croissant... - Oh, sure. - ...instead of butter. - Or butter sometimes too. - Yeah. Excuse me. Miss M, I kind of got a favor to ask. Sure. Anything, Mr. B. Well, Sally and I haven't had too much time together Iately because of my work. I was wondering if it would be possible for us to maybe zig instead of zag. Maybe blow off the music festival... ...and she and I could spend some one-on-one time together? Why not? After all, you are a chaperone. So she'll be in very good hands. - Thanks, Miss M. You're the best. - Thanks. Hey, hey, hey. I did what you said. You know, every time she stopped talking... ...I counted, you know, in my head, of course, the two and a half. Boy, did she take me in. You changed my Iife. I'm not a big hugger, all right? Okay. You know, you can play that, you know... ...big, strong, Iean, handsome in that rugged kind of way... ...devil-may-care man's man all you want, Mr. Bradstone. But you have a tender side that can't be denied, my friend. Come on. Come. - That had better be your fanny pack. - Yeah. First thing I ever bought your mom was one of those antique hurricane Iamps. And I was never really the romantic type, you know? Matter of fact, I don't think I actually knew what the word meant. Until one night, I was a bartender at this restaurant... ...in walks your mom. She's gonna have dinner with some Ioser, right? Anyway, on the table, we had one of those hurricane Iamps... ...which, by the way, are a terrible pain to Iight. Anyway, the Iight from that Iamp on your mother's face... ...God, it was just magical, you know? Right then, I knew what romance was. Why...? Why do you think she married you? She said I made her Iaugh. This is it. - Music Factory? - Yeah. Come on. Thank you. - Excuse me. - Yeah. You got anything cool on vinyl Iike Sinatra, Zeppelin, Kellan Smith? Dude, eclectic taste. Sinatra, Zeppelin, Smith. Trifecta. I tip my hat. Come this way. Kellan Smith. - Yeah, you know him? - I Iove him. Really? I heard he was really good... ...but I wasn't sure. Thought I'd check him out. Who you Iooking for? Chairman of the Board, Frank Sinatra. - He's a Iittle bit before your time. - Definitely. - He's a Iittle bit before my time too. - Okay. So I started reading up on this guy when I was inside. And it turns out, we got a Iot in common, you know? We both hit rock bottom. He was sick and he was broke... ...and borrowing money from this actress chick, Ava Gardner... - ...who was huge at the time. - You're really into this guy. Well, we both turned our Iives around, you know? And Frank's music gave me hope. Hope Iike I hadn't had since you were born. Nothing? Sorry. - Why'd you do it? - What? Leave us. I made a Iot of mistakes in my Iife. I grew up with a Iot of the wrong people. I was trying to find an easy way to give you and your mom the things... ...that I thought you deserved. I didn't wanna get caught. How come the first five years you were away... ...you didn't write me a single Ietter? I thought you were better off without me. You know, and.... But then I started Iistening to Frank and Dr. Marjorie. And I started making up for Iost time. Yeah. I got those Ietters a Iittle Iate, don't you think? It's never too Iate. You gotta have faith in people. Faith? Do you have any idea what our Iives were Iike after you went away? Mom cried for months. For months? Your mom cried for months? Yeah. And school. Try explaining to your friends... ...why your dad can't come to your soccer games... ...or show up for parent night Iike the other dads. Because he's in jail. I know I've hurt you bad... ...and ""sorry"" doesn't cut it... ...but everything that I Iearned, everything, was to find my way back to you. This is Iovely. - The tea is Iovely. - And so is the company. Miss Miller? - Yes? - Excuse me. We're with the Lafayette Police Department. Do you know this man? Yes. He's one of our chaperones. Has he done something? Just got out of prison. He's a suspect in a bank robbery. Your class is in danger. Know where he is? No. No. Yes. Yes. He's out in New Orleans somewhere with his daughter... ...probably maybe robbing a bank. - Oh, my God! - Okay, okay. Remain calm. Gather the kids and Iet's gather up over here. Let's go. You know something, Ray.... Sally, you don't have to call me Ray, okay? Mr. Bradstone seems kind of odd, don't you think? Okay. I guess Ray is a step in the right direction. You know something, Ray... ...I had a good time today. Yeah? Me too. You should be with your friends. I'm sure Josh is Iooking for you too. Josh? He's a good kid. I Iike him. And he Iikes you too. I see it in his eyes. What are you going to do? Take a walk down by the river, enjoy the fresh air. You go have fun. And now some breaking news. Ray, alias ""Ray-Ray,""Bradstone, recently released... ...after serving seven years in federal prison for bank robbery... ...is a suspect in the robbery of the Lafayette Central Bank this morning. Other suspects include Phillip ""The Cat""Larue... ...Meyer ""Goldy"" Stentz, and Theodore ""Del""Muniz. You're Iate. Come here. Go. You stand right here. Okay. When I give you the signal, you start playing. - Okay? - Okay. Honey? You ready? - In a second. - Okay. --Meyer ""Goldy"" Stintz, and Theodore ""Del""Muniz. The fourth suspect, Ray-Ray Bradstone, is believed to be in New Orleans... ...after hijacking a Redwood Junior High School bus... ...on its way to a field trip. Lynne? Dinner's ready. Ready, ready. - Marvin, I'm Ieaving! - What? I get to spend some time with my Iittle girl today. Good time. Oh, I'm so happy for you, Ray. Everything is just working out Iike you said. - You changed my Iife. - Oh, we change our own Iives, Ray. You did that yourself. Just stuck to the three essentials. Confronted it, told the truth, she's Ietting it go. She's Ietting it go? What about you? I don't understand. Hey! Ray-Ray! Looks Iike she misses me already. Thanks for everything. Bye. Hi. - Oh, Iook. - It's Ray Bradstone, still at Iarge. - What? Just quoting the evening news. So glad we got to spend some quality time together, Ray-Ray. Guess I'll see you in another seven years. Sally, I swear, I had nothing to do with robbing that bank. Really? So they just flashed your mug shot on national TV... - ...for your adorable smile? - I was on the bus with you. And your fingerprints happened to be on the keys to the getaway car? Really? You are what you always were, a Iying criminal. - Don't say that word. - Which one? Liar or criminal? I said it again. Sally, I swear to you I didn't rob that bank. I mean, I was there and I was in the car, but I swear-- I knew it. I knew something was wrong the moment you got on the bus. I'm an idiot. I actually believed you had changed. Sally, wait. You're not an idiot and I have changed. Okay. I know I've Iet you and your mom down in the past... ...but I spent the Iast seven years of my Iife trying to figure out how to change that. I don't ever wanna be away from you again. I just need some time to figure out how to make this right. Please. How are we supposed to get out? Simple. Return the money, Iet them take the heat for it. What is it? I take it back, nothing is ever simple. Those guys are cops. Sally... ...I need you to do me a favor, okay? I've got nobody else. Please. What do you want me to do? I need you to go to my room, bring me the green duffel bag. Okay? Be careful. Nick, what's going on? Where is everybody? Lockdown, maximum security, extreme duress. Miss M is in, Iike, cardiac à Ia mode. Why? Why are we Ieaving? We can't Ieave yet. You tell me. My dad's a plumber. Oh, no, no, no. I want that bag with me. Hey. They're putting the class in Iockdown and we're Ieaving. I have to go back or they'll miss me and that's not good for you. Listen, I'll get rid of the money, I'll turn myself in. But they'll arrest you. Sally, Iisten. Something Dr. Marjorie said to me about Ietting go. Coming back here, forcing you into something you didn't want... ...it was wrong. What do you mean? I was thinking about my best interests, not yours. The Iast thing I ever wanted to do was put you in harm's way. Thank you. You're welcome. - What are you doing? - Shut up, stupid. Get in there. Get off me! No! You make a sound or Iook at me cross-eyed... ...I'll shoot your old man and shoot you in front of him. That makes no sense. - Sure, it does. - No, it doesn't, moron. What good would it do to shoot her in front of him if he's already dead? Okay, I might just shoot her now, you Iike that? Is that a better plan? You Iike that better? Then we'll have nothing to bargain with Ray-Ray for the money. - I'm guessing you're the Ieader. - Right, sweetheart. Process of elimination. I Iearned about it in statistics. And it's Ray, okay? Just once. Ray. You Ray-Ray Bradstone? Ray Bradstone, yeah. Come on in, brother. My friend Larue says you're a bad man. Not to underestimate you. So I brought my friends. Listen, guys... ...I just wanna give you back your money. Looks Iike it's just me and you. Hello? - Ray-Ray? - It's just Ray, moron. - You set me up? - Better than that. I figured even if you managed to get past the welcoming committee... ...I'd still need a backup plan. I'm not as stupid as you think I am. - Say hello. - Daddy? Sally? Oh, my God, okay. Sally, Iisten, I will come for you. Okay? You will be fine. - Do you hear me? - Daddy, please-- I can't believe how she's grown into such a woman. - I will kill you twice if you touch her. - Okay, good. So I can assume you're still in possession of my money since you're not dead yet. Larue, you are exactly as stupid as I thought you were. AII I wanna do is give you back your damn money... ...and instead you kidnap my daughter, you mo-- Hold on, Just Plain Ray. Not in front of the kiddies. Now, Iisten, I don't trust you as far as I can spit you. Okay? So here's how we're gonna do this. Tracy. Meredith? Hey, how'd it go? Ted, there you are. Where have you been? - Am I in trouble? - No, no. It's just, some unexpected things have happened... ...so now we're all waiting in there. You think I'm gonna Iose my job because I Iet a bank robber be a chaperone? Of course not. It not your fault. Everything's fine. - Everything's fine. - Miss Miller. I can't find Sally anywhere. Well, not to worry. I'm sure she'll be right along. Now I've Iost a child. And do you think that would be a good thing? No. No. No. You have any questions? I got it. Listen, my daughter's Iife is in your hands, all right? This is all the money I have in this world and you're the only person I can trust. - We good? - Sure. - No cops. - Sure. Hey, buddy. Little Sally here's been chatting up a storm. I can't wait to get rid of her. Good. Put her in the cab and you'll get your money. Where is it? I'm your insurance. Just Iet her get in the cab, money will appear Iike magic. Put her in the cab. My pleasure. Get in there. Smell you Iater, kid. Stop the cab. Stop the cab. Stop the cab. Something's wrong, stop the cab. Your father said no. Stop the cab! Stop the cab! Stop the cab! It's the wrong bag! You're scary, kid, but you're not as half as scary as your dad. I have never had so much trouble giving somebody money. I'd shoot you now, but I need that money. Listen, this is an honest mistake. I'm sure somehow the bags just got switched. It's probably on the bus. Not a big deal. This doesn't have to go bad. - You just Iet me shoot him right now. - Shut up. You worked it with Del and now you got something going on with that kid. Chip off the old block. Listen, you don't get it, Larue. That part of me, the guy that would have stolen your money, the criminal... ...is gone. I got rid of him. You guys can too. You know, I'm not saying it's easy. But Dr. Marjorie... ...she really helped me give birth to my new self. There's some great mental exercises in the back of this book that-- You know, or maybe not. Sally Bradstone? I'm Officer Fuentes. This is my partner, Augie Donaldson. Where's your father? No idea. Listen, Sally, the best way to help your father is just to tell us where he is. He didn't do anything. He wasn't a part of that robbery. He's our chaperone. He was on our bus. Yeah, then why's he running? And if that isn't true, concealing a criminal's whereabouts is felony. I don't know. He walked me back to the hotel then Ieft. I don't know where he is. Honest. AII right, I want you with the rest the class... ...until this is resolved, understand? Well, I'm so glad that you're safe and sound. Yeah, thanks. - Hey. - Hey. Listen, this thing with your dad must be kind of weird for you. He's innocent. He's just trying to straighten things out. Yeah, he's a good guy. I can tell. Yeah. - You've got an iPhone, right? - Yeah. - Have that app that tracks any iPhone? - Yeah. I need your help. I gotta find my dad. If you guys are planning an escape op, I'll be able to help. Me too. I wrote a paper Iast year called... ...""The Triangulation in the Cell Phone Jungle for Dummies""... ...and sent it to the CIA. - Did they read it? - Yeah, but dismissed it... ...saying that it was the fantasies of an overimaginative 13-year-old. My dad says the same thing to me. The point is, if you need something, or someone, found, I'm your man. Go for it. When was the Iast time your father used his phone? About minutes ago. - I'm assuming a Lafayette area code. - Yes. - Where? - The Riverwalk. - Got it. - Wow, you're kind of scary. Thanks. Okay, okay. You're in. Here's what I was thinking. We have to distract Miss Miller, okay? I have to go to the bathroom. AII right. It's right down the hall. Don't be Iong. Somebody has a gun in the bathroom! Oh, no, he's mine. Nick, open the door. Nick, Miss Miller is in trouble. She needs you inside. - Me? - Yes. Really? Cool. - Let's go. - AII right, come on. - Close the door. - Okay, what--? Hit any button. - Which button? - Hit any button. That one. - Sit down and hang on. I can do this. - You don't even know how to drive a car. Who's driving the bus? Sally. Remember what I said about you not being fired? You're toast. This is kidnapping. Endangering the Iife of a minor. I'm calling my Iawyer. Holy crap. What happened to your Iips? They're supposed to Iook Iike Jessica Simpson's. Look Iike you tried to suck honey out of a beehive. - Keep going straight. - Okay. - I'm calling the cops. - Red Iight. Red Iight. Red Iight. Yeah! This day just keeps getting better. Where is it? I told you, it's probably on the bus. Don't do that. Don't insult my intelligence. I've got witnesses that will swear I was on that bus... ...before the robbery even went down. How do I know that's not the plan with Del? With Del? I didn't even know Del before the robbery. I Ieft to be with my daughter. Oh, so now you're Father of the Year. You don't know that kid any more than you know Del. ""Anger dwells only in the bosom of fools."" Einstein. ""A bullet that dwells in the brain... ...Ieaves much pain."" ""Leaves much pain."" Larue. This is it. Pull in here. - Hold on. - Cool. Now Iisten to me, everybody. I've spent just enough time with my father today to realize... ...he's not the man I thought he was. He's made some mistakes, but he's a good man. At Ieast he's trying to be. Now he's in there, and I'm going to get him out. But, guys, I need help. I mean, what if it was your dad in there? I wouldn't get off this bus if my entire family was in that place. - So, what's the plan? - Plan? A plan? Yes. ""AII men can see these tactics whereby I conquer... ...but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved."" Sun Tzu, my friends. Let's not just do this, Iet's step up to this. Yeah. Come on. Quiet. Not so Ioud. Guys. Open it. Okay. You guys go that way, we'll go this way. Signal us when you're ready. Got it? Roger that. - Come on. - Let's go. We gotta be careful. This is scary. For the Iast time... ...where's that money? On the bus. Maybe he's telling the truth. I'm telling you, he's full of crap. It's his mastermind brain that's trying to trick us again. The eagle has Ianded. I repeat, the eagle has landed. Okay, guys, you know what to do. Go. Police department, state your emergency. Finally. My emergency is that I'm on the field trip from hell. I'm having trouble understanding what you're saying. - Are you in immediate danger? - Yes. First of all, I think my Iips may actually explode. AII right. You go in that way. I'm going this way. My God, I'm gonna make a hideous dead person. Please help me. Okay, all right. You're going down. Now! - Let it go and move on. - The Dr. Marjorie Show. Hello? What are you doing? Get up, man. - What is this? - Rotten kids. Caller? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? - Dad. - Mr. Bradstone. - Untie me. - I got it. - Got it? - Yeah. - Come on, let's go. - Let's go. - Where you going? - Don't shoot. I have the money. - Yeah? Well, Iet's see it. - It's right here. AII right. Looks Iike it's all there. Let's see if I get this straight. He has taken-- You gotta hear this. I think it's Ray Bradstone. Caller, hold for one minute, please. - Your kid's smarter than you, Ray-Ray. - It's Ray. Plain Ray. Now Iet us go. You have your money. Oh, not so fast. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a very unusual call. It appears we have a crime in progress. Now, we have alerted 911. - We have called.... - AII units in the vicinity of Mott... ...possible shots fired, suspicious activity. - Proceed with extreme caution. - Let's go. --and see what we hear. Ray wasn't part of that robbery, was he? No. That doesn't mean he didn't set it up to rip us off for sending him to prison. You are the reason my dad went to jail? No, Sally, that's on me. - They just Iet me take the fall alone. - My dad's innocent. AII he wants is to be a father again. Oh, yeah? That really brings a tear to my eye. - You're dead. - No! - Bye-bye, Ray-Ray. - Nobody move! Drop your weapon! Drop it! - Cuff him. - AII right, Iet's go. Don't move. Hands behind your back. Let's go. - Bye-bye, Larue. - You got Iucky this time, Ray. Move out, move out. Well, Iadies and gentlemen, I think that's a first for me. And maybe all of radio. We just heard the apprehension of criminals broadcast Iive on .6 FM... ...The Dr. Marjorie Show. And looks like our caller, well, he got everything he hoped for. - Hey, hold on a second. Ray Bradstone? - Yeah. You're under arrest for the robbery of Lafayette National Bank. - But he's innocent. - Step back. Police matter. - I witnessed it. - Hey, you can take him off. Wait. Hold on. What? Apparently, the whole thing just went down Iive on WKNO. May even give Larue a radio show from the slammer. He confessed to the whole thing. - Sorry about this, Ray. - Thanks. It turns out you were right to believe him. He did keep his promise. He did. I appreciate it. Sally. - My God, are you all right? - I'm okay. I'm all right. - Is this your idea of being a parent? - Mom, no. Please Iisten to me. - He didn't do anything wrong. - It's okay, Sally. I deserve that. And that's for Ieaving us seven years ago. - I deserve that too. - No. You don't. Trust me, Mom. I could have you arrested for endangering the Iives of these kids. You could. I wouldn't blame you one bit. Mom. Don't you think he spent enough time in jail? Maybe so. - Dad. - Yeah? You remember the handshake? Thank you, Sally. - You nervous? - Definitely. My hands are shaking. About the new job or the first date? Both. It's been a Iong time in either case. Well, you're gonna be awesome at both. And just wait till you actually have a car. You know, dates and jobs get easier with cars. Well, job first. I'll worry about the car Iater. When I get ahead of myself, that's how I get in trouble. Good point. Okay, you ready? - Ready as I'm gonna be. - Okay. Okay. Come on. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Hey. Hey. Okay. Next caller, please. Ray-Ray-- I mean, it's just plain old Ray. Larue? - First-time caller. - You're a sweet thing, all right. I'm having a Iittle trouble-- Excuse me. I'm having trouble adjusting... ...to my environment. Well... ...you know, Larue, at this point... ...I think the best thing for you to remember is the three essentials: Confront it... ...be truthful... ...and sleep with your back against the wall."
77,2014,22 Jump Street,American,"Two years following their success in the 21 Jump Street program, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are back on the streets chasing narcotics. However, after failing in the pursuit of a group of drug dealers led by Ghost (Peter Stormare), Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) puts the duo back on the program to work for Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) – now located across the street at 22 Jump Street. Their assignment is to go undercover as college students and locate the supplier of a drug known as ""WHY-PHY"" (Work Hard? Yes, Play Hard? Yes) that killed a student photographed buying it on campus from a dealer.
At college, Jenko quickly makes friends with a pair of jocks named Zook (Wyatt Russell) and Rooster (Jimmy Tatro), the latter being a prime suspect of the investigation. Jenko starts attending parties with the jocks who do not take as kindly to Schmidt. Meanwhile, Schmidt gets the attention of an art student, Maya (Amber Stevens), by feigning an interest in slam poetry. The two sleep together, to the disapproval of Maya's roommate Mercedes (Jillian Bell), and Schmidt later finds that Maya is the daughter of Captain Dickson, whom Schmidt bragged to about ""getting laid"", much to Dickson's fury. Despite sleeping together, Maya tells Schmidt not to take it seriously, and he starts to feel left out as Jenko bonds more and more with Zook who encourages him to join the football team.
When Schmidt and Jenko are unable to identify the dealer, they visit Mr. Walters (Rob Riggle) and Eric (Dave Franco) in jail for advice. After confessing the two are having regular intercourse, Walters points out a unique tattoo on the arm of the dealer in the photograph. Whilst hanging out with Zook and Rooster, Jenko notices that Rooster does not have the tattoo but sees it on Zook's arm. Schmidt and Jenko are invited to join the fraternity led by the jocks, but Schmidt refuses, furthering the tension between the two as Jenko passes their requirements. They later realize that Zook is not the dealer but rather another customer. Soon afterwards, they find Ghost and his men on campus, but Ghost again evades them. Jenko reveals to Schmidt that he has been offered a football scholarship with Zook and is uncertain about his future as a police officer. Afterwards, Schmidt reveals his true identity and moves out of the dorm, angering Maya.
Spring break arrives, and Schmidt goes after Ghost. He is joined by Jenko, so the two can have one final mission together. The pair head to the beach where Ghost is likely to be dealing WHY-PHY. Inside a bar, they find Mercedes, who is Ghost's daughter, giving instructions to other dealers. The pair, backed up by Dickson and the rest of Jump Street, ambush the meeting. Ghost flees, while Mercedes is knocked out by Schmidt. While pursuing Ghost, Jenko is shot in the shoulder. Ghost attempts to escape in a helicopter; Schmidt and Jenko manage to jump across to it, but they fall into the sea due to Jenko's injured arm. However, Jenko is able to throw a grenade into the helicopter. Ghost celebrates his victory prematurely while the grenade explodes, sending the totalled remains into the sea. Jenko tells Schmidt that he still wants to be a police officer as he believes their differences help their partnership, and the two reconcile in front of a cheering crowd. Dickson approaches them claiming to have a new mission undercover at a med school.
During the credits, Jenko and Schmidt go on to a variety of undercover missions to different schools, which are portrayed as fictional sequels, an animated series, and a toy line. One mission features Detective Booker (Richard Grieco) while another sees the return of Ghost, who survived the helicopter explosion. In a post-credits scene, Walters reveals to Eric that he is late, implying he is pregnant.",7.0,tt2294449,"NARRATOR READING PREVIOUSLY ON JUMP STREET SCHOOL BELL RINGING You're a fucking nerd. Boy, you lucky you even graduating. SCHMIDT: Fuck! ALL: Oh! You're good at this, huh? Yeah. You're really good at this. Yeah. Hey, you want to be friends? Yours isn't loaded, right? BOTH GAGGING Just touch it. I'm scared. Just touch it. Seriously. All right, all right, all right. You took a bullet for me, man. You shot me in the dick! Boom, motherfuckers! You two sons of bitches are going to college! Yin is characterized as slow, soft, passive and is associated with water and femininity. While, Yang, by contrast, is fast and solid and... Man, this is BS. I thought we were going to actual college, not online college. Listening for coded messages in lectures. SCOFFS What are you talking about? Look around. This is our city. What do we want to be in college for? You're right. Partners for life. At Metro city port, the tide comes in at 10:30 A.M. Then it will return to the sea. Metro port. One hour.   let's do this.  Turn down for what  turn down for what surprise. There's two more arms.    turn down for what  turn down for what  shit! That's the ghost. JENKO: The ghost? Joste nillsen, biggest trafficker of illegal goods in Metro city. He teamed up with a Mexican cartel and they're running all this shit through the port. What the hell are we supposed to be buying? I don't know. What are you doing? Huh? I got a new identity that's gonna be killer. I'll be throwing it to you to make it legit. SIGHS Okay. I'm gonna need you to improvise. Okay? I don't want to improvise. I'm gonna need you to improvise. I suck at improvising. I don't want to do it. I need absolute silence while I fall into character. I need absolute silence while I fall into character. Can you give me a head start on... I need absolute... I need absolute silence. Can you please... Absolute silence.   JENKO: Are you fucking serious right now? All right. I hate people who are late. SPEAKING SPANISH We're trying to see that product. Shit! Yo, sleepy! What's up, homie? You know my cousin, sad boy. I think you got the wrong guy, homes. Oh, that's bullshit, man! You sleepy! Everyone say in the barrio, sleepy, he like the Mexican Wolverine and shit. Hey, my partner here, he want to see the product. Why ain't he talking? IN FOREIGN ACCENT My name is Jeff. That's jeffe, man. Tell 'em about mousie's quinceanera, man. Tell 'em about that crazy adventure you guys had. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, man, when you were telling the story last night, you had so much detail! The detail was so rich! It was rich detail! STAMMERING Go into incredibly descriptive details of the story, so we all know. Oh, yes. SIGHS It was Dora and Diego and swiper. Swiper? Who was that you choked out, man? He had it coming! Who was that? Boots. No, man, that wasn't boots! Boots isn't a real name! You got to tell them the real story, man. Start over from the top. That's a made-up name. I can't believe the punks I have to deal with these days. It really makes me miss the '90s, when we had professionals around. You want to check out the goods? Check it out. And shut up. Right? Where'd you find this gringo, man? At the fucking Mumford  sons concert and shit? LAUGHS SOFTLY What is it? Guns? Drugs? HISSING SCREAMING No! No! Dude! It's gross! It's inking in my mouth! I'll get it off. Its tentacle is eating me! It's so strong! It's really on there, man. It's biting my face! SCREAMS Shit! Black market exotic animals, just like we expected to be in there. The accents are gone, huh? Take them out, guys. They're cops. GUNS FIRING What was that? I don't know! I think we're moving. We're definitely moving! JENKO: There's fucking birds and shit in here! There's actual shit! SCHMIDT: What the fuck? There's a fucking dragon in here! SCREECHING SCREAMING Shit! What was that? Dude, that was our car. We shared so much in that car! I'm going to shoot them in the face for that! That was our fucking car! What are you doing? Don't teen wolf on the truck! Don't leave me here alone! Then get up here! I can't do that! Then fucking climb around. Come on, climb around. Let's go. Come on, buddy. You got it. SCHMIDT: This is so scary! Shoot him! SCHMIDT: Don't leave me out here! I'm all out. You stupid moron! That's it. Come on. GRUNTING Fucking get up here. Come on. Fuck! All right, you good? Yeah! All you got to do is walk now, okay? Okay. SCREAMS Shit! What the fuck are you doing? Get up here! I can't! All right, fine, I guess I'll just drag you. I'm gonna die! You're not gonna die. Just get the fuck up here! SCHMIDT CONTINUES SCREAMING TIRES SCREECHING Pull yourself up here. Use your core! You got it, you got it. Come on, come on. Yeah! All right. Think you can stand on your own now? Yes! I think we lost them. Shit! He's the fucking Terminator! That's fucking dangerous! You are under arrest! Pull the truck over! I said pull the fucking truck over right fucking now! You owe me a car, and it'd better be a fucking Lamborghini, you bitch! I did it! You have the right to remain silent. Oh, shit! BOTH SCREAMING Holy Moses! SCHMIDT: Shit. JENKO GRUNTS JENKO: What happened? SCHMIDT: I think they got away. Is that a hickey? Oh. This was actually an octopus-related incident. I'd opened a crate and the octopus had leapt onto my face. Apparently, they have many, many arms. They have eight tentacles. Yes, and... Look, ladies, nobody gave a shit about the jump street reboot when you first came on. Anyone with half a brain, myself included, thought it was destined to fail spectacularly. But you got lucky. So now this department has invested a lot of money to make sure jump street keeps going. We've doubled their budget. As if spending twice the money guaranteed twice the profit. LAUGHING Like that's going to work. Yeah. Well, the commissioner's convinced this debacle happened because you weren't doing the same undercover student thing you did the first time. She doesn't get that it's always worse the second time around. You settle into worn-out roles. One gets possessive, the other runs away. You begin a slow, painful unraveling, as all the good things that came before begin to be crushed by the trash compactor of sadness. That doesn't sound like us. I mean... CHUCKLES I'm getting a divorce. We don't want to do the same thing. We want to burst through our ceiling. And you're gonna find another ceiling and you got to bust through that one, and you just got to keep hammering ceilings. Okay, okay, okay. What if we actually went into the secret service and, like, tried to protect the white house? I think... I don't think that would work. I'm going to ask you to stop talking. I thought it was a pretty good idea. Do the same thing as last time, everyone's happy. I can't believe the Koreans bought their church back. Yeah. Good thing there was an even bigger abandoned church directly across the street. Yeah. That's convenient. Yes, it is convenient. Next year, we'll probably just be right back across the street. Just next door. SCOFFS Let's not get ahead of ourselves. We're not ahead of ourselves. We're right next to each other. This is awesome. Like, way more expensive for no reason. Look at dickson's office. Looks like a giant cube of ice. How you bitches like jump street now? Hey! Y'all see this shit? jump street is the lick. And I got a big-ass raise to babysit you two fuckers again. Designed it myself. We got an espresso bar. I'm thinking about a shark tank over there. Ooh, I like sharks. Fuck a jump street, and fuck a Korean Jesus. Whoa! Cap, come on, Korean Jesus is right there. DICKSON: That's Vietnamese Jesus. See, this a Vietnamese church. You racist, sacrilegious sack of shit. Look at that. Vietnamese Jesus just dripping swagoo. And we got some new dumb-ass interns. Hey, hey! Look alive! Huh? CHUCKLES Boys. Yo, jenko. GRUNTING Hey, Schmidt! Don't do that. So, they want the same shit, so here we go. Same identities. Same assignment. JENKO: We're going back to high school? Your ass look like you about 50. You're going to MC state. We're going to college for real? Somebody's out there, they're cooking up a new drug. It's Adderall mixed with ecstasy mixed with God knows what else. JENKO: Wipey? No, you dumb motherfucker. Whyphy. Stands for work hard? Yes. Play hard? Yes. Now, these kids take this shit, and they get laser-focused for about four hours of studying, and then they party like it's goddamn 1999. SCHMIDT: Who's this? That's Cynthia Watson. She was a student at MC state. She took some whyphy, got locked out of her dorm, ended up falling off the roof. And now she's dead. That's her buying drugs on campus. And that's the dealer. Find him and we find the supplier. Sir, can I just say, it is so refreshing to have a case with a black victim. I mean, we care so much more because she's black. I think what he's really trying to say is that we care equally. It's a tie, really, how much we care. Uh... no, we're not. If it was a white person, I wouldn't even care. One less cracker-ass cracker to worry about. Why every time you speak I want to throw the fuck up? Infiltrate the dealer, find the supplier.   INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS You all right? Yeah. It's just... I'm the first person in my family to pretend to go to college. Best part is we get to do it together. What's up, college? What's up, bro? We're 322. Fuck high school, right? Fuck high school. Oh, so tight! Oh, this is so baller! Beds... oh, shit. GROANS Oh, dope. That looks like cum. That's cum. Okay. All right. Already got cum on the mattress, dawg. Welcome to college. Fuck, yeah. Hilarious shirt that signals we drink alcohol. Some bacon machine that my mom got me. I do not understand how it works. It's true. JENKO: Super high-tech police gear. Carte Blanche with the budget, motherfucker. I'm going to veto that poster. It's a touch childish. Okay. What do lambos have to do with touching children? Lambos are lame. I get one choice. I get one thing that I'm not... We have to agree. You know what I mean? What up, fellas? We're your across-the-hall neighbors. Oh, hey, there's two of you. You're twins. What's up, man? We're the yangs, man. Kenny Yang. What's up? Keith Yang. What's going on? What's going on? Did you say the yangs? Yeah, dad's Chinese, man. Our mom's not Chinese. She's black. Oh. She's like real black. Like Wesley snipes black. Exactly. We're brothers, too. BOTH CHUCKLING No. He's not kidding. He's serious. Oh, really? What? Like, one of y'all older? Mmm-hmm. Yeah, 'cause you got crow's feet under your eyes, man. You specifically. We're actually just normal college age. I mean, even if you're a little older, that's cool, man, because, you know, girls here love older dudes. That's true. Plus, there's mad fuckable girls here. Mad fuckable. Especially during spring break. JENKO: I love spring break. But I do have to say, I've fucked a thousand girls by now and I don't know, at the end of the day, you just kind of want something that's just a little deeper really. BOTH: Yeah, balls deeper. Jinx. Buy me a coke. Oh, snap, we're still saying the same thing. This is amazing! Carrots. Pumpernickels. Glow sticks. Twins! That's dope, dude. That's so sick. That's crazy. We have that brother connection, too. You ready? Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Pirates! Baby feet! Paper clips! Bananas! Sun! Anger! I don't know! Words! Quicksand! Shoes! Boom! That's hip-hop, man. Awesome. That's great. It's gonna be super fun. All right? Same as last time. Dude, if it's like last time, you're gonna have an awesome time, and it's gonna suck for me. No. You're gonna have an awesome time, too, because I'm gonna make sure of it. You took a bullet for me. That's right, I did, and it sucked, but I'd do it again. No way. It's my turn. I owe you a life debt. SINGSONG Co-ed bathrooms. What? Oh, shit. WHISPERING I'm not gonna take a shit the entire time I'm here. I know. Hey. How you doing? Hey. What's up? 'Sup? Just exhausted from inventing Facebook or whatever website people our age use. JENKO: They still have books? I thought they just put the books inside the computers. Yeah, I guess the kids just use the stacks to hide and have sex. So we'll go to all Cynthia's classes and activities, ask around about the drug and find out who the dealer is. Yeah, it's just like last time. Exactly like last time. Dude, in human sexuality, do you get to fuck or do you just get to watch people fuck? Neither. What the fuck am I taking it for, then? Now, obviously, we've all heard this statement before, I've got a first impression for you. CLEARS THROAT MIMICKING TRACY MORGAN Oh, y'all like psychology? Tracy Morgan. Nobody? SOFTLY Work hard, play hard, am I right? You looking for some whyphy? Yeah, man, that'd be sick. Go to the police station, walk in and ask your captain to see the evidence room 'cause you're a fucking narc. I think you're mistaken. LAUGHS You're literally wearing your badge. Did you really just check to see if you were wearing your badge? This guy's a fucking cop. I didn't look down. Wait, Professor Jacobs, doesn't history happen a long time ago? Well, history happens... This class is such a gut. Hey, you guys play football? No, this is actually my laptop. Yeah, I'm taking notes right now. I'm kidding. It's a football. Mr. mcquaid? Covalent bonds. EXHALES LOUDLY What has been the result of the war on drugs? Why would you ask me? I'm not a cop. Because this is a college seminar, and that's how college seminars work. Professor gets into a lively conversation with the student. Friction creates fire, and that leads to lessons learned. Well, it's definitely harder to get drugs. I can personally tell you that. The average price of cocaine has dropped 70 in the last years. Then your dealer's probably selling you some pretty stepped-on shit. STUDENTS LAUGHING Mr. mcquaid, college is a wonderful place. This is where you get to decide who you actually are, instead of the person that you're clearly pretending to be right now, which everyone sees through, by the way. You got to decide, do I just keep doing the same thing, or am I gonna choose a different path and question my convictions? I don't have any prior convictions. Why are you saying this stuff? That's exactly the answer I wanted, Mr. mcquaid! I want you to question what I'm saying. This is the basis of this whole course, and that's the beauty of college. You can say whatever you want. You can be whatever you want. I mean, I have tenure. I can really say whatever I want. George Washington was a black lesbian. The Eiffel tower is made of dildos. They can't fire me. I'm indestructible. SMACKING LIPS I'm sleeping with two of my students. Her and her. I actually am. Now, just like you did before, I want you right now to say whatever you want. Say whatever you want. Fieto. Fieto, not a word, but I'm gonna accept it. You can do whatever you want with your life, Mr. mcquaid. The only way you can fail this class is by not becoming who you truly are. Please respond to my text. MALE STUDENT: Okay, we got time for just one more improve game. For this one, we need a ton of different suggestions. So, we just need you guys to fill in the blank in a sentence that we're gonna set up. So it'll go like this. Oh, I'm so hungry, I wish I had a... Tampon! Okay, but we want... We want it to be actual food so that it, like, makes sense with the game. It's more fun that way. So, uh, let's try it one more time. Oh, I've got to get home so I can feed my... Boner! You know what? Let's just play the game, okay? GIRL: All right, so what would you... Hey, that girl's in my psych class. Damn, she's hot. Go talk to her. You come talk to her with me. Stop being a pussy and go talk to her. Go. All right, all right. Coming to the stage, we got... J. Bohnes, aka... Hey. Hi. I think we're in the same psych class. Oh, yeah. Hi. Yeah. Pills! Pills! Bills! Pills! Bills! A sign of the times that rhymes Amanda Bynes drop that raggedy Andy circus circle jerkus... You guys are the improve guys, right? Yeah. That's cool. You're the guy with the terrible suggestions. Yeah, yeah. You're welcome, man. Yeah. Thanks, guys. Um, lady J is gonna be up next for you. Cynthia, that girl who died, she used to come here all the time, right? Mmm. This piece is called areolas. Did you know her? Yeah, she lived across the hall from me. Yeah? So why do you care so much? I'm... I'm writing a... Greedy man hands! ...a slam poem in her honor. Early stages, very early stages. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah. Wouldn't it be better just to, like, plan the stuff out ahead of time, and then not say it in front of people and embarrass yourself? That's a thing that people do. That's stand-up comedy. That's probably what you should do, because that stuff's funny. My brown nipple will produce white milk during lactation... What do you think of this? I actually think it's really powerful. That's cool that you said that, 'cause I actually thought it was really powerful, too, when the one girl was talking about her nips and shit. APPLAUSE Okay, does anybody have anything they want to share? Let's see what you got. Any more poets in the audience? I... I mean, do you really do poetry? I do, and I will. I got somebody. What? Okay, we got somebody. All right, give it up, guys. Yeah! Okay. Just go up there. All right, okay. Okay. No pressure. You'll see, it's good. Yeah! LAUGHS Um... This is a work in progress. So, uh... Slam poetry! Yelling! Angry! Waving my hands a lot! Specific point of view on things Cynthia! ENUNCIATING Cynthia Jesus died for our sin-thee-uhs Jesus cried runaway bride Julia Roberts! Julia rob hurts LAUGHING Cynthia! GROANS Cynthia you're dead you are dead SCATTING You're dead that's for Cynthia, who's dead. ALL APPLAUDING Whoo! I don't have a single lead. I do. I hear you can get whyphy on campus anywhere 247. Do you think they mean whyphy the drug or WI-Fi like the Internet? What... Fuck you, brain. How did we find the dealers so easy the first time? Well, his number was literally on a sticker. Well, let's go find this guy's sticker. I don't think this guy does stickers. Well, we need help. We need to consult an expert. KENNY: Yo, dude, you shot him in the dick, dude. I got him in the dick. Yep. Shot him in the dick. LAUGHING If it isn't Turner and hooch, in the flesh. Holy shit, you are looking fit. GRUNTS Hey, you should get some tips from this guy. He's looking good. Look at those pectoral muscles. That's the kind of definition I want out of you, man. What's up, Eric? Hey. Mr. Walters, we should, um... Or I should apologize for, uh... For shooting my penis off? Yeah. Yeah. Don't sweat it, brother. I'm liberated. Totally. You know they gave me a vagina? It's awesome. You guys want to see it? No, no, no, no! No, no, no. That's fine. All right. Eric's seen it. Eric's been all up in that shit. Isn't that right, Eric? You guys got to get me the fuck out of here. Hey, guess what. I'm Eric's bitch. No, you're not. Yes! I am! I'm your bitch. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, honey. I didn't mean that. You know that, right? I am such a bitch when aunt Flo shows up. It bleeds so much, it's crazy. It's like the elevator doors opening in the shining. Your vagina doesn't fucking work, man. Worked for you last night. CHUCKLES You are so clearly forcing Eric into this relationship. Eric, am I forcing you into anything? Yes. CHUCKLES See? Look, they sent us in undercover at a college to find the dealer of this new synthetic, and no one will tell us anything. That's 'cause you guys look like fucking narcs, all right? College kids aren't dumb like Eric. I was supposed to go to Berkeley. Well, they gave us a picture, so we do have that. Well, that's your lead, motherfucker! That's what you start with. I know, but we can't see his face, so we don't know who it is. We don't know who it is. I'm Schmidt. My pants are filled with doody. GROANS That's you. That doesn't sound anything like me. You sort of sound like that. That doesn't sound anything like me. That doesn't sound anything like me. It's not not you. Eric! Close your eyes and tell me who's talking right now. BABBLING That's Schmidt being a little bitch. That's just not a good impression. WALTERS: Whoa! Nice job, super sleuths. Did you even bother to look at the fucking picture? Yeah. Huh? There's a reflection right here. Your fucking guy's got a tattoo. Find the tattoo, find the dealer. Fuck, man, I don't know. I do a lot of stupid tattoos to drunk kids. Do you remember that stupid tattoo? TATTOO ARTIST: A bazooka? Think I might have did it on a football player. Guy with a red Mohawk. I don't know. They all start to look the same to me. I think I know exactly who he's talking about. GRUNTING Fuck you! Fuck you, you little walk-on fuck! I can't, like, move around in these things. ROOSTER: God, I love walk-on day! WHISPERS Fuck, yeah. That's a weird time to be q-tipping. You're all fucking pussies! Dude, you don't have to do this. What? I just don't want you to get hurt. I'm not gonna get... Whoops. GRUNTS Shit. Whoa. Dude, I am so sorry. It's all right, man. Don't worry about it, man. Are you sure? All right... Yeah. Ow. Shit. I got it. Okay, I got it, I got it. Ow! That's fine. I'll get it. No, no, let me get it, let me get it. No, I got it. Let me just get it. No, let me get it. I got it, I got it. Let's just... Dude, I'm sorry. I got my q-tip in your meat, bro. No, man, I got my...

It's a meat-qute sandwich. Me and this guy are having a meat-qute. LAUGHING You're hilarious, dude. What's your name? Brad. Wait... Brad. Uh, yeah, yeah, it's Brad. I'm Zook. Nice to meet you. Zook. Nice to meet you, too, man. ZOOK: Blue 20! Blue 20! Set, hut!   LAUGHS You love walk-on day now? GROANS Your arm all right? You want to take that sleeve off? No, I'm good. Dude, holy shit, bro.

We'll see what we can do. Also, I said a bunch of stuff earlier that you didn't acknowledge... Great catch. Cool, yeah. See you then. So you won't address that? What the fuck's up with that guy? All we have to do now is rush the frat long enough to confirm that rooster has that bazooka tattoo. Look, man, do you think it's cool if you come? 'Cause, I mean, he kind of really just asked me. I just don't want to start off on the wrong foot with this guy. LAUGHS Dude, you're tripping. We do everything together. You should lose the puka shells, though. Things are different since you didn't go to college. MUSIC PLAYING Yo, Brad! What's up, dude? Same puka, dude. You got the same... Puka bros. ZOOK: Holy shit! BOTH LAUGHING Look at him, it's, like, all the same. Dude, you wear pants, too? What? Bros, man. Dude. I knew we were gonna be connected, just like that. Yeah, why don't you guys just tie your dicks together and get married, right, rooster? Rooster. What's up, bro? You look good, man. What's up, rooster? How you doing, man? Digging the puka. Thanks, dude. I can't believe it's the same... How you doing, rooster? Rooster is getting some pop. Why don't you go check him out? JENKO: You in the zone, bro? ZOOK: In the fucking zone, dude. IMITATING EXPLOSIONS Hey. What's up? What's up? I'm rooster. Oh, yeah, no. We've met before. Oh, really? I don't remember that at all. You must just have a really plain face. Yeah. They call me ol' plain face. They call you that? So, do you have any body art or, like, any ink I could see? That's a pretty random question. Hey, anyway, it was so nice chatting with you, man. Nice to meet you, man. Yo, what the fuck, bro? Yo, what the fuck are you doing, dude? You serious right now? You... You're being weird. You've been weird. JENKO: It was just like, what am I hearing?

So you definitely cannot talk any shit, 'cause... No, I can't. I cannot. ...you're never gonna make any money. LAUGHS I'm never gonna make any money, so don't tell my parents, but... When I talk to your parents tonight, I will not tell them about your major. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. All right, art major. What do you think about that? Um, I would say that it's these two beings leaning up against each other in perfect balance. If one were to fall, they would just lose each other. So it's just about support. You can't admit that it looks exactly like testicles? LAUGHING That's exactly what it looks like. So, is there someone who supports you? No, I'm just one of those people that really likes to spend time with myself. Tell me about it. I love to be alone. I am, like, the best at it. I just love when you're sitting there in a room, and you're just there with your thoughts, and you're like, oh, my gosh, I'm alone. Would anyone ever love me? Or whatever. And, like, do I know anyone who would care if I just ever came out of this room or not? Or whatever and, like... I don't know. It's just peaceful. I just like it. Yeah. Well, if you don't want to be alone tonight, we are gonna go hang out at the art building, if you want to come. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. MUSIC PLAYING CHEERING I expected tonight would go in a way that you wouldn't expect, but what I didn't expect was tonight would go in the exact way that you would expect. You know what I mean? Totally. So you guys hang out here a lot? Yeah. I mean, we're not into the whole frat party kind of stuff. We like to sit around, just drink some good wine and talk about some important stuff. Banging bitches and getting wasted all fucking day. Those are, like, two of my favorite things to do. You are, like, a slightly less attractive version of... Picasso? Picasso. Right? I've been told that before. You read my mind. LAUGHING What? ALL EXCLAIMING ALL CHEERING SIGHS Oh, that's Cynthia Watson's room. Oh. It's only 2:00. I thought it was late. Do you want to come in? It's only 2:00? I usually go to dinner at, like, 2:00 A.M., so... Sure, yeah, why not? ROOSTER: I'm gonna do it. I just got to get it at the right angle. GROANS Dude, stop. Rooster: Stupid fucking goalpost! It's impossible. You can't fucking do it. The fans used to rush the field after every win and tear down the goalposts, and coach hated it. And so he cemented them in. They storm the field, and still do it, but they just bounce around. ROOSTER: Fuck this goalpost, bro! You guys might want to hold on, 'cause this shit is coming down. BELLOWING Yo, what is that? The tattoo, what's that right there? Oh. Oh, this? Mmm-hmm. It's my old high school team. The plainview red herrings. Look at it swim. Shit. What? Shit, that's a really outside-of-the-box high school mascot. Hold on, guys. ZOOK: Hey, why don't you come to practice today? I mean, you're obviously good enough to play on the team. Look, I'm not supposed to be here to play football. What? I'm just here to do my assignments and get out, that's it. I mean, yeah, school's important or whatever, but when I was throwing you those passes, it was like I knew where you were gonna be before you went there. You know, I had this, like, vision of me throwing bullet tds to you, dude, and then all these fans just started going, like... QUIET SCREAMING Zook! Mcquaid! Zook! Mcquaid! And they were chanting and chanting, and then the goalposts came down. Dude? I have had that exact vision, like, my entire life. Dude. Dude. Bro? Bro. Dude. Bro. BOTH: Dude. Like, well, we fucking can, bro. All you gotta do is join the team. Yeah. Why not? Yes! Fuck yeah, dude. Fuck yeah, dude. What's that? My tattoo. Yeah, fuck, look. Look, it's me, Zook. Got a fucking bazooka for an arm. Know what I mean? IMITATES EXPLOSION SIGHS Dude, I'm so fucking pumped you're gonna be on this fucking team, bro. BOTH CHUCKLE Yep. What's up with it? SNORTS How you doing? Hi. Good. How was the, um... BREATHES DEEPLY How was the sex for you? It was fun for me. It was a good time. Yeah, right. I enjoyed it. Yeah. This is why I don't drink. Oh. Hey. How you doing? I'm fine. I mean, I'm not listening to you guys fornicate all night long. Thrusting and pumping. Okay. I thought your hip popped out at one point. I'm just saying, it's, like, all fun and games, and then you wake up in bed next to a 40-year-old freshman. I'm 19, so... Nineteen minutes late to pinochle, where you're meeting your old friends in the park? Yeah, that's what I meant. Oh, my gosh, Maya, look at him. He's still so sharp. That's so inspiring. Tell us about the war, any one of them. You're, like, the loudest climaxer I've ever heard. It was, like, the sound of, like, a 30-year-old sprinkler finally going off for the first time. Okay, well, so lovely talking with you. SIGHS You're a lovely person. Hmm. Nice to meet you. DOOR OPENS WHISPERING Oh, my God. She seems nice. DOOR CLOSES She's horrible. God. She was Cynthia's roommate, and I felt bad for her, so I told her I would room with her. So... So you probably have a bunch of stuff that you have to do today. Right? No. Oh. Okay. Look, I just want you to know I'm not, like, a hit it and quit it type of fella. I'm, like, a hit it, continue to hit it both physically and emotionally kind of guy, so... Hey, Doug, you're not gonna be weird about this, are you? No. I mean, you're cool with just hooking up? Yeah. I mean, no. I mean, I'm glad you said something. 'Cause I don't even know if I like you when I'm sober. No, I know, and it's like, that doesn't even hurt, like, at all. Okay, so, um... I'm gonna... I'm gonna split. I'll text you later. Great, that was great sex. You're good at it. And I'll text you, three to five minutes or something? DOOR OPENS All right.   what the fuck is this? This is bullshit. Are you two fucking around at school again? Hey, we got to pay for this shit. We need results! No, no, no. Look, we are looking aggressively for this very specific tattoo. Or the tattoo could just be a dead end. What the fuck? It's the same case! Do the same thing. Well, it's not exactly the same case, 'cause one of us got laid last night. Schmidt? Shh. Don't wake up my dick. Flew in on the red-eye, hasn't gotten a wink of sleep. Damn. We're talking missionary. We're talking missionary. We're talking when I'm on top and she's on her back. She's smart, she's an art major. She can't be that smart. She's a fucking art major. Come on. I will give you some daps, Schmidt. Give me some motherfucking daps, man! Come on, give me some. Give me some. Come on! JENKO: My human sexuality class is blowing my mind. Did you know I used gay slurs in high school? Yes, directed at me. Dude, I am so sorry for being a homophone. Are we gonna talk about how weird you were today with Dickson? Look, I don't think the tattoo means what you think it means. I mean, for all we know, a lot of people could have that tattoo. This tattoo? This absurdly specific tattoo? Name one other person who has this. For starters, Zook has it. Zook has the tattoo? What the fuck? We've been looking for this tattoo for days! Do you understand this means Zook is the dealer? I really want you guys to hang out. We have hung out. He's completely ignored me. I'm sorry, but we're gonna have to investigate your new bff. We're gonna put cameras everywhere, and we're gonna monitor the fuck out of what he's doing. We can't just walk into zeta house and just put up a bunch of fucking cameras, okay? There's dudes there everywhere. All right, your plan is stupid. I'm sorry. My plan is stupid? That's interesting. What... okay. I'm, like, basically done fucking watching your shit all the fucking time. Okay, yeah, exactly. I'm the fucking stupid one. Yeah. Oh, that's really fucking stupid. Man, it must be hard being so different. We're exactly the same. It makes everything so much easier. Guys, can you just give us some space? We're really trying to figure something out, and we need to focus, okay? You're not gonna have trouble focusing, man. Yeah, man, those krispie treats got mad whyphy in them. KENNY: We made a batch for the whole dorm, man. I've eaten six of these. KENNY: Then you're gonna be real focused. KEITH: Be real focused. In about four hours, you're gonna be tripping. You're fine. You're gonna be all right, man. Who sold you whyphy? Nobody sold it to us. Yeah, man, Cynthia gave us a butt load, and in exchange, we wrote her logic paper for her. All right. All right, man, we'll see you guys later. Enjoy the food. Maybe this is a good thing. DOOR CLOSES let's use that focus to figure out a way to get into zook's house. You feel anything? No. Do you feel anything? No, but I have a super high tolerance for... PANTING I'm so focused. I'm so focused, too. You don't have to be on top of me. Yes, I do. Why? Camouflage. Go. CANS CLATTERING Let's go. MALE STUDENT: No fucking way. Okay, so no? Dane? All right. Out, all right. Bull's-eye. Bingo. That helmet looks kind of lame. You know what's not lame? Safety. WHIRRING What are you doing? I'm cutting glass. It's a laser pointer. It can't cut glass. What? That's no fun at all. I'm so focused. Let's do this. I'm so focused. Let's do this. WHIRRING Give me another. I don't have any more cameras. You don't need to drill so many holes. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that one's perfect. Okay, you can do that one. I don't have any more cameras. I've said it five times. All right. Okay. That's the last of 'em. BEEPING Time to prove that zook's the dealer. JENKO: Or not the dealer. Next up is Brad mcquaid. ALL AGREEING Right? Yes. Yes! Obviously, right? I mean, the guy's... The guy's all-time. You guys, let's be honest. I mean, like, he was opening up beer cans with his eyeballs. That's so sweet of them. So Brad... Brad's in. Uh, Doug mcquaid. No! He's a bag of dicks! He's Brad's brother. He follows him around everywhere, so I doubt we get Brad without Doug. That's not true. I have a serious girlfriend. I got a bad feeling about this guy, dude. Why? Why? I was talking to him for a second. He's got a big mouth, okay? I feel like he could fuck this whole thing up for us. See, you're fucking this up. You talk way too much. That guy is harmless, dude. Look at him, he's nice. ROOSTER: He looks like a 30-year-old eighth grader. ZOOK: He's gonna be fine. I'm just saying, the kid sucks. Okay, and Brad. Brad could be, like, our guy. He could, like, be a part of our thing. Our thing? Yeah. Shh. I'm trying to hear them be nice about me. This is fucking bullshit. Shit! Shit. Is somebody up there? Shit. We got to get out of here. Did you lock the door? I did, man. I checked twice. Go, go! I'm so focused, dude. Shit. No, you're just paranoid because we're about to trip balls. No, I'm paranoid because it could be dangerous. No, we're fine. Look, we made it. We made it. It's all good. SCHMIDT: Oh, shit! SCREAMING Help! Help! What's happening! JENKO: What the fuck? JENKO: PANTING I can't breathe. They made us! They're gonna kill us! Jenko! Where are you going? Oh, fuck! I'm having a bad trip! We're having a bad trip! I think we are tripping, but... God, isn't this great? My side's so much scarier than yours. Oh, shit, your trip sucks. You should come over here. It's way better. Okay. THUD GROANS It's some kind of weird split screen! LAUGHING Hello, football. Jenko! Jenko! I finally got my lambo! Hey, Schmidt, look! Look! Look! LAUGHING THUNDER RUMBLING DANCE MUSIC PLAYING SOMBER ROCK BALLAD PLAYING My legs are tired. Help! No more music! You'll always be alone. SCREAMS Hey, jenko. What? Where are you going? I'm just gonna go up for a little while, okay? Stay, stay here. No, I don't want to stay here. I'm flying. This is amazing. No. God. Don't go! Oh, my God. No! Stay here! No, no, stop it. You're dragging me down! Why would you drag me down? Please stay! I'm flying. Stay! BOTH SCREAMING Wake up! Get out of the car! Shit. Get out of the car! Get on the ground! On your fucking knees! Get on your knees! You already know, don't you? What? Do you have anything to say? Please don't kill us. If you don't have anything to fucking say, open your fucking mouth. What the fuck? Is that vodka? Welcome to zeta, pledges! LAUGHING Yeah, buddy! Pledges, tonight, we separate the weak from the strong. If you don't make it through tonight, you're dead to all of us. Rooster, light the torch! For zeta! ALL CHEERING ALL: CHANTING Drink, motherfucker! Drink, motherfucker! Drink, motherfucker! Drink, motherfucker! Look, whatever happens tonight, you have to keep up, okay? I'm gonna throw up. I know. Shut up. Go. ZOOK: Ready? Go! Here we go, here we go. One, two, three, four, five... I can't do it anymore!

You said you wanted to stick together. This is what we have to do to win their trust. This is supposed to be fun. It's just drinking and bonding games. It's fun. It's fun for you. It's not fun for me. I don't know. Maybe we should just... Maybe we should just investigate different people. Did you really just say that? Did you really just say that you want to investigate other people? That's what you want? I don't know, maybe. Maybe we should just... We should just branch out. Okay, just sow our oats a little. Sow our cop oats. Look, I have an in with Zook. We have a thing and it's good, and... I don't know, maybe I should just stay closer to him. And you should do your thing with your connections and channels with Cynthia's roommate. You should see if she knows who sold her drugs. I just... I just don't... I don't like the idea of us doing stuff separately. No, look, we can still investigate together. It's just, you know, now it'll be an open thing. You want an open investigation? I don't know if that's what I want. All right? I just think it's healthy right now for us to try it. Okay. Yeah? Sure. Okay, so I guess I'll just catch you later, then. You okay? No, you can't hug me right now. Do you need money for a cab or anything? No, I don't need money for a cab. Okay. I don't know where the fuck I am right now. Hey, Lauren. I just want to get in bed and watch friends all day. ANNOUNCER: Let's hear it for your metropolitan city state statesmen!

BOB: Looks pretty old to be a freshman. It's the hormones in the milk, Bob. Ready? Set, hut! BOB: Haythe drops back. And connects with mcquaid! GRUNTS Who beats safety will glock like an egg white in my famous meringue recipe. Holy shit, he's good. None of you tell mcquaid that he's good, all right? If you do, he'll leave this shitty program. BOB: And as the clock ticks down, we've got time for one last play. Another perfect hookup between haythe and mcquaid. JIM: Even their end zone celebration is in perfect sync. It's like these two share a single brain, Bob. That's right, Jim. They both have one half a brain. And the crowd rushes the field to try and knock down a goalpost. It's not coming down! ALL CHEERING BOB: CHUCKLING Good luck, guys. JIM: Looks like mc state's got a new power couple. Zook and mcquaid! I got to get around you, man. I can't jump up. I got a broken ankle. BOTH GRUNTING Yeah! BOTH: Fuck yes! Yeah! One more! CELL PHONE BUZZING Shit. SIGHS Who is that? Nothing.

How did you two meet? Oh, I love meet-cute stories. We met at a poetry slam, and then he stalked me back to my dorm room. Stalked her? Oh, that's so beautiful. Then what happened? And then we hung out and we watched a movie. Actually, we watched it a couple times. This is bullshit! This fucking... waiter! What can a black man do to get some water around here? Give the fucking guy some water! He's black! He's been through a lot! For the sake of your daughter, please keep it together. I'm gonna need a motherfucking crepe before I go crazy.

No, nothing. All right, with everything that happened with Cynthia and whyphy, I just don't want you to screw up. You don't think I know what I'm doing? What? I know exactly what I'm doing here. I'm gonna tell you something, all right? Can I trust you? Yeah, of course. I have a friend who knows a guy at umc. He's a scout. It's d-I. Their qb, he's not playing well. They're not happy with the situation. They want me to make a tape. And I want you to be on it with me. STAMMERING Nothing else? They had five guys in the draft last year. I mean, Brad, this could be our shot. We're like the dynamic duo, bro. We're like Batman and Robin. But we're both Batman. What do you want to be, like, a stockbroker? Or a cop? Dude, your ceiling is, like, so high. You can just bust right... Just break right through it. Right through it. Right through it. Right through it. You really think I could make it at umc? Dude, you could make it into the hall of fame. No, dude, come on, that's you. You're gonna be in, like, the anals of football history. Dude, you could make it into the anals of football history, too. We're gonna have to tear those anals up. All right. We're gonna fucking tear it up. I mean, it's just a tape, right? I fucking hate my dad so much. Do you have any idea what it's like to have a guy like that telling you what to do all the time? CELL PHONE CHIMING I can only imagine. I just don't understand what his problem is with you specifically. SIGHS I don't... Jesus. That makes no sense to me. I mean, you are a perfectly good guy. You're very honest and nice. Why does my dad have your phone number? I don't know. Maybe the school directory or something. Let's do something... Let's do something that would distract us. Okay. So we don't have to think about him anymore. Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. All right. Um... CLEARS THROAT Maya. Is it okay if we just talk? Okay. Let's talk. No way. Yeah. I was Peter Pan, but then I was, like, late. You're really close with your brother, then. It seems like. Yeah. Yeah, you know... LAUGHING You're a fucking genius, dude.

Yeah, I'm so sorry, this... CHUCKLES I'll see you. I'll see you later. Okay. Best night ever. Okay. Bye. Bye. CLEARS THROAT How long have you been there? Like, the longest amount of time you could think of right now. This stuff wasn't meant for you. It was meant to be private. So, am I supposed to just sit here and not act like I hear every one of your problems? You got problems, but being young isn't one. You're just jealous because Maya and I have a real connection. I'm pretty close with my grandpa, too. You're more messed up than Cynthia was, and she went to the school shrink three times a week. Why? I don't know. But he gave her a ton of pills and shit. Maybe he could give you something for your weird old face. Okay. Hey. You're late. No, actually, I was busy with the investigation. This is Cynthia's therapist's office. This is our investigation. WHISPERING All right. Watch the door. Oh, is that all I'm good for? Just watching a fucking door? CELL PHONE VIBRATING Got it. Patient exhibits drug-induced paranoia. Believes her life is in danger. Uh, door, door. Hey. I wasn't told that I had a 9:00 A.M. session. Yeah, no, we're your 9:00 A.M. that's us. And we're cured. Thank you very much. You're an amazing doctor. Please. You think you're the first partners only to try to run when you're first faced with talking with me? How the fuck did you know we were partners? He doesn't know we're partners. WHISPERING I suspect you're partners. A relationship is something that requires constant work. Which is what I thought we learned in high school. So you are high school sweethearts. I picked up on that early. Please, continue the dialogue. Doc. I just feel like sometimes he's not even trying anymore. Like this isn't even worth saving. JENKO: Oh, okay. Well, sometimes I feel like that we should be more like the yangs. Or maybe I should be more like your beautiful zook. Oh, go fuck yourself! You go fuck yourself. Okay. You're so selfish. All right. That's a lot of fucking. Oh, my God. Sometimes I like to have the participants make physical contact. Why don't you hold hands? Okay. I'm not doing that. Hmm? Do you see? Reach out your hand. I'm... He's literally reaching out for you. He won't hold my hand. JENKO: I'm not doing it. I kind of need you to do it. He won't hold my hand. Oh, you... You got to interlock it, though. If you don't interlock it, it's not hand-holding. Fine. We might as well just be friends and not partners. Nice, right? Okay, you see this? This is strong. What I want to be able to have is this. Is this... I want to be able to have that, that same thing, in, like without actually having to do it. Are you embarrassed of your partner? No, not at all. Okay? And why the fuck are you guys ganging up on me? Gang up on him. Okay, seriously. Okay, okay. He's clingy. He literally is terrified of being by himself. Look, I know zook's your buddy and you don't want him to be guilty, but he's our guy. No, he's actually not our guy. I would know. Now, you know, we sometimes cling to things because they're familiar and comfortable. I teach about a principle called embedding. Look at the facts. Matter of fact, I... Zook has the tattoo. He knew Cynthia. I know the first time he met you, you dropped a fucking sandwich on his foot and he smiled at you, but you are completely blind to the fact... What'd you say embedding was? Embedding? Oh, embedding is our tendency to latch on to the first bit of information that we're offered and overlooking, or even ignoring, contradictory information. It's a fascinating principle... Shut up. I'm thinking. You think it's possible that we embedded? What, like when we were drunk or something? We embedded each other? Okay. I'm gonna recommend... Okay, you can leave the room. Just get the fuck out. Get the fuck out. You heard him. This took a turn. One, two... Okay. Yep. Good session. DOOR CLOSES The first time we saw the photo of Cynthia buying whyphy, dickson said, this guy's the dealer. Everything we've done and thought has been based on that fact, but what if dickson was wrong? And we've ignored all the other clues. SCHMIDT: What if Cynthia wasn't the buyer? What if Cynthia was the dealer? Captain, we have something really, really important to tell you about. VELCRO RIPPING Captain? Are you wearing kevlar? Now, gentlemen, we're not gonna sit here and pretend there's not a big-ass elephant in the room. What the fuck is going on? This is what the fuck is going on. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY Oh, shit! No! That is not happening right now! No! Hey, y'all, he's fucking the captain's daughter! Yo! Every time he say that shit... JENKO: Oh, my fuck! ...that's another foot in your ass. Schmidt, you clearly... Yo, this is the best thing ever! LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY Schmidt fucked the captain's daughter! SINGSONG Schmidt fucked the captain's daughter! Schmidt fucked the captain's daughter! Shit! Fuck! You fucked captain dickson's daughter? Captain, what the... You bragged to him to his face. To his actual face. Captain... Do you understand that this face right here, you bragged to that face? You actually high-fived schmidt for fucking your daughter. Holy shit! Oh, my God! This is... It's really not that funny. SCHMIDT: I just want to say that it was bizarre not to share the fact that your daughter went to mc state. I think it's bizarre that I haven't cut your motherfucking nuts off. What if captain gets to punch you in the face one time, really, really, really hard? Nah. I got something way better than that. SCREAMS ALL EXCLAIMING You think Cynthia was the dealer? How the fuck we gonna infiltrate the dealer if the dealer is dead? We have to stop treating this like it's exactly the same as last time. And we got a bigger problem. No more money in the budget. What? I thought we had Cate blanchett. Cate blanchett? Yeah, I thought we had Cate blanchett with the budget. You mean carte blanche. That one. Welcome back, dum-dum. We did have carte blanche. Not no more. You got that expensive chase in the beginning, that expensive equipment, this fucking office... This look like some shit iron man would have. Shit's expensive! I got on 800 shoes, and you can't even see the motherfuckers. So now you two motherfuckers is in the crosshairs. I'm warning you, find the supplier, but don't cost the department no more money. Look, I apologize about the zook thing. You were right, he's not the dealer. Okay, great. You apologized. What's that worth, man? Now we have no leads. What are we supposed to do now? Police work. Fuck. EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST Don't throw a fucking dead person's dildo at me. We're at work right now, okay? JENKO: Kids don't check out books anymore, right? I don't even think they know how to read. Library. Book place. Library. The supplier is putting drugs inside the books in the library, where literally no one goes anymore, man. And the dealers check out the books. We're going to catch the supplier. CELL PHONE VIBRATING Do you realize how cool... Wait, one sec, one sec. What's up, dude? Hey, dude, where are you? We're warming up. The game's about to start. All right, man. Um, look, I'm just gonna... I'm coming. All right, later. What are you doing? Don't leave me hanging. Dude, I got to go or I'm gonna blow my cover, okay? You can do this alone. I'll be back in two hours. You got this. CROWD CHEERING SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY You scared me. ZOOK: State name! Number! State name! Number! Color! Color! Number! MAN: This is the place. You'd think if somebody wants to show us their operation, they'd at least be on time. Look at this crap. Huh? I do miss the days... Shit. What's he doing here? ...When people did normal drugs. What is this? Jelly beans? Crap! Set, hut! BOB: Mcquaid crosses in an end-around. It's a trick play! These two are practically interchangeable. Mcquaid throws down the field to haythe. And he hangs on for the touchdown! JIM: These two are peas in a pod, Bob, but instead of little green balls, they are human football players. ANNOUNCER: Let's hear it once again, mc state, for your dynamic duo. CROWD CHEERING Oh, shit. My brother needs me again. Look, you know, loyalty's cool, and I admire it, and I know he's your brother. But you can't allow yourself to be held down by a guy just because he won't let go. JENKO: Yeah. Um... I gotta take a piss. MAN: The kid's pretty rude to make us wait like this. Can you shut it? What's wrong with those classic drugs from the '90s? Heroin, you know, cocaine... Hey, hey. Whoa. Shit. I'm fucking here. You happy? Shh! The ghost is right there, okay? He's about to meet up with the supplier. Hey. Check that out. JENKO: You shush. You're the one fucking talking. You're being so fucking loud. You shut the fuck up. What's going on here? SCHMIDT: Shit! Um... STUTTERING You're interrupting a really stellar blow job. Oh, fuck, I just came so hard! What the hell is going on? It's okay. It's just a couple of faggots. Hey, yo, what the fuck did you just say? Did you just call us faggots? He said you were sucking his dick. It's 2014, asshole. You can't fucking use faggot. Gay is okay. Homosexual, maybe. And if you know the person, you might be able to call them a queer. If they have a great sense of humor, but I don't. I'm sorry, he took one human sexuality class, he thinks he's Harvey milk. Oh, my God. Will you please, just for once, just back me up? Why can't you just use your head for once? Oh. You want me to use my head? Fine. Oh, yeah, what's up now, motherfuckers? You remember me?

Stairs are so much faster. TIRES SCREECHING That's the car you got? I'm sorry it's not a fucking lambo. Shut up and get in. Are they even still chasing us? Yes, they're still chasing us! Why did you do that? We were about to catch the supplier. What's wrong with you? Look, if you don't say something, people will never stop discriminating. Will you please do something about how slow this thing's going? SCREAMS Oh, shit! Watch out, watch out! That is just like a little helmet machine. BOTH SCREAMING We can't destroy any more stuff! We can't waste any more of the department's money! Watch out for that cash machine! ALL: Whoo! Which way? Which way? Which way? SCHMIDT: Whichever way's cheaper! Right? You went right? You could've gone in a parking lot, you went to the sculpture garden? Do you know how expensive that's gonna be? Shit! It's like they're trying to hit 'em or something. I mean, it looks cool, but, I mean, it's just so wasteful. SCHMIDT: They're destroying everything! Captain's gonna kill us! TIRES SCREECHING What are we gonna do? All right, we're gonna lose 'em in the robotics lab. What? CLATTERING SCHMIDT: Oh, no! Oh, we broke everything! There was a lot of expensive stuff in there! Oh, shit! They're going into the stadium! Listen, schmidt, I gotta tell you something. I got offered a scholarship to play football here next year. And zook said I could room with him, you know, so I was thinking that I could do that, maybe. What? You can't be a cop and stay here and play football with zook. No, look, I know, okay? It's just... There's no friction with me and zook. We're the same. Do you want out? If you want out, just say it. No, I don't want out, okay? It's just, when I'm on the football field and I'm diving for a pass, I feel like I can fly. All right? And when I'm with you, it just feels like you hold me down. I just wish you could fly with me. BOB: And the statesmen win, 34-14. ALL CHEERING JIM: And there go the fans onto the field.

Are we waiting on anybody or you dining alone? Someone may swing by, but we can... We can order without them. We have identified and arrested one Dr. Karl Murphy, who was found with whyphy residue throughout his office... ...and had a close personal relationship with the deceased. Exactly like a case we had recently at a high school. Exactly the same. The case is closed. You know, like, what you're gonna do after you're out of here? You're not supposed to throw rocks. What? You're not supposed to throw rocks. GROANS  I ain't missing you at all  since you've been gone away the lobster for one person. Enough for one person only.

Hey. What are you doing here? Just came to see how you are. I'm doing fucking great. I'm the happiest I've ever been, so I'm just having a great time with myself. I'm glad you're having a good time with yourself. I'm a solo artist now, like Beyonce. I used to have the other destiny's children, but now I'm just, uh, a lone superstar. Happy for you. Just a light-skinned princess with a dream and an amazing voice. That's great. How are you? I'm pretty great. I just chill and... You know how chill zook is. Zook's such a chill guy. Just like ice. That makes me so happy for you. So, look, I just wanted to say that, like, I was thinking about the case, and I was worried that they got the wrong guy for it. I don't think he's the guy, either. Yeah? I looked into the ghost's background, and I saw that he pays tuition for a student at mc state. You think the ghost could be the supplier's dad? Maybe. Okay, that's a pretty good piece of information. Thank you. Well, I heard whyphy's coming back in a big way. Someone's bringing a shit-ton of that stuff down to puerto, Mexico, for spring break. And if that happens, whyphy is going viral. It's gonna be at every college in the country. I think my information was stronger. Look, if you... If you want to, we could go down there. Like together? We don't have to put a label on it. Just, like, one-time. One-time thing. No big commitment or stress to each other. What about school and football and your wonderful new life? I have time off. I'm on spring break.   SIGHS Cool tingling. Got room for one of these babies. A grenade. Why you gonna put it there? That's just unsanitary. Feels right. Missed a spot.

MERCEDES: Okay, so here's the plan. We're gonna get all these kids at spring break hooked on whyphy. Then you're gonna bring it back to your turf, and you're gonna sell the shit out of it. Sell shit out of it. Do you see that? And if you rat me out, I framed my psych prof just for giving me a b-minus. He's in jail now, so don't fuck with me. We're gonna build a nationwide network. What? What the fuck are you doing? Be quiet. Why don't you sell those old classic drugs from the '90s, like cocaine, heroin and... Dad, those are, like, old-people drugs. That's, like, what they did on the golden girls. Like, blanche did heroin. All right, I'll just sit here and be silent. Blanche never did heroin. Okay, so, yangs, you'll take my dead roommate's spot. Cool. Dope. Are you kidding me, yangs? Are you fucking high? Of course. Yeah, I am. Jesus Christ, have you ever heard of, don't get high on your own supply? We didn't. Nah. I didn't do that.

We have way more guns than you. Drop your fucking guns. Okay, that's a good point. Wow. LAUGHS I mean, was this really your entire plan? Coming in here with no backup? Or maybe we had a far more elaborate plan. Mmm-hmm. Maybe my partner has a tracking device in his pocket right now. May... what? You had the fucking tracking device. I don't have it. That's the one fucking thing you were supposed to remember. JENKO: You're the smart person. You do the tracking device shit. That's your domain. I do the physical shit. SCHMIDT: You know what, I may drag you down sometimes, but every possible time you can do something dumb, you do the dumbest possible thing. No, the fucking dumbest possible thing is letting two cops blah-blah-blah while other cops are getting in position to bust their shit in. Oh, so you mean I brought the tracking device. Yeah. What's up now, huh? That seemed like such a real argument. That's improv, bitch. Move! Spring break yourself, fool. We shoot dicks off here in jump street. We're here, as well.

We'd have to be out of our minds to trade places with any of 'em. ...and I have four sources saying that it is. And what did he say? He said, ""Jeannette walls, ""you are nothing but a bottom-feeder ""with a silly little gossip column. ""If you print this story, ""i will have my lawyers crawl so far up your ass ""that you will taste their ink in your mouth."" Oh, my gosh! What did you say? I thanked him for the perfect kicker quote and hung up the phone. The whole office gave her a standing ovation. And you ran it? Oh, heck, yeah, I ran it. Where I come from, you never miss an opportunity to serve a bully a slice of humble pie. Could you box this up for me? And maybe yours, too, if you're not gonna eat it? Yeah. She's just kidding. No, I'm not. I never joke about food. So, where are you from, miss walls? I think I detect a slight twang in there somewhere. Jeannette grew up in Virginia surrounded by trees and fields of wild flowers. If we could all be so lucky. Mmm. I own a mining company near Richmond. Your folks still there? Ah, yep, they are. They have a little house there on a hill overlooking a river and they love it, yeah. And what do they do? My mom is an artist. My dad, um, is an engineer. He's developing a technology that'll burn low-grade bituminous coal more efficiently. Wow. You have him give me a call when he has that figured out. I sure will. And what do they think of you hitching up with this big city boy? Well, I haven't told them yet. Well, Tiffany still hasn't told her parents about me, and we've been together over a year. Well, you better hurry up. Who knows how much time he's got left? That was unbelievable. I can't believe he gave you the account on the spot. I know. This is huge for the firm. I'm taking you with me to all of these from now on. I'm gonna be home soon. I just wanna have everything ready for him to sign in the morning. All right. Hey, when it comes to my family, let me do the lying. Okay? You got it. Hey, don't forget your leftovers. See you at home. Love you. Bye. You in a hurry? Come on, man! You need to get out of the street. Hey! Hello? Hey, Lori. Hey, Jeannette. What's goin' on? I just saw mom and dad diggin' through the trash downtown. Did mom find any new treasures? I didn't stop. What? Why not? I don't know. Are you okay? Jeannette... Mom, are we gonna have any lunch? Go outside and play with Brian and Lori. But I'm hungry. Would you rather me make you some food that'll be gone in an hour, or finish this painting that'll last forever? Go on. You know how to do it. How many do you want, mom? Two, please! Rex! Jeannette, can you tell miss Kelly why you were cooking hot dogs all by yourself? I cook all the time. You know, the address that your parents gave us doesn't seem to be right. Where do you live? All over. Dad says our home goes wherever we go. And where do you go to school? That's how gray wolves call for their family. Mountain goat, where the hell are you? I'm in here! Oh, sorry, doc, just havin' a little fun gettin' those healing endorphins goin'. Mr. walls, I'm doctor Taylor. No offense, you got a lot of sick on that hand. Uh, this here is miss Kelly. She's our resident social worker. These guys treatin' you okay? There's so much food here. You can eat as much as you want. Maybe I should break my arm. Me, too. What happened here? He fell off the couch and cracked his head open on the floor. He's fine. There was blood everywhere. You should check him in. One kid in the hospital at a time is enough. Besides, Brian's head is so hard, I think the floor took more damage than he did. Mr. walls, I don't find any of this very funny. Any of what, doc? These children need proper care, and you're making a joke of it. - Rex... - Dad! A veteran of the U.S. air force brings his little girl in here so you can wrap her in a band-aid and hand him a bill for more than a pilot makes in a year. Now, my family won't eat for three months so that you can drive a Cadillac. You're part of a system that is gettin' rich off of the human need to survive, doc. You call that ""proper care""? Mr. walls, can we have a moment, please? Dad's in trouble, mountain goat. We'll be back. Come on, kids, time to go. Okay. In order to pull this off, every fiber in your being has got to believe that this is real. If you can convince yourself, then you can convince them, too. You got it? Good. Let's see that poker face. Regular face. Poker. Regular. Poker. Regular. Poker. Regular. Poker. Incredible. Let's go. Mornin', sunshine. You ready to skedaddle? Ready to go! Brian, wrap it up! Bye! I've been lookin' into this new solarban glass. It lets in the light, but blocks the radiation. It will drastically reduce our energy demands. Is it still gonna have glass walls and a glass ceiling? Of course! How else we gonna see the stars at night? You think my room can have glass stairs goin' up to it? That's a great idea. Uh, baby, take the wheel. Structurally, we could make that work if it was a spiral with a steel stringer. That way all the weight pushes in toward the middle. Just don't let it block any light to my studio. I need full exposure. Oh, I like full exposure from you, dear. You really think we'll build it? Of course. When? You know, this running around is only temporary. We just need the perfect location, and then we can get to work on our castle. - Okay, now who needs a book? - Me! Me! You can drive. Here's a new Zane grey adventure. And, oh, look... You'll love this one, Jeannette. Black beauty. It's like uncle tom's cabin but for horses. Doctor Taylor said stayin' home and reading books on our own isn't a well-rounded education. Mmm. Really? He said we should be goin' to a real school. A real school, huh? He's gonna kill us! Everyone out! Come on! Look at this! All those Juniper and Joshua trees have adapted to survive on only five inches of rainfall a year. That inselberg was formed from cooling magma over a hundred million years ago. Pretty soon the sun's comin' down, we'll be watchin' Orion and aquarius and horologium rotate through the night sky. This is as real as it gets, kids! And don't let no dumb-ass doctor tell you different. You learn from living! Everything else is a damn lie. Oh! Look at that! What is it, baby? That is the most beautiful tree I have ever seen! Someone get my canvas! Looks like we'll be sleepin' here tonight, kids. This is actually great for your posture. You know, the Indians never use pillows either, and look how straight they stand. Why that one? The wind's been beatin' that tree down since the day it was born. But it refuses to fall. It's the struggle that gives it its beauty. Dad. Dad? Huh? I think maybe I saw something out there. All right. Did you get a good look at it? Not really. Was he a big ol' hairy son of a bitch with the damndest lookin' teeth and claws? Maybe. Mmm-hmm. And, uh, did it have pointy ears and evil eyes with fire in 'em? You've seen him, too? Oh, yeah, yeah. I been chasin' that demon for years. Where'd you see him? Ow! We gotta get that off you. It's okay. Fire can't get you here. We're just gonna let this wound breathe a little. Yeah? Now, I want you to just hold this puppy right there. You see the top of the flames where the yellow dissolves into the heat? That zone is known in physics as the boundary between turbulence and order. It's a place where no rules apply. Or at least they haven't figured 'em out yet. That's all life is, bunch of molecules bouncin' off each other at random. So there's no point in tryin' to find a reason or pattern for why you were born at a certain time and why you got bit by that fire. You just got a little too close to the chaos is all. You understand? I'm not sure I do either. There. How's that feel? Jeannette? Yeah? I've got a surprise for you in here. Okay! You... you said it was fun. No. I said it was funny. Okay, well... And it's very overpriced. It's Italian, that's why. Just sit down in it. Enjoy the chair for a second. Just wiggle around in it a little bit. You're not wiggling... There you go. I'll take it back. That's fine. No, no, it's fine. Don't worry about it. I'll take the chair back. It's not about the chair. I... I'm gettin' lunch with my mom today. I didn't tell you 'cause i didn't want you to worry. Are you gonna tell her about us? I'm gonna have to tell her at some point. Okay. Okay. Just please try to not let her dump her crap on you this time. That's what parents are for. Can you just try, though? Of course I'll try. Thank you. Mom... Yeah, your dad said he saw you pass by in a cab the other night. Acted like we weren't even there. You shouldn't be ashamed of us just 'cause we choose a different lifestyle than you. Being homeless in New York City does not count as a lifestyle choice. Well, if we heard from you more, you'd know that we found a lovely place on the lower east side. Lori says you're squatting in an abandoned building. That does not sound safe, mom. When did you lose your sense of adventure? I have a little bit of money now. I can help you if you want. Mmm-mmm-mmm. We're fine. You're the one who needs help. Look at you. Your values are all confused. Mmm. So what did you want to talk about? I'm gettin' married. To the accountant? David is a financial analyst. Well, I... I don't mean to be rude, but isn't he a little... Mom, David is good for me. You mean he's got money. I mean I'm in love with him. Hmm. Can I see that again? Hmm. Well... I just hope you've got a good plan for telling your dad, because this is gonna kill him. Shh, it's okay. I'm right here. Everything's gonna be okay, Maureen. I'm gonna take care of you. Let's go, kids! Time to pull up stakes and leave this hell-hole behind! - What's going on? - Feds are on our tail! Really? He means the bill collectors. Truck leaves in minutes! Now, there's not enough room in the cab, so you guys are in for a real treat. You get to ride in the back. What? Hey, it's not an ideal scenario for anyone, so we'll just try to make the best of it. It'll be kinda like that rotor ride at the fair. Except without any lights or oxygen. Oh, don't be so dramatic. It'll be an adventure. Be careful. There you go. Okay, scoot back. How long do we have to be back here? Don't worry. This'll be the last time you have to do this. Welcome to the oldest mining town in Utah. I thought that was the last town. Me, too. That one was the oldest in Nevada. People been strikin' it rich here for a hundred years. They must've all moved somewhere else to spend their fortune. Has a real frontier quality to it. Think we might be able to stay here for a while? Hmm, I got a good feelin' about this one. I got it. The kids are tired of movin' to a new town every time you lose a job. They'd love it in West Virginia. I just think it'd be good for them to see where their daddy grew up. Mountain goat, let go! Try floatin' a little! We're fine where we are. Taking showers at the public pool? I'll get the water turned on this weekend. You said that two months ago. Okay, Brian, don't be shy. Everyone here is the same as us. They just got different complexions. Go on. Go play. If we went, your parents could help us out with some money. I ain't moving back to Welch. What are you so afraid of? I ain't afraid o' nothin'. Hey! Quit clingin' to the side! Don't be scared. I got ya. Come on. Yeah. Kick your legs. That's not so hard. It's all about movin' the water. Yeah? Move your arms, go ahead. Move 'em in the water. Push the water, push it. Push it with your arms. That's good. It's not so bad, is it? Good. 'Cause you're gonna learn to swim today. Catch your breath. Catch your breath. All right. Okay, all right. Breathe. Nice. Why'd you do that? Okay. Okay. Now, sink or swim! Rex! It's okay! She's already gettin' it! Pretty soon she's gonna be doin' the backstroke, right? No. Yeah? Okay. I wanna go back. You did it, baby! You were swimmin'! Hey! Mountain goat! Mister, you're wrong for that! Come on, kids. Let's go. Stop, no! Hey! Hey! Don't touch me! You tried to kill me! Hey. I would never let anything bad happen to you. But I can't let you cling to the side your whole life just 'cause you're scared. If you don't wanna sink, you have to learn how to swim. Understand? Hey, you were swimmin'. You were swimmin'. I'm so proud of you. Hey! Everything okay? She's fine. Mind your own damn business. What happens in my pool is my business. Oh, so this is your pool? As far as you're concerned, yeah. Oh, so you're the one who limits the black families to an hour in the mornin', so that the whites can swim the rest of the day? That's been a federal offense since '64. Does he always act like this? Or just when he's drunk? Dad, don't! Rex! I can't let you talk to me like that in front of my daughter! Let go! Now tap out! Was that a tap? I couldn't tell. Was that a tap? Rex! Will you stop! Come on, man! You're goin' to jail, asshole! Get in the car. We're leaving with or without you. I'd rather be in hell with my back broke than live in that godforsaken town. Yeah, you should've thought of that before you got every policeman in town looking for us. I'm not gonna let 'em take our kids away. We cannot live like this anymore. Like what? This is freedom! Freedom? You call this freedom? Here we go. Welch is gonna be fun. We'll live in the mountains with the squirrels and the chipmunks. And you'll get to meet your grandma and grandpa walls, who are genuine hillbillies. We don't need him. Rex! Come on, dad! You're the head of this family! Are you coming? Negative. Mountain goat, you know, your mama has convinced you that we need to go because she's in a state of fear. Now, what you need to do is stand your ground. You see, that's what I'm doin'. This is a very important lesson for you. You don't look like a very important lesson to me. Come on. Can I hold your ankle? No. Just for stability? I feel like I'm about to fall. You're on the ground already! All right, let's do it! I got him! He's alive! Oh, thank god! Oh, watch out! Don't squish Maureen! Move over, baby. I'm driving. Come here, give me some sugar. Oh, Rex... Jeannette? Can I have another tissue, please? Oh, jeez. David! I need another tissue. You're sweating through your shirt! Please don't point it out. You know when you point it out, it only makes me sweat more. I'm sorry. You have nothing to be nervous about. Your dad already hates me. When he finds out we're getting married, he's gonna throw me through a window. Hey, he's not gonna do that. He might kick you in the stomach, though. It's too real to be funny. I'm just not there yet. Okay. He's gonna try to make me get drunk with him again. No, he's not. You know he is. David, just tell him that you don't want it. Maybe... maybe I will do that. You know, I'm not to be bullied by him. I know you're not. I will not be bullied. Hey... We're getting married. We are getting married. We can get through this. This is nothin'. Okay. Hey, dad! Oh, come on. Hey, dad. Oh, so you're acknowledgin' my existence now? Well, you're not exactly the easiest man to ignore. Well, I wanted to get this done before you got here. I don't know who designs this junk. Mechanics are all wrong. Look at you. Fancier every time I see ya. Good to see you, Mr. walls. How are you? Did you win that wet t-shirt contest? Nice nips. Cut it out. It's really hot in the car. It's the humidity. Humidity? Okay, well, just try not to drip on my marble floor. Grab that toolbox, if that's not too much for ya. Okay. Just finished hookin' every squat in the building to an insulated cable that I hot-wired off the utility pole down the block. Now the other squatters want to make me mayor of the place! Your mama's traditional yellow door. Still gotta get hinges for this thing. This is my friend Eddie. Does he live here? Hello! Oh! There she is! Hey, sweetie. Mom. Oh! Look at that! Food! What a place! Anyone else feel like they're back in Welch? I keep thinking we're gonna see our yellow poop bucket somewhere. Their bathroom's not that far off. Maureen! She's our new roommate! Oh. I thought that you were livin' with that photographer. Hmm. That was months ago. She just broke up with rum tum tugger from cats. What? Yeah. David, you get started on this, and I'll grab you a dry shirt. I'm okay. I'm not gonna drink tonight. Take it. Yes, sir. Rose Mary, grab a shirt for Jeannette's sweaty boyfriend, will ya? So did you hear officer walls made his first arrest last week? What? Drug bust. Whoa, really? Was that scary? Well, actually, you got alopecia. Not as scary as those two. What about you? Lori spilled the beans. Lori! I'm sorry. Yeah. Uh, we are doin' it. What? Why aren't you wearing the ring? Because I haven't told dad yet. Told me what? That Brian made his first arrest. Oh, goodie. Got a son in the gestapo and a daughter who writes gossip. Never thought I'd see the day. Never thought I'd see you livin' in New York. Well, somebody's gotta keep an eye on you. Have fun. Hey, dad. Actually, I have somethin' that I wanted to tell you... So how long is this phase gonna last? What do you mean? I mean... He's a nice guy and all, but he ain't got an interesting bone in his body. No. He's got no fight. David's not a phase, dad. Which is what i wanted to talk to you about. Can you honestly tell me that you're happy right now? Yes, I am. No, you're not. But hopefully, couple more of these will loosen him up. Maybe that stick'll fall out of his ass. David, here's your drink! Welcome to Welch, everyone! Gosh, things have gone downhill a bit. But I bet there's no other artists to compete with. My career could really take off. Welcome home, son. Hey, there, Rex. Hey, pops. Thanks for lettin' me see my grandchildren before I die. This is your uncle Stanley. Hi. All right, here ya go. - Can I have more? - No. This one looks just like his daddy. Only his hair was more curly. You hated them curls, didn't you? Used to wet his hair down, stand out in the snow, see if he could freeze 'em straight. Yep, that's your daddy. Stubborn as a mule, dumb as a pigeon. Ow! Hey! Don't hit my brother, you dumb witch! Hey! Show your grandma some respect. You listen to your daddy, girl. That wasn't a good simile. Pigeons are very smart animals. Dad? What are you doing? Hey. Oh... Put in your spiral staircase. Wow. We're finally gonna build it. Really? This is why we're here. It's our chance to start over. First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna search this whole town for the perfect place to lay our foundation. We're gettin' the hell outta here. Now, it's not exactly palatial, so there's gonna be a lot of togetherness. And it's a little on the rustic side. How rustic? Welcome to little Hobart street. bucks a week, and in two years, we'll own her outright. Hard to believe one day this'll all be ours. Hey, she may not look like much, but wait till you see what I have in mind. Come on. We're gonna tear all this down and replace it with your game room, - ping pong, pool, foosball... - Trampoline? Oh, yeah, trampoline goes right over there, and then all these walls are gone, replaced with three-inch glass, glass, glass, glass. This can stay. Doesn't that look lovely? Yellow stands for happiness and creativity. This place doesn't have any running water or electricity. Ignore her. She was born without vision. Since we're on the north face of the mountain, enclosed by these two hills, we ain't gettin' much sun, so I'll have to do some serious reconfigurin' to increase the size of our solar cells. But before any of that can happen, we need a good foundation. Pick! Yes, sir. Good man. Here. Make some noise, kids. Make some noise. Once it's deep enough, i can pour the slab, and we can start framin' this damn thing. We're gonna have the nicest house in the county. You ain't just whistlin' Dixie there, little lady. You know, we got the highest property on the mountain, which means that the heat can't burn us in the summer, and the floods can't touch us in the winter. We're just glidin' right in between all those extremes. Things're gonna be different this time around. I'm hungry. Try that. It's good? What are you eating? Butter and sugar. Tastes kinda like frosting. We haven't eaten in three days. Maureen's so hungry, she's eating butter. You ate the butter? I was saving that for the bread. We have no bread! Well, I was thinking of baking some. The gas is turned off. What if it gets turned back on? Miracles happen, you know. We're hungry! Hey, watch that tone, girl! You said things were going to be different. Can't we just get some eggs? Or beans, or something? Nothing fancy. I don't see why not. What you got? What about the other one? Okay, I'll be back in an hour with a feast you can tell your children about your children's children, your children's children's children, and your children's children's children's children's children's children's... He probably just got stuck talking to someone. For ten hours? Dad? Hey, kiddo. What are you doin' up? What happened? Oh. I got into a fight with the mountain. Mountain won. Dad, that looks really bad. Yeah. That don't look good. What can I do? Don't worry about me. I'm so thoroughly pickled... I won't feel a thing. Here. Okay, go ahead. Go on. I can't do it. Sorry. It's okay. It's all right. We'll do it together. Okay? It's all right. Come here. Squeeze it together. That's it. Now, push it through. Yeah. Good. Just push it right through. Good. Oh, that's good. Brave. You are amazing. Ah... Push it right through, go on. That's it. Yeah. Oh, my god, that's beautiful! Oh, jeez! You don't have to tug quite so hard on it. It's not like tug-'o-war. Okay. One more. That's good. Wow. That's some mighty fine handiwork. I swear... There are times I think that you're the only one around who still has any faith in me. You know I'd do anything for you, right? Anything. All you got to do is ask. Do you think... You could maybe stop drinking? It's just... When you drink, you can't take care of us. Must be awfully ashamed of your ol' man. No! I just think we'd have money for food. Maybe even some extra for the glass castle. You can do it if you want. You're stronger than anyone. If you don't mind, honey... I think I'd like to just... Sit here by myself a while. Dad? For the next few days, I'm gonna be keepin' to myself upstairs. And I, uh... I need you kids to steer clear of me. Take your brother and sisters outside, do somethin' fun, okay? And no matter what happens, if I ask for a drink, you can't let anyone give me one. Not a drop. Okay? Can you do that for me? Yeah. You promise? That's a good girl. You think we could start building the house soon? Probably. Oh, please! Ah! Ah, god! Make it stop! Please make it stop! Just breathe, honey. Rose Mary! God, help me! Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Help me, please! Oh, no! Dad? Oh, my god. Please get me a drink. I'll get you some water. No, no, no. There's some whiskey under the sink. Go fetch it for me. Jeannette... I'm dyin'. If you don't get me a drink, I'm gonna die. That is a scientific fact. Understand? You don't want me to die? Do you want your daddy to die? I can't, dad. I promised you. I don't care about your stupid promise! Go get me a drink right now! You better go get me a drink! Jeannette! Foundation looks pretty good. We're almost ready to start buildin'. I missed you. I missed you, too. How 'bout that? Look. That's wonderful. Dad's leaving for work! Stop! I'll help you put your hat on. All right, make sure it ain't faulty. Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, that's fine. Oh, thanks, bill, merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Rex. Merry Christmas, ladies! You, too. The foreman forgot his toolbox, and so I had to use this macaroni noodle to insulate these crosswires, and now I got every damn person at work tellin' me that I really know how to use my noodle! I couldn't find a good one for you, so you'll just have to write your own. Careful. You might change the world with that thing. Hmm? It's so pretty. Mmm, beautiful. Rich city folk live in fancy apartments, but their air is so polluted, they can't even see the stars. We'd have to be out of our minds to trade places with any of 'em. Go on, pick out your favorite one. It's yours for keeps. You can't give me a star. It's your Christmas present. No one owns the stars. Well, that's why you gotta claim 'em before anyone else does. Like Columbus claimed America for queen Isabella. Claiming a star for your own has just as much logic. Maybe more, because you don't have to kill and subjugate millions of people to do it. So go ahead, pick out any one you want, 'cept for betelgeuse and rigel because Lori and Brian already laid claim to them. I want that one. The bright one? Yeah. That's Venus. She's a planet. Kinda dinky compared to real stars. She just looks brighter 'cause she's closer to us. I like it anyway. What the hell. It's Christmas. You can have a planet if you want. You know, her atmosphere is a lot like the earth's, only, uh... degrees hotter. Really? So when the sun starts to burn out and the earth turns cold, everyone might wanna move to Venus to get warm. And now they're gonna have to get permission from your descendants first. I love you, kid. Love you more. I really like David. You really what? Yeah. He's not that boring. I think he'd be a nice addition to the family. Oh, by the way, i just found out my brother is planning to sell his half of mom's land. Uncle Jim? Yeah, and it's a real shame. My father always taught me you never sell... Free market, my ass! The whole thing is a rigged game, and you know it! It's a system created by all you fat cats to make yourselves richer and keep the poor where they are. It's nothing more than legalized larceny. Admit it, David. On behalf of all the fat cats, I'm not going to admit to something that's not true. David... Jeannette, it's fine. We're just talking. Yeah, we're just talking. You know what, Rex? Let's just agree to disagree. On behalf of the 90 in our country workin' for 4.75 an hour, I will do no such thing! How very noble of you. A real champion of the people. How drunk are you? How 'bout we settle this the way they did in ancient Rome, with a good old-fashioned arm wrestlin' match? Pretty sure that's not somethin' they did in Rome. Dad, enough. Come on, mountain goat! David's gonna fight for your honor. This is ridiculous. Yes, it's ridiculous. We are going home. What? You're giving up already? You're gonna just wander outta here with your tail between your legs? I'm not gonna arm wrestle you. Oh, okay, so you admit it? I'm right and you're wrong. Okay. Uh-uh. What the hell. Atta boy! No, David. This is a bad idea. Babe, it's gonna be fun. Babe, it's gonna be fun. Babe, it's gonna be fun. Dad, please. Come on. Don't you wanna give him a chance to prove me wrong? Yes, Jeannette, let me prove him wrong. Okay. You guys wanna be idiots... Yes! Yes, yes, yes! - Here we go! - Come on, Rex. Put 'em up. All right. - Let's do it. - Ready... - Straighten up. - Set... Go! Come on, Rex! Come on, David! Yay! Yay! Come on! Come on. Give him what you got. How's that feel, boy? Pick it up, David! Come on! You got it! You're gonna lose to an old man. Come on, honey! Bring it home! Bring it home! Let out the wild man! Come on, Rex! David, come on. You're stronger than this. Come on. Let's go, David. What'd I tell ya? No fight. Come on, David! Kick his ass! Stop helpin' him! - Take him down! Murder him! - Come on! Murder him, David! Honey, don't lose this! Come on! Murder that old dirty bastard! Take him down! Take him down! Go, go, go, go! Yes, yes, yes! Yes! Whoo! Dow Jones will live to see another day! Left-handed rematch! I want a left-handed rematch! No, dad. Don't be a sore loser. You ready for a lefty rematch? I'm ready for whatever you wanna throw at me, old man! Oh! What the hell, dad? - Jesus! - Shit. Well, you heard him. I mean, he said he was ready for whatever i wanted to throw at him. I think he broke my nose. It's not my fault. I have a soldier's reflex. I seriously thought you were ready. Tell your boyfriend that he needs to be careful about sayin' things he doesn't mean. He's not my boyfriend, dad. He's my fiance. Let's get you home. It's not stopping. I don't know where all the blood is coming from. Please, I don't want that. Why do you still have all these stupid boxes? David, you're drunk. Just drink some water. Let's go to bed. He punched me in the face, Jeannette. I know. You told me not to worry, and then he punched me right in the middle of the face. Everybody was shouting, it was so loud... And you screamed at me. You said ""murder him,"" shouted it right in my ear. Like a madwoman. Please just drink some water. This is serious, Jeannette. Your dad is a total nut-job. Hey, I can call him that, not you. Your mom is delusional. Poor Maureen. She's gotta be out of her mind that she's choosing to live in that dump with them. This is my family that you are talking about. I know! And they are totally insane! Jeannette, I... I want to spend the rest of my life with you, but if we're gonna try and do that together, I can't have any more of whatever that was tonight. I... I gotta... I gotta go pee. I'm gonna pee. Don't worry. It's about a 20-hour drive to Texas. I can do it in under 15. We'll be back before you know it. How did grandma Smith die? My mother was an old woman. Old women die. Did she leave you anything? What kind of question is that? Why can't we come with you? I don't wanna stay with erma. Your dad hasn't had a drink in two months. I think we deserve a little vacation. But erma hates us. Don't blame her for her misery. It's all she knows. She's a dumb witch. Actually, she's very smart. That's where your dad gets it from. ...he painted a self-portrait with a bandaged ear. Van gogh. - Who is Van gogh? - That's right. You eat what I put on your plate. You spit that out, you're gonna eat that, too. No runnin' in the house, no shoutin', no whinin', no openin' the windows or the curtains. Edgar bergen. - Who is Edgar bergen? - Edgar bergen is right. It's so weird that dad lived here when he was our age. Yeah, I thought we had it bad. Look at this. You think dad really wrote all this? Listen to this. ""There might be more than this blanket of black dust, ""the stench of the tug, ""the crunch of the coal-stained snow. ""More than the sound of her cackle, ""the cracks in her calloused hands. ""And there might be more, but I won't ever know ""because it's impossible to breathe ""when you're drowning in..."" He cusses. ""It's impossible to breathe when you're drowning in shit."" Keep it down! This is gonna be a fun week. You bring a sharpener? Yeah, in my bag downstairs. Okay. - Stop worrying. - No, erma, please. - You do what I tell you. - Stop it! Just be quiet, boy. Listen to your grandmother. - No, stop it! - Where are you going? Hold still! Hey! Get away from him! Lori! The boy's britches needed fixin'! I know what I saw. She's a pervert! You little bitch... Hey, hey, hey! Let's just calm down, okay? Come on, hold her down! Stay the hell off of me, ya little beasts! Nobody messes with our brother! No! No! Put me down! Dad, we were just protecting ourselves. Erma was grabbing his... Shut up! I don't wanna hear another damn word about whatever did or didn't happen! It don't matter! Brian's a man. He can take care of himself. Can't you? Let's go. Are you comin'? Come on, kids. Let's go inside. Come on, guys, let's go. Come on. Get out. Not if you're gonna drink. You promised. I'm not going. Wait, wait. Don't! Please, dad! You... See what you do? It was one damn drink! That's a lie, and you know it! I can smell it on your sweater! Come on, let's go. You a bloodhound all of a sudden? Why don't you go sniff your own butt for a change, 'cause that ain't smellin' too pretty these days! That's very funny! You're supposed to be at work right now! You're gonna lose another job! Why don't you go get a job instead of wastin' your time on all this crap! What the hell is this anyway? Abstract expressionism! Well, here's some realism for you! Wow. You're just like your mother! Don't you touch me! Get back here, castrating whore! - Get off me! - Come here! Maureen, you wanna jump rope? Yeah. Ready? Go. No! No! - Come on! - No! - Get up here, god damn it... - Mom! - Rose Mary! - Hold on! - Mom! - Help me! Help! God, help me! Don't let her fall! What did you do to her? I didn't do anything! Get your hands off me! I don't think you want me to let go... ow! She bit me! - Pull me in! - God damn it! He tried to kill me! Mom, are you okay? I'm okay. What do you mean, is she okay? Am I okay? She just bit me! Well, why did you push her? I didn't push her! She jumped! I swear to god! You know, she's crazy! You saw, she just bit me! I think she broke... Jesus! You are one hell of a woman, you know that? And you're a stinking, rotten drunk. But you love this stinking, rotten drunk, don't you? Oh, Rex... Hey, sweetie. You have to leave him. You know, when your dad first met my mother, he asked her why she didn't have any of my paintings on her walls, and she said she didn't want to encourage a habit with no future in it. He looked her right in the eye and said, ""to hell with the future! ""Masterpieces like these ""should be on display right now."" So he took down all her paintings and put up mine. He's never going to change. You have to leave him. I can't. Maureen, do you have any queens? Go fish! Brian, do you have any nines? Go fish! We don't need them. They're never going to take care of us, so we have to do it ourselves. We'll all go to school and start saving up so we can move out when we're old enough. If we're going to make it out of this, we have to do it together. Deal? We are getting the heck out of here. Miss bivens asked me to be editor of the paper next year. What? That's amazing! I swear, by the time you graduate, you're gonna have every school in New York fightin' over you. They're here. Don't worry about us. We'll be fine. Yeah. Hey... I left five bucks in there. Start savin' up. You're next. Dad's in the backyard. I think it's clear. I love you guys! Love you. - All right, bye! - Okay, bye! Love you! Love you! Lori, we need to go! Hey! Where the hell you think you're goin'? Guess it wasn't clear. -Hey! Lori! -Talkin' to you, girl! Get your ass outta that car now! Drive, go! You know why she left? Huh? Brian? You know why she left? Maureen? You gonna leave, too? Answer me. Answer me! - Rex... - Shut up! No, sir. Somebody take out the damn trash! - Lori? - Coast clear? Yeah. He's passed out. How is everything? Well, last night at the restaurant I met a writing professor from barnard. I told her you were gonna apply to her school, and she was really nice about it. She said she'd be happy to read your stuff. Are you serious? Yeah. She said to call her when you get up here. That's amazing. How's the escape fund looking? Oh, it's getting close. I think I've baby-sat every demon child in Welch by now. You wanna hear? Mmm-hmm. Sounds like freedom. She sounds fat. Oh, you're really gonna love it here, Jeannette. It feels like you're breathing for the first time. I don't think he's gonna let me go. Hey, come on. Don't even think about that. It doesn't matter anyway. You can do whatever... What was that? Hold on. Can you call me back? Okay. I'm sorry. Erma died. Do you think erma ever did something to dad? Like what? Like what she did to Brian. You can't think about things like that. It'll make you crazy. I'm gonna meet you back at home. Dad... I'm sorry about erma. When it's time to go, you go. I'm not talkin' about that. ""It's impossible to breathe when you're drowning in shit."" Ready to lose that bucks? You can pay me now or pay me later. You still believe in your ol' man? Do you wanna help me hustle this guy? Make some money? Yeah, okay, so... Long as you stroke his ego, he'll keep playin'. I'll pull the plug the second we've drained him. You know the drill. Robbie! Hey, Rex. Jeannette? Name's Robbie. I didn't know ol' Rex had a daughter. He has three. Rex said you like to dance. You like livin' in this town? It's all right. It ain't all right, and you know it. We're all mudbugs in a boiling pot, don't even know we're being cooked alive. I'm headin' off to Chicago soon as I can afford up savings for it. What about you? I'm savin' up to move to New York City to be with my sister. All right. Big apple. I like that city. I been there a couple times. You're gonna love it. Yup. Robbie! Do somethin' worthwhile with those damn hands of yours. Get over here, play me a game. Well, all right. ...side pocket. You sure about that, Rex? Ooh! Damn! That's four games in a damn row. That'll be bucks unless you wanna go double or nothin'. No. Take it all. You deserve it. Here you go. Wash down that humble pie. To your daughter and her big move to New York City. New York City, huh? Can't believe i let that old fart take me. I don't know if I'm ticked or impressed. Now, you know my apartment's right upstairs. Got a bunch of records ain't on that jukebox if you wanna come up and listen a bit. Thanks, but I can't. Rex, you mind if I bring your daughter upstairs for a bit, listen to some records? She's a big city girl now. She can handle herself. Holler if ya need me. You know, I can't stay long. That's all right. Just wanna play you a tune or two. I think you're gonna like this one. Hmm. Where were we? Think for dancing it's sorta like this. You tryin' to sniff my hair? No. What are you doin'? Oh. That's what i was tryin' to do. Oh. I'm not that kinda girl. Well, we'll just dance, then. All right? Whoa! How'd that happen? Okay. Robbie, what are you doing? This. Stop. I just wanna see what you got under this dress. Robbie, stop! Easy. Take it easy. Robbie... It's all right. Hey, hey! Let me show you. Mmm. Okay. There you go. Oh. Mmm-hmm. When I was a little girl, i lit myself on fire. It gets worse down there. I'm gonna go now. I knew you could handle yourself. It's like that time i taught you to swim and you thought you were gonna drown, but I knew you'd do just fine. Okay, here. Here's your cut. Take it or not. Might come in handy for the big move. I don't care what erma did to you. It's no excuse. I am movin' to New York, and there's nothin' that you can do about it. You okay? I need to get the hell outta here. Somebody sure gutted your piggy, didn't they? Any suspects? That money was mine. Why are you doin' this to us, dad? New York magazine. This is Jeannette walls. Hey, big shot. Maureen? How's your fancy life? Just gettin' ready for my fancy engagement party. We're excited to see you. I can't make it tonight. Why not? 'Cause I'm movin' to California. You're not serious? Maureen, you can't go to California. That's the other side of the country. We have to stick together. We always have. That's not true. I gotta go. I love you. Why would she go to California? It's as far away from them as she can get without swimming to Hawaii. It's our fault. We should have never left her alone with them. She would have hated this anyway. David sure doesn't. Thank you so much for coming. Who needs more bubbly? We do! Hi, handsome! Did you invite them? Oops. Look who's here. Oh! Hey. Okay, okay. Whoa! Thank you, thank you! This'll be interesting. Let's get this party started! Oh, congratulations, honey! What does an investment banker use as birth control? His personality. All right, one more. What's the difference between a bag of manure on your lawn and an investment banker? Can I speak with you for a second? I'm in the middle of a punchline. Okay, hold that thought, gents. Who is that guy? Swanky. But I don't see one of your mama's paintings. What are you doing here? Just networking with all these fantastic people. Every time someone leaves, you act like a child. You'd think you'd be used to it by now. What's that supposed to mean? It's not a surprise, dad. Maureen left because your bullshit drove her crazy. You really wanna talk about bullshit right now? Look around! This ain't you! You ain't like those pawns, and you know it! Don't turn this on me. You're a walls. You were born to change the world, not just add to the noise. You cannot marry that fool! You're better than him! And you're better than that goddamn gossip column! You're a real writer! I like my life, dad. Then why is all your crap still packed up in those boxes? What's goin' on, guys? We don't want to upset David. Why do you care so much about David all of a sudden? Well, he's like part of the family now. Right, honey? This is not the time, okay? Well, when's the right time? Not right now! Okay? Look, there were three more offers today. So you can wait till tomorrow... I have to tell her! Tell me what? Trust me, now is not the time! Tell me what, mom? Let me talk! You know how I was telling you about my brother selling his half of mom's land in Texas? Well, now that you're gettin' married and you have all these nice things, we were thinkin' that maybe we could borrow the money to buy it. So the only reason why you're being nice to David is because you want his money? No, it's not the only reason. I'm also just a nice person. You are a nice person. Thank you. We wouldn't ask if it wasn't urgent, honey. How much? No, let's not get into... About a million. A million dollars? A little under. A little under... If uncle Jim's land is worth that much, then yours is, too. Well, I don't know. I've never had it appraised. My father taught me you never sell land. - Good advice. - Right. Grandma Smith died when I was 11. Have you been sitting on a million dollars since I was 11? No, no! It appreciates over time. It escalates. You knew about this? Do you realize what we could have done with that money? I don't want my kids raised on a goddamn handout! What the hell? What the hell is wrong with you? Oh... Nice, rose. Hey, mountain goat! Don't ever call me that again! Uh, Jeannette... David, please... Come on. I know you're upset. But let's just go back and talk about this. Come on. Dad, why do you think all of us ran away from you? We were drowning. I still don't understand why you followed us here. We wanted to be a family again. We were never a family, mom. We were a nightmare. Your mom and I did everything we could for you, okay? We looked after you, and it was a happy family! Bullshit! We did it! We took care of each other because you were too drunk to! It was your job to protect us, and you didn't even try! That ain't true, okay? It is true. You got some kind of weird revisionist history goin' on. You were a happy kid! Stop it, dad. Stop talking. And they were happy kids! And we looked after you! Stop talking! Talking is not trying! You talked my whole goddamn life! And I believed you. Don't! Hey, don't do this. I don't want you in my life. Jeannette, you do not mean that. I don't want you to call or write or show up out of the blue. I don't want another one of your bullshit stories. I don't wanna see you anymore. I gotta go. See you soon, little sister. I think I figured out how to deal with the lack of sunlight on the hillside. We just need to install specially-curved mirrors to all the solar cells. See, what I was thinkin' was you don't have to go right away. You could just... Dad... You could finish school here and get a job at the Welch daily news, and I would help you write those articles. I am going. Remember how we used to do that? You remember that? You are never going to build the glass castle. Oh, I am. You're not. I am. I got it right here. And even if you do, it doesn't matter. I'm gettin' on the first bus outta here. Well... If the bus breaks down, I'm gonna walk. I am gonna finish this thing... I will hitchhike if I have to, dad. I can guaran-goddamn-tee it. Build it if you want, but don't build it for me. Hey, hey, hey! Jeannette... Mountain goat! Okay, so I'm gonna pick you up after work, and we'll head straight to the restaurant from there. Where? We have dinner with Mr. lehocky and his wife. Jeannette, remember i told you about this? Furniture designer? This guy's got more money than he knows what to do with. He made the chair that you're sitting in. Right, the furniture designer. I got it. Jeannette, please? This is a very big account, okay? This'll be huge for us. I said I got it. Okay. Can you get that? I gotta go. Mmm-hmm. Jeannette, it's me, sweetie. It's been too long. You can't ignore us forever, honey. I just really need to talk to you about somethin'. Okay? Have you been to the Picasso retrospective at moma yet? Mom... Don't waste your time. He really didn't do anything worthwhile after his rose period. All that cubist stuff is so gimmicky. Mom, I have to go back to work. Why are you here? I need to sit down. You know how I am with sentimental situations like this. It's just... I don't know what to do. What's goin' on? Your dad's sick. And he's not gettin' better. He stopped talkin' last week. Well, what does that mean? He was rantin' about that night at David's, all that stuff you said about his drinkin' and how talking isn't trying, and whatever else you said. Then he asked me if I think he talks too much, and I said, ""yeah,"" 'cause he does. And then he just stopped. Hasn't said a word since. Won't get out of bed. Barely eats. The silence is awful. He's dying, Jeannette. You have a right to be angry. You think I don't know that? Of course you do. Look, I don't wanna tell you what to do ever, but I know you love him, and I just think you'll regret it if you don't come home and say goodbye. Mom, I said goodbye a long time ago. Jeannette... The doctor told him a month if he stops drinking, which he won't, so who knows? What exactly is it? Pretty much everything you can get from four packs of cigarettes and two quarts of booze every day for years. He doesn't look good. You have to go see him. No, I don't. You're right. You don't. But you kind of do. He's done a lotta shitty things, but he's had his moments. Man in the hall! Does anybody know where Jeannette's room is? Oh, thank you kindly, ma'am. What are you snot-slingin' about? What are you doing here? I thought I'd finally come check out this high-fallutin' college o' yours. I gotta say, for the tuition i expected a bit more. Your mom says that you're jumpin' ship. What happened to all your fancy scholarships? It isn't enough. And they don't cut breaks for poor little country girls with big dreams? You can't say i didn't warn ya. Did you come all the way here from Welch just to rub it in my face? You were right. Okay? I never should've come here. Now I'm droppin' out. The hell you are! That's 950. And, uh, that there is genuine 100 mink. Should be able to pawn that for at least 50. Where did you get all this? New York City is full of poker players who wouldn't know their ass from their elbows, and your mom said I finally had a good reason to gamble. You did this for me? Since when is it wrong for a father to take care of his little girl? So it turns out Mrs. lehocky is actually a fan of yours. She reads your column every week. Rich, white and old is our target audience. I heard your mom's message on the machine. Something goin' on? It's just mom bein' mom. You know, whatever they want, please don't give in. You've been so much better without them. Have I? We've been a team for so long, it's hard to tell who does what anymore. But Ollie's always been a master craftsman. And I'm more of a visual person. Vi's the real artist of the operation. I just make sure they don't fall apart when you sit down. But when we were your age, we didn't think any of this was going to happen. We'd have been fine making chairs out of a tiny garage for the rest of our lives. Just do what makes you happy. You may make some money at it, you might not. Don't matter either way if you're doin' what you love. And what about you, Jeannette? Is this what you've always wanted to do? Uh... no, actually. I was once a political science major. I was very eager to write stories that actually matter. Your stories matter to me. Thank you. I don't know, it's just... This is not where I thought that I was gonna end up. Well, maybe you're not at the end yet. Jeannette's dad is developing a technology to burn low-grade bituminous coal more efficiently. Well, isn't that nice. Where is your dad now? Uh... I'm sorry. Would you excuse me for a second? There. How's that feel? It's so ugly, daddy. I look like the demon. Hey, there's nothin' ugly about you, you hear me? One day, I promise you, you're gonna look at this as just another sign of how strong you are. You're a walls, mountain goat. We ain't like other people. We got a fire burnin' in our bellies. And that there is goddamn proof of it. Now... This knife is specially designed to hunt demons. It's very sharp. Don't take it out unless you see him. You can borrow it for the night. You know, all monsters are the same. They like to frighten people, but the minute you stare 'em down, they turn tail and run. I love you, mountain goat. My parents are squatting in an abandoned building on the lower east side. Jeannette... They were homeless for three years before that, which is pretty much how they raised us. My dad is not developing a technology for bituminous coal, but he could tell you anything that you want to know about it. He is the smartest man that I know. He is also a drunk, never finishes what he starts, and can be extremely cruel. But he dreams bigger than anyone I've ever met. And he never tries to be somebody that he's not. And he never wanted me to, either. I'm sorry, but I have to leave. Go. You ready to go get that demon? Let's go! I'll go get some air. Leave you to it. Hey, dad. Do you remember when those grape-pickers in California went on strike, and the vineyards had to sell everything for a nickel a pound? You stuffed the car so full we couldn't see out the windows. Brian found some in his pocket two weeks later that had turned into raisins. Or when you let me pet that cheetah at the zoo? She was lickin' that popcorn butter off your hand. Those other parents wanted to chop my head off. They were just jealous. Remember when you made your own braces? They were a goddamn feat of engineering genius. It was a hanger and a rubber band. Well, by god, it worked. Look at those gorgeous choppers. Mom says you haven't been talkin' lately. Sort of takin' some time to think. Here. What's this? It's every story you've written since eighth grade. Thought maybe you could start addin' to it for me. I spent my whole life huntin' for those demons in the wild. And the entire time they were hidin' inside my own belly. Sad state to spend your life in, bein' afraid of your own self. I know it... Wasn't easy on you kids. Got a lot to regret about my life. Dad... Never forget how beautiful you are, mountain goat. And smart... And creative and strong... You're so strong. No little girl should ever have to carry her daddy on her back. You ain't like me at all, mountain goat. You're not afraid. I am like you. And I'm glad. We had some good times, didn't we? Never did build that glass castle. No. But we had a good time plannin' it. Hi! Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving. Something smells good! How's life as a freelancer? I'm still gettin' used to it. Yeah? You like bein' poor again? Thanks, Brian. Careful with my child. Hey. Maureen... I like the new place. How's California? It's really nice and sunny. Here's your housewarming present. I thought you'd like one of him. I didn't do so well with the hair, but... Do you like it, honey? It's perfect. What? What? I never told you about this? No, you didn't. He didn't have money for presents, so he takes each of us outside, and says that we can just pick out our own star. Seriously? Yeah, yeah, any one we want. So I took rigel. It's that little blue one on the foot of Orion. What was yours, Lori? And I chose betelgeuse 'cause it was this pretty shade of red, and then later that night dad told me it was only that color because it was dying! Yeah! You got the dud! You were so mad! Yeah, because he wouldn't let me pick a new one! ""'Cause there's no return policies in outer space."" ""Well, that only works for plastic toys made in Japan."" But he also said, ""when everyone else's junk is broken and forgotten, ""you'll still have your stars."" Yeah. Jeannette, what's goin' on? You okay? What are you thinkin', sweetie? I just... I feel really lucky... Let's make a toast to Rex. Life with your father was never boring. All these here are portraits of people. I have a whole box of flowers back there. Down here people like my flowers better than they did in New York. You know, Jeannette's story about how he gave her a star, what a difference between Lori's and Jeannette's. Jeannette: ""I got a star. ""Oh, daddy, you're so wonderful. ""I love you."" And Lori says, ""you goddamn son of a bitch, ""you didn't have enough money."" The star story. Dad loved grand gestures that preferably did not require a whole lot of follow-up. And he did it twice. I've made this all by my own free choice. So I haven't regretted it. It's been an experience. I've gotten a lot out of it. Even if I go down the drain, I have still come out the winner. Still come out a winner. Any idiot can see that this is a goddamn land-grab by the city officials using taxpayers' money to tear down the buildings so that they could give away the property to the goddamn developers, so the developers will pay 'em off under the table. It's not new, but it has gone as far as we're gonna let it go."
